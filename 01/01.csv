turbulence. Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on
turbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to measure. However, the
problem of separation of velocity and density fluctuations is far from being
trivial. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a test case, I review techniques
applicable to emission line studies with the emphasis on those that can provide
information on the underlying power spectra of velocity and density. I show
that recently developed mathematical machinery is promising for the purpose.
Its application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity
fluctuations dominate the small scale structures observed in spectral-line data
cubes and this result is very important for the interpretation of observational
data, including the identification of clouds. Velocity fluctuations are shown
to dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously
identified as diffuse clouds. One may argue that the HI data is consistent with
the Goldreich-Shridhar picture of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the
cascade from the scales of several kpc that this interpretation involves does
not fit well in the current paradigm of energy injection. The issue whether
magnetic field does make the turbulence anisotropic is still open, but if this
is the case, I show that studies of emission lines can provide a reliable way
of determining magnetic field direction. I discuss various techniques for
studying interstellar turbulence using emission lines, e.g. spectral
correlation functions, genus statistics and principal component analysis.

O(alpha alpha_s) two-loop contributions by an on-shell diagrammatic method,
while approximate analytic results have also been obtained via
renormalization-group-improved effective potential and effective field theory
techniques. Initial comparisons of the corresponding two-loop results revealed
an apparent discrepancy between terms that depend logarithmically on the
supersymmetry-breaking scale, and different dependences of the non-logarithmic
terms on the squark mixing parameter, X_t. In this paper, we determine the
origin of these differences as a consequence of different renormalization
schemes in which both calculations are performed. By re-expressing the on-shell
result in terms of MS-bar parameters, the logarithmic two-loop contributions
obtained by the different approaches are shown to coincide. The remaining
difference, arising from genuine non-logarithmic two-loop contributions, is
identified, and its effect on the maximal value of the lightest CP-even Higgs

approximation to the Higgs mass, the leading two-loop radiative corrections can
be absorbed to a large extent into an effective one-loop expression by
evaluating the running top quark mass at appropriately chosen energy scales.

violation in an extension of the standard model and in quantum electrodynamics
has been developed over the last decade. The framework originates in the idea
that CPT and Lorentz symmetry could be broken spontaneously in a more
fundamental theory such as string theory. These symmetry violations are
described in the standard-model extension by small terms in the Lagrangian.
Various experiments can bound these quantities. They include Penning-trap
experiments with electrons and positrons, Penning-trap experiments with protons
and antiprotons, and possible experiments with hydrogen and antihydrogen in
traps or beams. I will review aspects of the theory, outline estimated bounds
attainable in specific experiments, and present known bounds from completed

linearly. Consequently, it may indicate that the effective theory is unstable.
However, we point out that such linear dependence on $z$ can be {\it gauged

if one includes $h_{5\mu}$, Randall and Sundrum's argument for the localized

of the Poisson bracket on the brane world volume, we are then able to describe

announcement in math.AG/9907004 .
  We construct a general semiregularity map for algebraic cycles as asked for
by S. Bloch in 1972. The existence of such a semiregularity map has well known
consequences for the structure of the Hilbert scheme and for the variational
Hodge conjecture. Aside from generalizing and extending considerably previously
known results in this direction, we give new applications to deformations of
modules that encompass, for example, results of Artamkin and Mukai.
  The formation of the semiregularity map here involves powers of the cotangent
complex, Atiyah classes, and trace maps, and is defined not only for subspaces
of manifolds but for perfect complexes on arbitrary complex spaces. It
generalizes in particular Illusie's treatment of the Chern character to the
analytic context and specializes to Bloch's earlier description of the
semiregularity map for locally complete intersections as well as to the
infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map for submanifolds.

presence of a static, spatially random surface drift. Using the Wigner
distribution $\W(\x,\k,t)$ to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at
position $\x$ contained in waves with wavevector $\k$, we describe surface wave
transport over static flows consisting of two length scales; one varying
smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale comparable to
the wavelength. The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface flows augment
the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions
of the correlations of the random surface currents. These scattering terms
depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying
drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism. The
Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modifies the
scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths
with short wavelengths. Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived
for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying flow. At
yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an
equation for wave energy diffusion. The associated diffusion constant is also
expressed in terms of the surface flow correlations. Our results provide a
formal set of equations to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity,
energy, and wave scattering as a function of the slowly varying drifts and the
correlation functions of the random, highly oscillatory surface flows.
