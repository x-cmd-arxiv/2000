formation and feedback to examine the proposal that scaling laws between the
total luminosity, rotation speed, and angular momentum of disk galaxies reflect
analogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surrounding
dark matter halos. The numerical experiments follow the formation of
galaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard
Omega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the
slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in
the simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the
cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large
systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies
and in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our
numerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this
model as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly
of the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect
the self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the
halo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of
the Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of
the Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk
rotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced,
respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in
the Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy
disks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events. (abridged)

each other leading to viscoelastic phases. The rheological properties of such
phases are very interesting and have been the subject of a large number of
experimental and theoretical studies in recent years. We shall report on our
recent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of
dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium
Tosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong
viscoelasticity at low concentrations ($\sim$ 0.9 wt%) without the addition of
electrolytes. Microrheology measurements of $G(\omega)$ have been done using
diffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional
frequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second
part of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear
stress $\sigma$ is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$. In
stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for
$\dot{\gamma}$ larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier
reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a
signature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried
out extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the
time-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has
been analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show
unambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low dimensional dynamical
systems.

which the model is credible. For a first-quantized point-particle mirror, it
appears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in the
mirror's state. An accurate accounting of these energies will require a model
which recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity, and almost certainly a model
which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes, that is, a
second-quantized model.

  Let X be a symplectic manifold, with a Hamiltonian action of a compact torus

that exists between a symplectic quotient of X by T, and a collection of
iterated projective bundles over components of the set of T-fixed-points.

another result uses this to give formulae for integrals of cohomology classes
