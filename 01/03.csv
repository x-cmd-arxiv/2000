scales of interest. Assuming that GRBs trace the large scale structure in the
universe we calculate the angular correlation function for the standard CDM

Combined with the error analysis on the BATSE catalog this suggests that nearly
$10^5$ GRBs will be needed to make a positive detection of the two-point

gradient for this region is derived to be $\Delta \mu (C-T_1)$ = -0.08 mag

are thought to represent a class of enigmatic X-ray sources often found in
spiral galaxies. For some of them, the ASCA data are newly processed, or the
published spectra are reanalyzed. For others, the published results are quoted.
The ASCA spectra of all these seven sources have been described successfully
with so called multi-color disk blackbody (MCD) emission arising from
optically-thick standard accretion disks around black holes. Except the case of
M33 X-8, the spectra do not exhibit hard tails. For the source luminosities not
to exceed the Eddington limits, the black holes are inferred to have rather
high masses, up to ~100 solar masses. However, the observed innermost disk
temperatures of these objects, Tin = 1.1--1.8 keV, are too high to be
compatible with the required high black-hole masses, as long as the standard
accretion disks around Schwarzschild black holes are assumed. Similarly high
disk temperatures are also observed from two Galactic transients with
superluminal motions, GRO 1655-40 and GRS 1915+105. The issue of unusually high
disk temperature may be explained by the black hole rotation, which makes the
disk get closer to the black hole, and hence hotter.

turn to the consideration of the process of inhomogeneous reionization due to
primordial stellar sources by means of high resolution numerical simulations,
allowing for a self-consistent treatment of the above feedback processes. These

evolution of close X-ray binary systems with intermediate-mass (2.0-6.0 M_sun)

response of the donor star to mass loss, in order to determine its stability

for the binary to prevent a spiral-in and survive a highly super-Eddington
mass-transfer phase (1 << M_dot/M_Edd < 10^5) on a sub-thermal timescale, if
the convective envelope of the donor star is not too deep. These systems thus
provide a new formation channel for binary millisecond pulsars with heavy CO
white dwarfs and relatively short orbital periods (3-50 days). However, we
conclude that to produce a binary pulsar with a O-Ne-Mg white dwarf or P_orb ~1

is still considered the most plausible scenario for the formation of such a

helps to stabilize the mass transfer by widening the orbit. Binaries which
would otherwise suffer from dynamically unstable mass transfer (leading to the

survive a phase of extreme mass transfer on a sub-thermal timescale.
