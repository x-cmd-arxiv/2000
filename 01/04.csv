with the SCUBA on the JCMT at 850 and 450 micron of L1489 IRS, L1535 IRS, L1527
IRS, and TMC 1 reveal ~2000 AU elongated structures embedded in extended
envelopes. The density distribution in these envelopes is equally well fit by a
radial power-law of index p=1.0-2.0 or with a collapse model such as that of
Shu (1997: ApJ, 214, 488). This inside-out collapse model predicts 13CO, C18O,
HCO+, and H13CO+ line profiles which closely match observed spectra toward
three of our four sources. This shows that the inside-out collapse model offers
a good description of YSO envelopes, but also that reliable constraints on its
parameters require independent measurements of the density and the velocity
structure, e.g., through continuum and line observations. For the remaining
source, L1489 IRS, we find that a model consisting of a 2000 AU radius,
rotating, disk-like structure better describes the data. Possibly, this source
is in transition between the embedded Class I and the optically revealed T
Tauri phases. Two apparently starless cores are found at ~10,000 AU from L1489
IRS and L1535 IRS. They are cold, 10-15 K, contain 0.5-3.0 M_sol, and have flat
density distributions characterized by a Gaussian of ~10,000 AU FWHM. The
proximity of these cores shows that star formation in truly isolated cores is
rare even in Taurus.

3-sigma upper limit on the pulsed fraction is <35% for P>20 ms. The
Chandra/ACIS spectrum of the point source may be fit with an ideal blackbody
(kT=0.5 keV), or with BB models modified by the presence of a NS atmosphere
(kT=0.25-0.35 keV), but the temperature is higher and the inferred emitting
area lower than expected for a 300 yr old NS according to standard cooling
models. The spectrum may also be fit with a power law model (photon index
2.8-3.6). Both the spectral properties and the timing limits of the point
source are inconsistent with a young Crab-like pulsar, but are quite similar to
the properties of the anomalous X-ray pulsars. The spectral parameters are also
very similar to those of the other radio-quiet X-ray point sources in the
supernova remnants Pup A, RCW 103, and PKS 1209-52. Current limits on an
optical counterpart for the Cas A point source rule out models that invoke
fallback accretion onto a compact object if fallback disk properties are
similar to those in quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the optical
limits are marginally consistent with plausible alternative assumptions for a

generator of density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), both by
itself and in the context of a globally turbulent medium. Simulations of the
instability alone show that the condenstion process which forms a dense phase
(``clouds'') is highly dynamical, and that the boundaries of the clouds are
accretion shocks, rather than static density discontinuities. The density
histograms (PDFs) of these runs exhibit either bimodal shapes or a single peak
at low densities plus a slope change at high densities. Final static situations
may be established, but the equilibrium is very fragile: small density
fluctuations in the warm phase require large variations in the density of the
cold phase, probably inducing shocks into the clouds. This result suggests that
such configurations are highly unlikely. Simulations including turbulent
forcing show that large- scale forcing is incapable of erasing the signature of
the TI in the density PDFs, but small-scale, stellar-like forcing causes
erasure of the signature of the instability. However, these simulations do not
reach stationary regimes, TI driving an ever-increasing star formation rate.
Simulations including magnetic fields, self-gravity and the Coriolis force show
no significant difference between the PDFs of stable and unstable cases, and
reach stationary regimes, suggesting that the combination of the stellar
forcing and the extra effective pressure provided by the magnetic field and the
Coriolis force overwhelm TI as a density-structure generator in the ISM. We
emphasize that a multi-modal temperature PDF is not necessarily an indication
of a multi-phase medium, which must contain clearly distinct thermal
equilibrium phases.

characteristics of a lot of radio flares in the X-ray binaries with jets (RJXB)

programs with the RATAN-600 radio telescope of the sources: SS433, Cyg X-3,
LSI+61o303, GRS 1915+10 and some others. We also reviewed some data from the
GBI monitoring program at two frequencies and hard X-ray BATSE (20-100 keV) and
soft X-ray RTXE (2-12 keV) ASM data. We confirmed that flaring radio emission
of Cyg X-3 correlated with hard and anti-correlated with soft X-ray emission
during the strong flare (>$ Jy) in May 1997. During two orbital periods we
investigated radio light curves of the remarkable X-binary LSI+61o303. Two
flaring events near a phase 0.6 of the 26.5-day orbital period have been
detected for first time at four frequencies simultaneously. Powerful flaring
events of SS433 were detected at six frequencies in May 1996 and in May 1999.
The decay of the flare is exactly fitted by an exponential law and the rate of
the decay $\tau$ depends upon frequency as tau \propto \nu^{-0.4} in the first
flare and does not depend upon frequency in the second flare, and is equal to
\tau=6+-1 days at frequencies from 0.96 to 21.7 GHz in the last flare in May
1999. Many flaring RJXB show two, exponential and power, laws of flare decay.
Moreover, these different laws could be present in one or several flares and
commonly flare decays are faster at a higher frequency. The decay law seems to
change because of geometric form of the conical hollow jets. The synchrotron
and inverse Compton losses could explain general frequency dependences in flare
evolution. In conclusion we summarized the general radio properties of RJXB.

is of Capella and covers a wavelength range of 5-175 A (2.5-0.07 keV). The
measured wavelength resolution, which is in good agreement with ground
calibration, is $\Delta \lambda \simeq$ 0.06 A (FWHM). Although in-flight
calibration of the LETGS is in progress, the high spectral resolution and
unique wavelength coverage of the LETGS are well demonstrated by the results
from Capella, a coronal source rich in spectral emission lines. While the
primary purpose of this letter is to demonstrate the spectroscopic potential of
the LETGS, we also briefly present some preliminary astrophysical results. We
discuss plasma parameters derived from line ratios in narrow spectral bands,
such as the electron density diagnostics of the He-like triplets of carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen, as well as resonance scattering of the strong Fe XVII
line at 15.014 A.

most of the molecular species produced in the AGB phase and allow a chemistry
dominated by standard ion-neutral reactions. Not only allow these reactions the
formation of O-bearing species, but they also modify the abundances of C-rich

much lower than in AGB stars. The molecular abundances in the different regions

effects of absorption are less severe. For this reason we have carried out the
BeppoSAX High Energy LLarge Area Survey in the hardest band (5-10 keV)
accessible so far with imaging X-ray instruments. The source surface density at
the survey limiting flux accounts for a significant fraction (20-30%) of the
hard XRB. The X-ray data complemented by multiwavelength follow--up
observations suggest that a large fraction of the hard sources are AGN and that
X-ray absorption with column densities in the range 10^22-23.5 cm-2 is common
among them. The great diversity in their optical-near-IR properties suggests
that the optical appearance of obscured sources is a function of the X-ray
luminosity. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings for the XRB

stabilization and the recovery of late-cosmology features in the branes. Due to
the induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of
the radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In
the slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation
rate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum
suppresion. Hence, when rolling down the steep end of the potential towards the
stable point, the radion field (which appears as the inflaton of the effective
4D theory in the branes) decays very fast, reheats the Universe .This process
results decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\Lambda_4$.
However, at the minimum of the potential $\Lambda_4$ is small but not
neccessarily zero and the fine-tuning issue remains .Density perturbation
constraints introduce an upper bound when the radion stabilizies. Due to the
large radion mass and strong suppression to the bulk modes, moduli problems and
bulk reheating do not occur. The reheat temperature and a sufficient number of
e-folding constraints for the brane-universe are also satisfied. The model
therefore recovers the radiation dominated FRW universe.

arising due to the massive breathing mode of sphere reductions in M-theory or
string theory, allow for supersymmetric (static) domain wall solutions which
are a hybrid of a Randall-Sundrum domain wall on one side, and a dilatonic
domain wall with a run-away dilaton on the other side. On the anti-de Sitter
(AdS) side, these walls have a repulsive gravity with an asymptotic region
corresponding to the Cauchy horizon, while on the other side the runaway
dilaton approaches the weak coupling regime and a non-singular attractive
gravity, with the asymptotic region corresponding to the boundary of spacetime.
We contrast these results with the situation for gauged supergravity potentials
for massless scalar modes, whose supersymmetric AdS extrema are generically
maxima, and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds to
the boundary of the AdS spacetime. We also comment on the possibility that the
massive breathing mode may, in the case of fundamental domain-wall sources,
stabilize such walls via a Goldberger-Wise mechanism.

both noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from the
viewpoint of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Moreover, we show that this
noncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the world

partition of this set into three pieces A,B,C such that A is congruent to B

R. Robinson characterized the systems of congruences like this which could be
realized by partitions of the sphere with rotations witnessing the congruences.
The purpose of the present paper is to characterize those systems of
congruences which can be satisfied by partitions of the sphere or related
spaces (any complete metric space acted on in a sufficiently free way by a free
group of homeomorphisms) into sets with the property of Baire. Dougherty and
Foreman proved that the Banach-Tarski paradox can be achieved using such sets,
and gave versions of this result using open sets and related results about
partitions of spaces into congruent sets. The same methods are used here. We
also characterize the systems solvable on the sphere using sets with the
property of Baire but allowing all isometries (instead of just rotations).

nonmeasurable. In the present paper, we consider the problem of which systems
of congruences can be satisfied using open subsets of the sphere (or related
spaces); of course, these open sets cannot form a partition of the sphere, but
they can be required to cover ""most of"" the sphere in the sense that their
union is dense. Various versions of the problem arise, depending on whether one
uses all isometries of the sphere or restricts oneself to a free group of
rotations (the latter version generalizes to many other suitable spaces), or
whether one omits the requirement that the open sets have dense union, and so
on. While some cases of these problems are solved by simple geometrical
dissections, others involve complicated iterative constructions and/or results
from the theory of free groups. Many interesting questions remain open.

non-trivial medium (with or without boundaries, crystalline or amorphous, with
inhomogeneities, absorption and so on) is sometimes studied using the
reciprocity principle. This is a variation of the method of Green's functions.
If one is only interested in the asymptotic radiation fields the generality of
these methods may actually be a shortcoming: obtaining expressions valid for
the uninteresting near fields is not just a wasted effort but may be
prohibitively difficult. In this work we obtain a modified form the reciprocity
principle which gives the asymptotic radiation field directly. The method may
be used to obtain the radiation from a prescribed source, and also to study
scattering problems. To illustrate the power of the method we study a few
pedagogical examples and then, as a more challenging application we tackle two
related problems. We calculate the specular reflection of x rays by a rough
surface and by a smoothly graded surface taking polarization effects into
account. In conventional treatments of reflection x rays are treated as scalar
waves, polarization effects are neglected. This is a good approximation at
grazing incidence but becomes increasingly questionable for soft x rays and UV
at higher incidence angles.
