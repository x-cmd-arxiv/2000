galaxy clusters and its evolution against X-ray data. A powerful method to
investigate substructures in galaxy clusters are the power ratios introduced by
Buote & Tsai. We consider three flat cosmological models: CDM,
LCDM($\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$) and CHDM($\Omega_h = 0.2$, 1 massive $\nu$), all
normalized so to fit the observed number of clusters. For each model we built
40 clusters, using a TREESPH code, and performed a statistical comparison with
a data sample including nearby clusters observed with ROSAT PSPC instrument.
The comparison disfavors the LCDM model, as clusters appear too relaxed, while
CDM and CHDM clusters, in which a higher degree of complexity occurs, seem to
be closer to observations. A better fit of data can be expected for some
different DM mix. If DM distributions are used instead of baryons, we find
substructures more pronounced than in gas and models have a different score.
Using hydrodynamical simulations is therefore essential to our aims.

However, in the redshift range between ~ 0.08 and 0.2, where most of our

evolution of the cluster galaxy population. A large range of f_B values is also
seen between ~ 0.2 and 0.3, when Smail at al. (1998) x-ray clusters are added

unbiased sample to understand how much of the Butcher-Oemler effect is due to
evolution, and how much to selection effects. We also tested the idea proposed
by Garilli et al. (1996) that there is a population of unusually red galaxies

these objects are all near the limiting magnitude of the images (20.5<r<22) and

regions of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4631, known for its extended gaseous halo and
its tidal interactions. Previous single-dish observations revealed that almost
all of the CO emission arises from a central ring or bar-like structure of
length $\sim$ 4 kpc. We confirm this structure at higher resolution, and find
that it is bent at the center, reflecting the overall bend in this galaxy
apparent from optical images. The kinematic evidence favors a rigidly rotating
ring over a bar. The gaseous halo emission in several tracers is concentrated
above and below this molecular structure. To the north of an emission peak at
the eastern end of the structure is an extraplanar feature showing filamentary
and shell-like properties which we interpret as an energetic molecular outflow.
The energies involved are difficult to estimate, but are probably of order
10$^{54}$ ergs or more. The CO concentration in the disk below this structure
coincides with a bright HII region complex, a peak of radio emission, and the
brightest X-ray feature in the inner disk of the galaxy seen in a ROSAT HRI
map, all suggesting intense star formation. A filament of radio continuum
emission may also have a footprint in this region of the disk. The origin of
the outflow is unclear.

Propagation of shock waves and bulk-flow motion of ICM play crucial roles to
extend radio halos. In the contracting phase, radio halos are located at the
hot region of ICM, or between two substructures. In the expanding phase, on the
other hand, radio halos are located between two ICM hot regions and shows

candidate TeV gamma-ray source. We observed RXJ1713.7-3946 from May to August

evidence for TeV gamma-ray emission from the NW rim of the remnant with the

for all light curve parameters for all supernovae in each sample. Our method
fully accounts for the non-negligible covariance amongst the light curve
fitting parameters, which previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to Riess

comparison of rise times premature. Furthermore, systematic effects on rise
time determinations from the high-redshift observations, due to the form of the
late-time light curve and the manner in which the light curves of these

emission from dust injected by sources inside the core region of the Virgo
cluster is a factor of 10 below the detection limit of currently available
telescopes. The outer regions of dynamically young clusters like the Virgo
cluster have a further potential source of intracluster grains since they are
still accreting freshly infalling spiral galaxies which are presumably
contained in an accreting intergalactic medium (IGM). We show that cosmic ray
driven winds from the infalling spirals can inject grains into a subvirial IGM
that is external to the observed X-ray-emitting ICM. Sputtering during the
injection process and in the IGM is weak, so that the injected grains should
accumulate in the IGM until the infall brings them into contact with the hot
ICM. This effect dominates the dust injection rate from known sources embedded
in the hot Virgo ICM. Thus, any detection of diffuse IR emission would probe
the current dust accretion rate for the cluster, acting as an indicator of the
youth and the dynamical state of the cluster. The predictions for the Virgo

than those predicted by the chemical equilibrium. In order to reproduce the
overall shape of the optical spectra an additional opacity (AdO) is required to
be implemented in the computations. We have modelled it with a simple law [a0
(nu / nu0)^N, N=4], and found that this provides a good fit to the data. This
AdO could be due to molecular/dust absorption or to dust scattering. The EWs
and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity. The Li
line at 670.8 nm, widely used as a substellarity discriminator, is more
affected by the AdO than by the natural depletion of neutral Li. Our

to the case of a long chain molecule. The problem involves the motion of a
chain molecule of $N$ segments across a region where the free energy per
segment is higher, so that it has to cross a barrier. We consider the limit
where the length of the molecule is much larger than the width of the barrier.
The width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is
applicable to even to the portion over the barrier. We use the Rouse model and
analyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant
mechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free
energy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end
crossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on
the temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show
that there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds
to a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of
the polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink
on the chain in the reverse direction. We also consider the translocation of
hydrophilic polypeptides across hydrophobic pores, a process that is quite
common in biological systems. Biological systems accomplish this by having a
hydrophobic signal sequence at the end that goes in first. We find that for
such a molecule, the transition state resembles a hook, and this is in
agreement with presently accepted view in cell biology.

flatter nodes in Delta_k are observed along the k_x = (+/-) k_y directions in

nonlinear corrections in the k-dependence of Delta_k near the nodes introduce
new energy scales, which would lead to deviations in the predicted power-law
asymptotic behaviour of several measurable quantities, at low or intermediate
temperatures. We evaluate such deviations, either analytically or numerically,
within the interlayer pair-tunneling model, and within yet another
phenomenological model for a d-wave order parameter. We find that such
deviations are expected to be of different sign in the two cases. Moreover, the
doping dependence of the flatness of the gap near the nodes is also
attributable to Fermi surface effects, in addition to possible screening
effects modifying the in-plane pairing kernel, as recently proposed.

both the ARPES and LDA Fermi surface of Nd_2-xCe_xCuO_4-delta. The value of

functions is demonstrated as well. The same approach is applied to the RuO_2

to the class of history theories admitting quasitemporal structure (a
generalization of the concept of `temporal sequences' of `events' using partial
semigroups) and logic structure for `single-time histories'. Symmetries are
classified into orthochronous (those preserving the `temporal order' of
`events') and nonorthochronous. A straightforward criterion for physical
equivalence of histories is formulated in terms of orthochronous symmetries;
this criterion covers various notions of physical equivalence of histories
considered by Gell-Mann and Hartle as special cases. In familiar situations, a
reciprocal relationship between traditional symmetries (Wigner symmetries in
quantum mechanics and Borel-measurable transformations of phase space in
classical mechanics) and symmetries defined in this work is established. In a
restricted class of theories, a definition of conservation law is given in the
history language which agrees with the standard ones in familiar situations; in
a smaller subclass of theories, a Noether type theorem (implying a connection
between continuous symmetries of dynamics and conservation laws) is proved. The
formalism evolved is applied to histories (of particles, fields or more general
objects) in general curved spacetimes. Sharpening the definition of symmetry so
as to include a continuity requirement, it is shown that a symmetry in our
formalism implies a conformal isometry of the spacetime metric.

Specifically, we study how an upper cut on the invariant mass spectrum, which
is necessary to extract V_{ub}, results in the breakdown of the standard
perturbative expansion due to the existence of large infrared logs. We first
show how the decay rate factorizes at the level of the double differential
distribution. Then, we present closed form expressions for the resummed cut
rate for the inclusive decays B -> X_s gamma and B -> X_u e nu at
next-to-leading order in the infrared logs. Using these results, we determine
the range of cuts for which resummation is necessary, as well as the range for
which the resummed expansion itself breaks down. We also use our results to
extract the leading and next to leading infrared log contribution to the two
loop differential rate. We find that for the phenomenologically interesting cut
values, there is only a small region where the calculation is under control.
Furthermore, the size of this region is sensitive to the parameter
\bar{\Lambda}. We discuss the viability of extracting V_{ub} from the hadronic
mass spectrum.

local, causal perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is described in terms of
the BRS formalism. Local interacting field operators are constructed
perturbatively and field equations are established. A nilpotent BRS
transformation is defined on the local algebra of fields. It allows the
definition of the algebra of local observables as an operator cohomology. This
algebra of local observables can be represented in a Hilbert space.
  The interacting field operators are defined in terms of time ordered products
of free field operators. For the results above to hold the time ordered
products must satisfy certain normalization conditions. To formulate these
conditions also for field operators that contain a spacetime derivative a
suitable mathematical description of time ordered products is developed.
  Among the normalization conditions are Ward identities for the ghost current
and the BRS current. The latter are generalizations of a normalization
condition that is postulated by D""utsch, Hurth, Krahe and Scharf for Yang-Mills
theory. It is not yet proven that this condition has a solution in every order.
All other normalization conditions can be accomplished simultaneously.
  A principle for the correspondence between interacting quantum fields and
interacting classical fields is established. Quantum electrodynamics and
Yang-Mills theory are examined and the results are compared with the
literature.

set of nonsingular, quasilinear integral equations, providing inputs for
solution of the latter problem through a coupled system of algebraic equations
for a set of numerical coefficients. An incisive criterion is given for finding
the upper critical density for closure of the triplet gap. The separation
method and its development for triplet pairing exploit the existence of a small
parameter, given by a gap-amplitude measure divided by the Fermi energy. The
revised BCS equations admit analysis revealing universal properties of the full
set of solutions for $^3$P$_2$ pairing in the absence of tensor coupling,
referring especially to the energy degeneracy and energetic order of these
solutions. The angle-average approximation introduced by Baldo et al. is
illuminated in terms of the separation-transformed BCS problem and the small
parameter expansion...

Hartree-Fock approximation are very important to describe basic properties of
nuclear structure. Various approaches to account for such correlations are
described and compared to each other. This includes the hole-line expansion,
the coupled cluster or ``exponential S'' approach, the self-consistent
evaluation of Greens functions, variational approaches using correlated basis
functions and recent developments employing quantum Monte-Carlo techniques.
Details of these correlations are explored and their sensitivity to the
underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction. Special attention is paid to the
attempts to investigate these correlations in exclusive nucleon knock-out
experiments induced by electron scattering. Another important issue of nuclear
structure physics is the role of relativistic effects as contained in
phenomenological mean field models. The sensitivity of various nuclear
structure observables on these relativistic features are investigated. The
report includes the discussion of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei.

well as in finite size relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions using a BUU
cascade transport model that contains resonance and string degrees-of-freedom.
The 'infinite' hadron matter is simulated within a cubic box with periodic
boundary conditions. The various equilibration times depend on baryon density
and energy density and are much shorter for particles consisting of light
quarks then for particles including strangeness. For kaons and antikaons the
chemical equilibration time is found to be larger than $\simeq$ 40 fm/c for all
baryon and energy densities considered. The inclusion of continuum excitations,
i.e. hadron 'strings', leads to a limiting temperature of $T_s\simeq$ 150 MeV.
We, furthermore, study the expansion of a hadronic fireball after
equilibration. The slope parameters of the particles after expansion increase
with their mass; the pions leave the fireball much faster then nucleons and
accelerate subsequently heavier hadrons by rescattering ('pion wind'). If the
system before expansion is close to the limiting temperature $T_s$, the slope
parameters for all particles after expansion practically do not depend on
(initial) energy and baryon density. Finally, the equilibration in relativistic
nucleus-nucleus collision is considered. Since the reaction time here is much
shorter than the equilibration time for strangeness, a chemical equilibrium of
strange particles in heavy-ion collisions is not supported by our transport
calculations. However, the various particle spectra can approximately be
described within the blast model.

these cross sections follow a scaling law with the projectile charge which is
different from the one previously proposed basing on a classical over-barrier

paper we develop a ""semi-classical"" (i.e. including some quantal features) OBM

ion-hydrogen collisions and compared with the result of a sophisticated
quantum-mechanical calculation. In the former case the accordance is very good,
while in the latter one no so satisfactory results are found. A qualitative
explanation for the discrepancies is attempted.
