  newpasp style",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The potential of photometric methods for the identification of l, the degree
of spherical surface harmonic of a pulsating star, is investigated with special
emphasis on Stromgren photometry applied to delta Scuti and gamma Dor
variables. Limitations of actual model atmospheres when fine precision is
required for the calculations of partial derivatives and integrals, which
depend on limb darkening coefficients, are discussed. Two methods are discussed
to calculate the phase lags, the angle between maximum temperature and minimum
radius, and R, a parameter which describes departure from adiabaticity of the
atmospheres of these pulsating stars. These quantities appear to be very
dependent on the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory. When
one of the methods is applied to the gamma Dor stars gives phase lags close to
0 degrees, which are 90-180 degrees out of phase from typical delta Scuti
stars. Examples are given for some High Amplitude Delta Scuti Stars (HADS)
where the method can be easily applied and gives results consistent to
interpret them as radial (l=0) pulsating stars. Other low amplitude delta Scuti
stars could be oscillating in a non-radial (l=1, 2) mode. Multi-band photometry
is concluded to be a very powerful tool for mode identification of delta Scuti
and gamma Dor stars, specially with the more accurate photometry that will be
achieved in the near future with the asteroseismological space missions now in
progress.

mass stars (0.1 - 0.5 M_sun) and solar analogues (0.6 - 1.1 M_sun). We
investigate the effect of rotation on the effective temperature and luminosity
of these stars. We find that the decrease in T_eff and L can be significant at
the higher end of our mass range, but becomes negligible below 0.4 M_sun.
Formulae for relating T_eff to mass and v_rot are presented.
  We compare our models to rotational data from young open clusters of
different ages to infer the rotational history of low mass stars, and the
dependence of initial conditions and rotational evolution on mass. We find that
the qualitative conclusions for stars below 0.6 M_sun do not depend on the
assumptions about internal angular momentum transport, which makes these low
mass stars ideal candidates for the study of the angular momentum loss law and
distribution of initial conditions. We find that neither models with solid body
nor differential rotation can simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar
spin down in the 0.6 to 1.1 M_sun mass range and for stars between 0.1 and 0.6
M_sun. The most likely explanation is that the saturation threshold drops more
steeply at low masses than would be predicted with a simple Rossby scaling. In
young clusters there is a systematic increase in the mean rotation rate with
decreased temperature below 3500 K (0.4 M_sun). This suggests either
inefficient angular momentum loss or mass-dependent initial conditions for
stars near the fully convective boundary. (abridged)

responsible for magnetogenesis: i) the breakout of I-fronts from protogalaxies,
and ii) the propagation of I-fronts through the high density neutral filaments
which are part of the cosmic web. The first mechanism is dominant prior to
overlapping of ionized regions (z ~ 7), whereas the second continues to operate
even after that epoch. However, after overlap the field strength increase is
largely due to the gas compression occurring as cosmic structures form. As a
consequence, the magnetic field at z ~ 5 closely traces the gas density, and it
is highly ordered on megaparsec scales. The mean mass-weighted field strength
is B_0 ~ 10^{-19} G in the simulation box. There is a relatively well-defined,
nearly linear correlation between B_0 and the baryonic mass of virialized
objects, with B_0 ~ 10^{-18} G in the most massive objects (M ~ 10^9 M_sun) in
our simulations. This is a lower limit, as lack of numerical resolution
prevents us from following small scale dynamical processes which could amplify
the field in protogalaxies. Although the field strengths we compute are
probably adequate as seed fields for a galactic dynamo, the field is too small
to have had significant effects on galaxy formation, on thermal conduction, or
on cosmic ray transport in the intergalactic medium. It could, however, be
observed in the intergalactic medium through innovative methods based on
analysis of gamma-ray burst photon arrival times.

proposed which takes account of both relativistic effects and
intrinsic/environmental asymmetries to explain the structural asymmetries of
their radio lobes. A key parameter of the model is the jet-side of the double
sources, which is estimated for 80% of the FRII sources in the 3CRR complete
sample. Statistical analyses of the properties of these sources show that the
asymmetric model is in agreement with a wide range of observational data, and
that the relativistic and intrinsic asymmetry effects are of comparable
importance. Intrinsic/environmental asymmetry effects are more important at
high radio luminosities and small physical scales. The mean translational speed
of the lobes is found to be 0.11c, consistent with the speeds found from
spectral ageing arguments. According to a Gaussian model, the standard
deviation of lobe speeds is 0.04c. The results are in agreement with an
orientation-based unification scheme in which the critical angle separating the
radio galaxies from quasars is about 45 degrees.

present a faint extension, slightly to the blue of the main concentration of
clump stars. We point out that a similar structure is present in the CMD of NGC
7789, and discuss their possible origins. This feature may be understood as the
result of having, at the same time, stars of low-mass which undergo the
helium-flash, and those just massive enough for avoiding it. The ages of both
clusters are compatible with this interpretation. Similar features can be
produced in theoretical models which assume a non-negligible mass spread for
clump stars, of about 0.2 Mo. However, one can probably exclude that the
observed effect is due to the natural mass range of core helium burning stars
found in single isochrones, although present models do not present the level of
detail necessary to completely explore this possibility. Also the possibility
of a large age spread among cluster stars can be refuted on observational
grounds. We then suggest a few alternatives. This spread may be resulting
either from star-to-star variations in the mass-loss rates during the RGB
phase. Alternatively, effects sush as stellar rotation or convective core
overshooting, could be causing a significant spread in the core mass at
He-ignition for star of similar mass. Finally, we point out that similar

found to vary widely, 1.5 < t < 18 Gyr, while metallicities [Z/H] and
enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are strongly peaked around <[Z/H]>=+0.26 and
<[E/Fe]>=+0.20 (in an aperture of radius Re/8). The enhancement ratios are
milder than previous estimates, owing to the application of non-solar abundance
corrections to both Mgb and <Fe> for the first time. Gradients in stellar
populations within galaxies are found to be mild, with SSP-equivalent age
decreasing by 25%, metallicity decreasing by <[Z/H]>=0.20 dex, and [E/Fe]
remaining nearly constant out to an aperture of radius Re/2 for nearly all

uncertainties in the stellar evolution prescription, the oxygen abundance, the
effect of non-solar abundances on the isochrones, and other unknowns. However,
the relative age rankings of stellar populations should be largely unaffected
by these errors. In particular, the large spread in ages appears to be real and
cannot be explained by contamination of Hbeta by blue stragglers or hot
horizontal branch stars, or by fill-in of Hbeta by emission. Correlations
between these derived SSP-equivalent parameters and other galaxy observables

seven simulation runs with different assumptions on the thermal state of the

algorithm so as to phenomenologically incorporate the galaxy formation by
decoupling the cooled gas particles from the hot gas particles. All the
simulations employ 128^3 particles both for dark matter and for gas components,
and thus constitute the largest systematic catalogues of simulated clusters in
the SPH method performed so far. These enable us to compare the analytical
predictions on statistical properties of X-ray clusters against our direct
simulation results in an unbiased manner. We find that the luminosities of the
simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the thermal history and also to the
numerical resolution of the simulations, and thus are not reliable. On the
other hand, the mass-temperature relation for the simulated clusters is fairly
insensitive to the assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas,
robust against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the
analytic prediction. Therefore the prediction for the X-ray temperature
function of clusters on the basis of the Press-Schechter mass function and the

are chosen to test the abilities and limitations of the RASS in terms of
cluster fluxes and cluster morphologies. Therefore some ``worst'' cases are
used here. X-ray observations with the ROSAT/HRI and optical spectroscopic
observations are carried out. The ROSAT/HRI observations, which have a much
better spatial resolution than the RASS, reveal in two of the three cases a
significantly different morphology than seen in the RASS. The reasons are point
sources which could not be resolved in the RASS and were therefore confused
with the cluster emission. For A3570 we could confirm the relaxed state of the
cluster by the optical determination of a small velocity dispersion. In the
cluster with the lowest flux (Abell 901) the countrate measurement is strongly
affected by point sources, in the two other cases the countrate measurements of
the RASS are reliable, i.e. they are reproduced by the ROSAT/HRI measurement.
We conclude that for clusters with a flux of a few times 10^{-12} erg/cm^2/s or
smaller, which show at the same time a non-relaxed morphology, the flux
measurement of the RASS can be seriously affected by fore- or background
sources. We point out that an all-sky survey of a second ABRIXAS mission would

galactic magnetic field upon the observed properties of ultra high energy
cosmic rays. Magnetic fields deflect cosmic ray trajectories, causing flux
(de)magnification, formation of multiple images of a single source, and time
delays. We derive the energy dependence of these effects near the caustics at
which the flux amplification of a point source diverges. We show that the large
magnification of images around caustics leads to an amplification bias, which
can make them dominate the flux in some energy ranges. We argue that clustering
in the arrival directions of UHECRs of comparable energy may be due to magnetic
lensing around caustics. We show that magnetic lensing can also significantly
alter the observed composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. We also
show that the time delay between events from a single image may monotonically
decrease with decreasing energy in the neighborhood of a caustic, opposite to
its behaviour in normal regions.

Presently, there is a resurgence of interest in it, mainly for two reasons: (i)
Experimental investigations are under way with ever increasing precision, be it
in the laboratory or by observing outer space. (ii) One desires to test out
alternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a
gauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity.
A clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics.
If one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and
magnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the
excitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of
the metric or the linear connection of spacetime. In other words, there is
still no coupling to gravity. Only the constitutive law H= functional(F)
mediates such a coupling. We discuss the different ways of how metric,
nonmetricity, torsion, and curvature can come into play here. Along the way, we
touch on non-local laws (Mashhoon), non-linear ones (Born-Infeld,
Heisenberg-Euler, Plebanski), linear ones, including the Abelian axion (Ni),
and find a method for deriving the metric from linear electrodynamics (Toupin,
Schoenberg). Finally, we discuss possible non-minimal coupling schemes.

solely due to the mixing in the right-handed neutrino sector, and (4) unrelated
Dirac and Majorana sectors of neutrino masses. It is shown that large mixing
governing the dominant channel of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations can be
naturally obtained and that this constrained seesaw mechanism favours the
normal mass hierarchy for the light neutrinos leading to a small $U_{e3}$ entry
of the lepton mixing matrix and a mass scale of the lightest right handed
neutrino $M\simeq 10^{10} - 10^{11}$ GeV. Any of the three main neutrino
oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem can be accommodated. The
inverted mass hierarchy and quasi-degeneracy of neutrinos are disfavoured in
our scheme.

result from the negative strain rate dependence of the flow stress. The latter
is assumed to result from the competition of a few relevant time scales
controlling the dynamics of jerky flow. We address the issue of time scales and
its connection to the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress
within the framework of a model for the jerky flow which is known to reproduce
several experimentally observed features including the negative strain rate
sensitivity of the flow stress. We attempt to understand the above issues by
analyzing the geometry of the slow manifold underlying the relaxational
oscillations in the model. We show that the nature of the relaxational
oscillations is a result of the atypical bent geometry of the slow manifold.
The analysis of the slow manifold structure helps us to understand the time
scales operating in different regions of the slow manifold. Using this
information we are able to establish connection with the strain rate
sensitivity of the flow stress. The analysis also helps us to provide a proper
dynamical interpretation for the negative branch of the strain rate
sensitivity.

a scalar field inside a reflecting sphere of radius $R$, we study the behaviour
of the system in free space as the limit of an arbitrarily large radius in the
confined solution. From a mathematical point of view we show that this way of
facing the problem is not equivalent to consider the system {\it a} {\it
priori} embedded in infinite space. In particular, the matrix elements of the
transformation turning the system to principal axis, do not tend to
distributions in the limit of an arbitrarily large sphere as it should be the
case if the two procedures were mathematically equivalent. Also, we introduce
""dressed"" coordinates which allow an exact description of the oscillator
radiation process for any value of the coupling, strong or weak. In the case of
weak coupling, we recover from our exact expressions the well known decay
formulas from perturbation theory.

equation including dynamic charge. This charge derives from density
oscillations of a particle; it is not discrete, but continuous. Within the
dynamic model of hydrogen it accounts for all features of electron proton
interactions, its origin are density oscillations of the proton. We propose a
new system of electromagnetic units, based on meter, kilogram, and second,
bearing on these findings. The system has none of the disadvantages of
traditional three-unit systems. On the basis of our theoretical model we can
genuinely derive the scaling factor between electromagnetic and mechanic
variables, which is equal, within a few percent, to Planck's constant h. The
implications of the results in view of unifying gravity and quantum theory are
discussed. It seems that the hypothetical solar gravity waves, in the low
frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum, are open to experimental
detection.
