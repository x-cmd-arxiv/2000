Within the new error circles we found a relatively faint (V=20.1) early type
reddened star (V-R=2.24). The optical spectrum shows a strong Halpha emission

the Halpha-emitting star (K'=11.4, J-K'=1.94) which is likely surrounded by a

degeneracies in cosmological parameter determinations from other measurements.
The Lya forest P(k) provides the first measurement of the slope of the linear

inflationary CDM scenario: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primeval
fluctuations (n~1) that bends towards k^{n-4} on small scales. Considering
additional observational data, we find that COBE-normalized, Omega_m=1 models

best overall fit, even without the direct evidence for cosmic acceleration from

cooling supernova remnants (SNRs) is an important source of photoionization,
particularly for gas in the halo. We find that in many regions at high latitude
this source is adequate to account for the observed ionization so there is no
need to find ways to transport stellar photons from the disk. The flux from
cooling SNRs sets a floor on the ionization along any line of sight. Our model
flux is also shown to be consistent with the diffuse soft X-ray background and
with soft X-ray observations of external galaxies.
  We consider the ionization of the clouds observed towards the halo star HD
93521, for which there are no O stars close to the line of sight. We show that
the observed ionization can be explained successfully by our model EUV/soft
X-ray flux from cooling hot gas. In particular, we can match the H alpha
intensity, the S++/S+ ratio, and the C+* column. From observations of the
ratios of columns of C+* and either S+ or H0, we are able to estimate the
thermal pressure in the clouds. The slow clouds require high (~10^4 cm^-3 K)
thermal pressures to match the N(C+*)/N(S+) ratio. Additional heating sources
are required for the slow clouds to maintain their ~7000 K temperatures at

variability in high energy bands {\em lags} behind that in low energy bands ---
associated both with broad-band variability and quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO). However, the situation is more complicated for the QPO: while hard lag
was measured for the first harmonic of the signal, the fundamental component
showed significant {\em soft} lag. Such behavior is remarkably similar to what
was observed of microquasar GRS 1915+105. The phase lag evolved during the
initial rising phase of the 1998 outburst. The magnitude of both the soft and
hard lags of the QPO increases with X-ray flux, while the Fourier spectrum of
the broad-band lag varies significantly in shape. The coherence function is
relatively high and roughly constant at low frequencies, and begins to drop
almost right after the first harmonic of the QPO. It is near unity at the
beginning and decreases rapidly during the rising phase. Also observed is that
the more widely separated the two energy bands are the less the coherence
function between the two. It is interesting that the coherence function
increases significantly at the frequencies of the QPO and its harmonics. We
discuss the implications of the results on the models proposed for BHCs.

due to the poor submm spatial resolution. However, the proportionality of both
cm and submm data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution
radio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy can be exploited to
locate submm sources. In this paper we present results from a targeted SCUBA
survey of micro-Jansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep
Field. Even with relatively shallow 850-micron SCUBA observations (>6 mJy at
3-sigma), we were successful at making submm detections of optical/NIR-faint
(I>24 and K~21-22) radio sources, and our counts closely match the bright
counts from submm surveys. Redshift estimates can be made from the ratio of the
submm flux to the radio flux across the 100 GHz break in the spectral energy
distribution. This millimetric redshift estimation places the bright submm
population at z=1-3 where it forms the high redshift tail of the faint radio
population. The star formation rate density (SFRD) due to ultraluminous
infrared galaxies increases by more than two orders of magnitude from z~0 to
z~1-3. The SFRD at high redshift inferred from our >6 mJy submm observations is
comparable to that observed in the UV/optical. (Abridged)

against peculiar velocities predicted from a smoothed galaxy density field
leads to a biased estimate of the cosmological density parameter Omega, even
when galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution and galaxy positions and
velocities are known perfectly. The bias arises because the errors in the
predicted velocities are correlated with the predicted velocities themselves.
We investigate this bias using cosmological N-body simulations and analytic
arguments. In linear perturbation theory, for cold dark matter power spectra
and Gaussian or top hat smoothing filters, the bias in Omega is always
positive, and its magnitude increases with increasing smoothing scale. This
linear calculation reproduces the N-body results for Gaussian smoothing radii
R_s > 10 Mpc/h, while non-linear effects lower the bias on smaller smoothing
scales, and for R_s < 3 Mpc/h Omega is underestimated rather than
overestimated. The net bias in Omega for a given smoothing filter depends on
the underlying cosmological model. The effect on current estimates of Omega
from velocity-velocity comparisons is probably small relative to other
uncertainties, but taking full advantage of the statistical precision of future
peculiar velocity data sets will require either equal smoothing of the
predicted and measured velocity fields or careful accounting for the biases
discussed here.

in determining the metallicity of RR Lyrae stars, and has allowed us to obtain
the most complete and homogeneous metallicity data to date for the RR Lyrae
stars in this cluster. For RR Lyrae stars in common with the Delta-S
observations of Butler et al. (1978) and Gratton et al. (1986), we have found
that our metallicities, [Fe/H](hk), deviate systematically from their Delta-S
metallicity, while our [Fe/H](hk) for well observed field RRab stars are
consistent with previous spectroscopic measurements. We conclude that this is
due to the larger errors associated with the previous Delta-S observations for
this cluster. The Mv(RR) - [Fe/H] and period-shift - [Fe/H] relations obtained
from our new data are consistent with the evolutionary models predicted by Lee
(1991), confirming that the luminosity of RR Lyrae stars depends on
evolutionary status as well as metallicity. Using the period - amplitude

corresponding to the non-observability of the innermost parts of the accretion
disk, and two softer states with a fully observable disk. These two soft states
represent different temperatures of the accretion disk, related to different
local values of the accretion rate. The transitions between these states can be
extremely fast. The source moves between these three states following certain

fainter. Published results from HST and ground-based galaxy catalogs seem to
differ by as much as a factor of 3, and it is not clear whether the correlation
amplitude as a function of magnitude increases or decreases in the faintest
magnitude bins. In order to clarify the situation, we present new results from
both ground-based and HST galaxy catalogs. The angular two-point correlation
function as a function of limiting R and I magnitudes was computed from a
galaxy catalog created from the Hubble Deep Field - South (HDF-S) WFPC2 image.
The measured amplitudes of the correlation at an angular separation of 1 arcsec
are consistent with those measured in the Northern counter part of the field.
The flanking fields (FF fields) of the Hubble deep fields were used to extend
the magnitude range for which we compute correlation amplitudes towards
brighter magnitude bins. This allows easier comparison of the amplitudes to
ground based data. The newly measured correlation amplitudes as a function of
magnitude limit were compared to previously published measurements at larger
separations. For this comparison, the correlation function was approximated by
a power law with an index of 0.8. The scatter in the correlation amplitudes is
too large to be explained by random errors. We argue that the most likely cause
is the assumption that the shape of the correlation function does not depend on
the magnitude limit.

galaxy NGC 2992, discovered by means of new hard X-ray data. While the 2-10 keV
flux declined by a factor of ~ 20 from 1978 to 1994, two recent BeppoSAX
observations in 1997 and in 1998 caught the nuclear emission raising back to
the same level of activity observed in 1978.
  In both BeppoSAX observations the X-ray spectrum of the source is well
represented by a power law with spectral index Gamma ~ 1.7, absorbed by a
column density of N_H ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and characterized by a prominent iron
K\alpha line. While in the second BeppoSAX data set the line properties appear
to be consistent with those expected from accretion disc models, in the first
BeppoSAX data set the iron feature is rather peculiar. The broadening is not
significant and the line energy is E_{K\alpha}=6.62 +/- 0.07 keV, indicating
emission from highly ionized iron. The line has too high equivalent width (~
700 eV) to be produced by a hot scattering medium. By comparing these data with
data previously in the literature, we interpret the spectral and flux changes
in terms of different phases of rebuilding an accretion disc. The timescale for
the disc rebuilding is estimated to range between 1 and 5 years.
  The X-ray data are complemented with optical and near-infrared followup
spectra taken 1.5 months after the discovery of the X-ray burst. The spectra
are characterized by prominent broad emission lines. There is also evidence for
hot dust emission in the H and K bands that, however, is probably still in the
process of increasing.

halo of a dark-matter dominated edge-on disk galaxy at z=0.4. The population of
flat-spectrum radio sources with micro-Jy flux-densities detected with the
Square-Kilometer-Array is expected to have dimensions of micro-arcsec. They
will therefore vary rapidly as a result of Galactic scintillation (diffractive
and refractive). However, when positioned behind distant galaxies they will
also show variations due to microlensing, even more strongly than in the case
of B1600+434. Relativistic or superluminal motion in these background sources
typically leads to temporal variations on time scales of days to weeks.
Scintillation and microlensing can be distinguished, and separated, by their
different characteristic time scales and the frequency dependence of their
modulations. Monitoring studies with Square-Kilometer-Array at GHz frequencies
will thus probe both microscopic and macroscopic properties of dark matter and
its mass-function as a function of redshift, information very hard to obtain by
any other method.

  ratio at redshift z > 2","ApJ (accepted)",,"10.1086/308977",,"astro-ph",,"  Relative elemental abundances, and in particular the alpha/Fe ratio, are an
important diagnostic tool of the chemical evolution of damped Ly alpha systems
(DLAs). The S/Zn ratio is not affected by differential dust depletion and is an
excellent estimator of the alpha/Fe ratio. We report 6 new determinations of
sulphur abundance in DLAs at zabs greater than or equal to 2 with already known
zinc abundances. The combination with extant data from the literature provides
a measure of the S/Zn abundance ratio for a total of 11 high redshift DLA
systems. The observed [S/Zn] ratios do not show the characteristic [alpha/Fe]
enhancement observed in metal-poor stars of the Milky Way at comparable level
of metallicity ([Zn/H] ~ -1). The behaviour of DLAs data is consistent with a
general trend of decreasing [S/Zn] ratio with increasing metallicity [Zn/H].
This would be the first evidence of the expected decrease of the alpha/Fe ratio
in the course of chemical evolution of DLA systems. However, in contrast to
what observed in our Galaxy, the alpha/iron-peak ratio seems to attain solar
values when the metallicity is still low ([Zn/H] < -1) and to decrease below
solar values at higher metallicities. The behaviour of the alpha/Fe ratio
challenges the frequently adopted hypothesis that high redshift DLAs are
progenitors of spiral galaxies and favours instead an origin in galaxies
characterized by low star formation rates, in agreement with the results from
imaging studies of low redshift DLAs, where the candidate DLA galaxies show a
variety of morphological types including dwarfs and LSBs and only a minority of
spirals.

at various stages of its activity before that, in the spring and fall of 1999.
The fluxes range between 0.012 and 0.3 Crab units (2-10 keV). The NFI
observation is unique because it is the longest semi-continuous observation of
SAX J1819.3-2525 so far, and it offers a study of the spectrum at a relatively
high resolution of 8% full width at half maximum at 6 keV. We discuss the
observations with emphasis on the X-ray spectrum. A strong Fe-K emission line
was detected in SAX J1819.3-2525 with an equivalent width between 0.3 and 1
keV. The line energy is up to 6.85 +/- 0.02 keV and suggests the presence of
highly ionized iron. We identify this as fluorescent emission from a
photo-ionized plasma. The continuum spectrum is typical for a low-mass X-ray
binary in which emission from an accretion disk corona plays an important role.
There is no sign of an eclipse or periodic signal due to the binary orbit in
this exposure, despite the fact that the twin jets seen at radio wavelengths
suggest a high inclination angle.

the effect of this type of transformation on the topography of the potential
energy surface. The transformation, which physically corresponds to a
compression of the cluster, firstly reduces the number of stationary points on
the potential energy surface. Secondly, we show that for a 38-atom cluster with
a face-centred-cubic global minimum the transformation causes the potential
energy surface to become increasingly dominated by the funnel associated with
the global minimum. The transformation has been incorporated in the

birthmarks that the author has come across developing GUI class libraries.
C++'s view of classes, instances and hierarchies appears tantalizingly close to
GUI concepts of controls, widgets, window classes and subwindows. OO models of
C++ and of a window system are however different. C++ was designed to be a
""static"" language with a lexical name scoping, static type checking and
hierarchies defined at compile time. Screen objects on the other hand are
inherently dynamic; they usually live well beyond the procedure/block that
created them; the hierarchy of widgets is defined to a large extent by layout,
visibility and event flow. Many GUI fundamentals such as dynamic and geometric
hierarchies of windows and controls, broadcasting and percolation of events are
not supported directly by C++ syntax or execution semantics (or supported as
""exceptions"" -- pun intended). Therefore these features have to be emulated in
C++ GUI code. This leads to duplication of a graphical toolkit or a window
manager functionality, code bloat, engaging in unsafe practices and forgoing of
many strong C++ features (like scoping rules and compile-time type checking).
This paper enumerates a few major C++/GUI sores and illustrates them on simple
examples.

variants and point out a weakness in both. The first variant where the drop
probability is independent from the packet size discriminates connections with
smaller MTUs. The second variant results in a very high Packet Loss Ratio
(PLR), and as a consequence low goodput, for connections with higher MTUs. We
show that fairness in terms of loss and goodput can be supplied through an
appropriate setting of the RED algorithm.

transformations of the solution space of vacuum Einstein equations with
two-dimensional Abelian groups of isometries are considered in the context of
the so called ""monodromy transform approach"", which provides some general base
for the study of various integrable space - time symmetry reductions of
Einstein equations. Similarly to the scattering data used in the known spectral
transform, in this approach the monodromy data for solution of associated
linear system characterize completely any solution of the reduced Einstein
equations, and many physical and geometrical properties of the solutions can be
expressed directly in terms of the analytical structure on the spectral plane
of the corresponding monodromy data functions. The Belinskii and Zakharov
vacuum soliton generating transformations can be expressed in explicit form
(without specification of the background solution) as simple
(linear-fractional) transformations of the corresponding monodromy data
functions with coefficients, polynomial in spectral parameter. This allows to
determine many physical parameters of the generating soliton solutions without
(or before) calculation of all components of the solutions. The similar
characterization for electrovacuum soliton generating transformations is also
presented.

introducing a distance between spaces.
  We first introduce the spectral distance, which is a measure of closeness
between spaces defined in terms of the spectra of the Laplacian. Then we define
a space S, the space of all spaces equipped with the spectral distance. We
argue that this space S can be regarded as a metric space and that it also
possess other desirable properties. These facts make the space S a suitable
arena for spacetime physics.
  We apply the spectral framework to the averaging problem:
  We sketch the model-fitting procedure in terms of the spectral
representation, and also discuss briefly how to analyze the dynamical aspects
of the averaging procedure with this scheme.
  In these analyses, we are naturally led to the concept of the apparatus- and
the scale-dependent effective evolution of the universe. These observations
suggest that the spectral scheme seems to be suitable for the quantitative
analysis of the averaging problem in cosmology.

3) is a subgroup of index 2 in a certain ``Clifford group'' C_m (an
extraspecial group of order 2^(1+2m) extended by an orthogonal group). This
group and its complex analogue CC_m have arisen in recent years in connection
with the construction of orthogonal spreads, Kerdock sets, packings in
Grassmannian spaces, quantum codes, Siegel modular forms and spherical designs.
  In this paper we give a simpler proof of Runge's 1996 result that the space
of invariants for C_m of degree 2k is spanned by the complete weight
enumerators of the codes obtained by tensoring binary self-dual codes of length
2k with the field GF(2^m); these are a basis if m >= k-1. We also give new
constructions for L_m and C_m: let M be the Z[sqrt(2)]-lattice with Gram matrix
[2, sqrt(2); sqrt(2), 2]. Then L_m is the rational part of the mth tensor power
of M, and C_m is the automorphism group of this tensor power. Also, if C is a
binary self-dual code not generated by vectors of weight 2, then C_m is
precisely the automorphism group of the complete weight enumerator of the
tensor product of C and GF(2^m). There are analogues of all these results for
the complex group CC_m, with ``doubly-even self-dual code'' instead of
``self-dual code''.

$q=1$ these functions are also known as hypergeometric functions of matrix
argument which are related to zonal spherical polynomials for $GL(N,C)/U(N)$
symmetric space. We show that these multivariable hypergeometric functions are
tau-functions of the KP hierarchy. At the same time they are the ratios of Toda
lattice tau-functions considered by Takasaki in \cite{Tinit}, \cite{T}
evaluated at certain values of higher Toda lattice times. The variables of the
hypergeometric functions are related to the higher times of those hierarchies
via Miwa change of variables. The discrete Toda lattice variable shifts
parameters of hypergeometric functions. Hypergeometric functions of type
${}_pF_s$ can be also viewed as group 2-cocycle for the $\Psi$DO on the circle
of the order $p-s \leq 1$ (the group times are higher times of TL hierarchy and
the arguments of hypergeometric function). We get the determinant
representation and the integral representation of special type of KP
tau-functions, these results generalize some of Milne's results in
\cite{Milne}. We write down a system of linear differential and difference
equations for these tau-functions (string equations). We present also fermionic
representation for special type of Gelfand-Graev hypergeometric functions.

beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force and the
creation of matter during the Big Bang. Previous measurements of the neutron
lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors; however, these
could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in
a magnetic trap. Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for
studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long
interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report
the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with
superfluid 4-He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a
scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons have a lifetime in the trap of 750
+330/-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses.
Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process
and magnetic trapping of neutrons. Further refinement of this method should
lead to improved precision in the neutron lifetime measurement.

relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both in transverse and radial direction, in
comparison to experimental data from 150 A MeV to 11 A GeV. To this aim the
collective dynamics of the nucleus-nucleus collision is described within a
transport model of the coupled channel RBUU type. There are two factors which
dominantly determine the baryon flow at these energies: the momentum dependence
of the scalar ($U_S$) and vector potentials ($U_\mu$) for baryons and the
resonance/string degrees of freedom for energetic hadron excitations. We fix
the explicit momentum dependence of the nucleon-meson couplings by the nucleon
optical potential up to 1 GeV and extrapolate to higher energy. When assuming
the optical potential to vanish identically for $E_{kin} \geq 3.5$ GeV we
simultaneously describe the sideward flow data of the PLASTIC BALL, FOPI, EoS
and E877 collaborations, the elliptic flow data of the E895 and E877
collaborations and approximately the rapidity and transverse mass distribution
of protons at AGS energies without employing any {\it explicit} assumption on a
phase transition in the EoS. However, the gradual change from hadronic to
string degrees of freedom with increasing bombarding energy can be viewed as a
transition from {\it hadronic} to {\it string} matter, i.e. a dissolution of
hadrons at high energy density.

cavity at any time. We analyze the differences between the present system,
called the Dicke micromaser, and an equivalently pumped conventional one-atom
micromaser. These differences are attributed to the Dicke cooperativity in the
two-atom system. We also show that the two-atom Dicke micromaser is equivalent
to a one-atom cascade two-photon micromaser. With the introduction of a
one-photon detuning, the present theory further describes a true two-photon
micromaser. We discuss in detail the role of one-photon detuning in the
mechanism of a one-atom two-photon micromaser. This leads us to point out that
the two-atom cavity dynamics can be verified by a proper scaling of the results
