produced by a vast, hitherto undetected population of obscured AGN. Deep X-ray
surveys with Chandra and XMM will soon test this hypothesis. Similarly, recent
sub-mm surveys with SCUBA have revealed an analogous population of
exceptionally luminous, dust-enshrouded {\em star-forming} galaxies at high
redshift. There is now growing evidence for an intimate link between these
obscured populations. There are currently large uncertainties in the models,
but several independent arguments lead to the conclusion that a significant
fraction of the SCUBA sources ($10-30% $) will contain quasars. Recent
observational studies of SCUBA survey sources appear to confirm these
predictions, although the relative roles of AGN and star-forming activity in
heating the dust are unclear. Forthcoming surveys combining X-ray and sub-mm
observations will provide a very powerful tool for disentangling these
processes.

flows (ADAFs) fed by the evaporation of a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk (SSD).
In our picture the ADAF fills the central cavity evacuated by the SSD and
extends beyond the transition radius into a coronal region. We find that,
because of global angular momentum conservation, a significant fraction of the
hot gas flows away from the black hole forming a transsonic wind, unless the
injection rate depends only weakly on radius (if $r^2\dot\sigma\propto
r^{-\xi}$, $\xi< 1/2$). The Bernoulli number of the inflowing gas is negative
if the transition radius is $\lesssim 100$ Schwarzschild radii, so matter
falling into the hole is gravitationally bound. The ratio of inflowing to
outflowing mass is $\approx 1/2$, so in these solutions the accretion rate is
of the same order as in standard ADAFs and much larger than in
advection-dominated inflow/outflow models (ADIOS). The possible relevance of
evaporation-fed solutions to accretion flows in black hole X-ray binaries is
briefly discussed.

amplitude $ \Delta T/T \sim 1-3 \times 10^{-6}$ in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime.
The amplitude of the power spectrum strongly depends on the power spectrum
normalization and scales as $\sigma_8^{6-9}$. On smaller scales ($l>1000$) the
spectrum is dominated by halos below $10^{13}M_{\sun}$ and so is sensitive to
the thermal history of galactic halo gas. On larger scales ($l<1000$) the power
spectrum is less sensitive to nongravitational energy injection, but becomes
very noisy, with large field to field variations in the power spectrum caused
by rare bright sources in the maps, which dominate in the spectrum over the
large scale structure correlations. Cross-correlation power spectrum with weak
lensing or projected galaxy distribution is significant and the
cross-correlation coefficient is around 0.5 over a wide range of scales.
Comparison with Press-Schechter predictions gives very good agreement for all
the statistics, indicating that there is no significant contribution to SZ from
non-virialized structures. The one point distribution function shows clear

content of the universe finally converged at a consensus range of values which
indicates that at the present epoch the bulk of the universe's baryons is in
the form of a warm $\sim$ 10$^6$ K gas - a temperature regime which renders
them difficult to detect. The discovery of EUV and soft X-ray excess emission
from clusters of galaxies was originally interpreted as the first direct
evidence for the large scale presence of such a warm component. We present
results from an EUVE Deep Survey (DS) observation of the rich cluster Abell
2199 in the Lex/B (69 - 190 eV) filter passband. The soft excess radial trend
(SERT), shown by a plot against cluster radius $r$ of the percentage EUV
emission $\eta$ observed above the level expected from the hot intracluster
medium (ICM), reveals that $\eta$ is a simple function of $r$ which decreases
monotonically towards $r = 0$; it smoothly turns negative at $r \sim$ 6 arcmin,
inwards of this radius the EUV is absorbed by cold matter with a line-of-sight
column density of $\geq$ 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. The area of
absorption is much larger than that of the cooling flow. These facts together
provide strong evidence for a centrally concentrated but cluster-wide
distribution of clumps of cold gas which co-exist with warm gas of similar
spatial properties. Further, the simultaneous modeling of EUV and X-ray data
requires a warm component even within the region of absorption. The phenomenon
demonstrates a three phase ICM, with the warm phase estimated to be $\sim$ 5-10
times more massive than the hot.

soft X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies (first discovered in Virgo) are
two key contestants: the non-thermal scenario which postulates a population of
relativistic electrons undergoing inverse-Compton (IC) interaction with the
cosmic microwave background, and the original conjecture that the radiation is
from a thermal warm gas at a temperature of $\sim$ 10$^{5-6}$ K. Currently a
consensus set of limiting values on cosmological parameters favor the thermal
gas interpretation. We also argued, based on pressure balance within the
intracluster medium (ICM), that the non-thermal approach has formidable
difficulties. Here we describe a spatial analysis of the soft X-ray excess
emission of three clusters (Virgo, A2199, and Coma), using archival ROSAT/PSPC
data, which reveals resolved features of cold intracluster clouds in absorption
spreading over vast distances. Within the sample there is good indication that
the soft excess radial trend (SERT, which qualitatively means a rising
importance of the soft component with cluster radius) is due to a centrally
peaked distribution of cold matter, with Coma having the least effect and no
direct evidence for absorption. The data strongly suggest an intermixed ICM
which contains gas masses at a wide range of temperatures, and the soft excess
is due to a warm intermediate phase.

necessary for the excitation of radio waves. The time-scale of micropulses is
therefore determined by the wavelength of drift waves. Main features of the

apparently comprising the L1641-S3 CO outflow and the redshifted lobe of the
L1641-S CO outflow containing HH 65. This flow extends over at least 2.6 pc and
appears strongly curved. It is driven by L1641-S3 IRS, a deeply embedded 1.3 mm

become holons (charge Q=1, spin S_z=0), which can move along the stripe without
frustrating AF environment. One aspect in which the holons on the AF domain
wall differ from those in an ordinary one-dimensional electron gas is their
transverse degree of freedom: a mobile holon always resides on a transverse
kink (or antikink) of the domain wall. This gives rise to two holon flavors and

Hickman and Schmidt for water formation on Rh(111) with the important
difference that the OH molecule is significantly more stable than assumed by
Hickman and Schmidt. On Pt(111) surfaces, however, the calculations predict a
barrier to OH formation very similar to that found on Rh(111). In particular,
the calculated barrier to OH formation of about 20 kcal/mol seems to contradict
the small 2.5 kcal/mol barrier assumed in the Hickman-Schmidt scheme and the
observed large rate of water formation on Pt. A possible explanation for the
apparent discrepancy between the large calculated barrier for OH formation on
Pt and the experimentally observed rapid formation of water even at low
temperatures is that the active sites for water formation on Pt are at ""defect""
sites and not on the ideally flat terraces. A similar conclusion has been
reached by Verheij and Comsa, who did detailed experimental work on water
formation on Pt surfaces. Analyzing our results, we develop an explicit picture
of the interaction processes governing the formation of OH groups. This picture
rationalizes the calculated weak dependence of OH formation on substrate
material. An important conclusion from this work is that good catalysts for the
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons should resist defect formation at their
surfaces.

The relatively narrow lines observed at low temperatures suggest that disorder-

the cause of NFL behavior in these alloys: at low temperatures the experimental
values of delta chi(T)/chibar(T) are much smaller than required by disorder-
driven models. This is in contrast to results in at least some alloys with
disordered non-f-ion nearest neighbors to f ions (""ligand disorder""), where

self-consistently using the discrete variable representation, while the most
high-lying states are obtained with a local density approximation. Consistency
of the theory for temperatures through the Bose condensation point requires
that the thermodynamic chemical potential differ from the eigenvalue of the GP
equation; the appropriate modifications lead to results that are continuous as
a function of the particle interactions. The HFB equations are made gapless
either by invoking the Popov approximation or by renormalizing the particle
interactions. The latter approach effectively reduces the strength of the
effective scattering length, increases the number of condensate atoms at each
temperature, and raises the value of the transition temperature relative to the
Popov approximation. The renormalization effect increases approximately with
the log of the atom number, and is most pronounced at temperatures near the
transition. Comparisons with the results of quantum Monte Carlo calculations

contrasts with ""oscillator bath"" models (originated by Feynman and Vernon)

heavy quark is not destroyed, are discussed. The branching fractions for these
decays, corresponding to an absolute rate of order 0.01 ps^{-1}, should be at a
one percent level for the b hyperons and at a (few) per mill level for Xi_c,
possibly making feasible their experimental study in future. It is shown,
through an application of the heavy quark limit, the flavor SU(3) symmetry, and
PCAC, that the Delta I = 1/2 rule should hold very well in these decays, and
also that the Xi_b decays are purely S wave in the symmetry limit, while the
difference between the $S$ wave amplitudes of the Xi_c decays and those for the
Xi_b is related, in terms of the heavy quark expansion, to the difference of
the total decay rates within the (Xi_c, Lambda_c) triplet of charmed hyperons.
We also comment on the amplitudes of the semileptonic transitions Xi_Q ->
Lambda_Q l nu and on the weak radiative decays Xi_Q -> Lambda_Q gamma.

can drive parametric resonance instabilities. We discuss several phenomena
stemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically,
these involve energizing a resonant system so that it can evade tunneling by
crossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase
from a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an
asymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the
lower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be
driven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if
the upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation
models where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be
transferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions
over sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate
CP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate
of Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by
oscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients,
eventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples
numerically and to some extent analytically. The emphasis in the present paper
is on the generic mechanisms, and not on specific preheating models; these will
be discussed in a later paper.

Kaluza-Klein modes and we find that the four-dimensional gravitational mode is
localized precisely when the effects of the continuum modes decouple at
distances larger than the fundamental Planck scale. The decoupling is
contingent only on the long-range behaviour of the metric from the brane and we
find a universal form for the corrections to Newton's Law. We also comment on
the possible contribution of resonant modes. Given this, we find general
classes of metrics which maintain localized four-dimensional gravity. We find
that three-brane metrics in five dimensions can arise from a single scalar
field source, and we rederive the BPS type conditions without any a priori

the mode at the boundary. Additionally, the divergence of the vacuum energy
associated with a perfectly reflecting mirror is found to disappear for the
dielectric mirror at the expense of introducing a new energy density near the
surface which has the opposite sign. Thus the weak energy condition is always
violated in some region of the spacetime. For the dielectric mirror, the mean
vacuum energy density per unit plate area in a constant time hypersurface is
always found to be positive (or zero) and the averaged weak energy condition is
proven to hold for all observers with non-zero velocity along the normal

and $n>1$ the generalized Werner density matrix $W^{[ p^{n}]}(s) $ is fully
separable if and only if $s\leq (1+p^{n-1}) ^{-1}$.

quant-ph/9909025, deduces both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. It
does not only solve the problem of the arbitrariness on the operator ordering
for the quantization procedure, but also that of the analyticity at the exact
classical-limit of $\hbar =0 $. In addition, proto-mechanics proves valid also
for the description of a half-spin.
