  section re-written. Added missing point in Fig 4, Fig 5 changed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have used Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data to measure the lags between
soft (2-5 keV) and hard (5-13 keV) photons and to study the aperiodic
variability of the superluminal black hole candidate GRS 1915+105 during
low-flux states. The power density spectra exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPO) whose frequency increases with increasing count rate and varies in the
frequency range 0.6-8 Hz. A correlation between the QPO frequency and the phase
lag spectra is reported for the first time. This correlation is found for both
the phase lag continuum and the phase lag at the QPO frequency. We find that as
the QPO frequency moves to higher values the phase lags reverse sign from
positive to negative. The absolute value of the lag always increases with
photon energy. The negative (soft) lags are associated with a softer energy
spectrum, whereas the positive (hard) lags are seen when the source is harder.
We describe a possible scenario that may account for the change in the sign of
the lags.

neutron stars that produce Type I X-Ray bursts. I emphasize those observational
and theoretical aspects that should interest the broad audience of this
meeting. The easily accessible timescales of the bursts (durations of tens of
seconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringent
comparison to theory. The largest discrepancy (which was found with EXOSAT
observations) is the accretion rate dependence of the Type I burst properties.
Bursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rate
increases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. I present a
resolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of the
burning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretion
rate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases. This resurrects the
unsolved problem of knowing where the freshly accreted material accumulates on
the star, equally relevant to the likely signs of rotation during the bursts
summarized by Swank at this meeting. I close by highlighting the Type I bursts
from GS 1826-238 that were found with BeppoSAX and RXTE. Their energetics,
recurrence times and temporal profiles clearly indicate that hydrogen is being
burned during these bursts, most likely by the rapid-proton (rp) process.

neutron stars, Bildsten (1998) conjectured that their spin-up had been halted
by the emission of gravitational waves. He also pointed out that small
nonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to
""wavy"" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally
create a mass quadrupole moment.
  We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these
density perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces
Bildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust
by a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture
layers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range
as long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust. By
calculating the thermal flow throughout the core and the crust, we find that
temperature gradients this large are easily maintained by asymmetric heat
sources or lateral composition gradients in the crust.
  We also derive a general relation between the stresses and strains in the
crust and the maximum quadrupole moment they can generate. We show under quite
general conditions that maintaining a quadrupole of the magnitude necessary to
balance the accretion torque requires dimensionless strains close to 0.01 at
near-Eddington accretion rates, of order the breaking strain of conventional
materials.

Moreover the beat frequency in the Faraday rotation angle is determined mainly
by the Zeeman splitting, red shifted by the Coulomb scattering and the electron
hole spin exchange. Our numerical results are in agreement with experiment
findings. A possible scenario for the contribution of electron-hole spin
exchange to the spin dephasing of the $n$-doped material is also proposed.
