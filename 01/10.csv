paper describes in detail our simulation. To show the importance of the
distribution of matter in constraining WIMPZILLA characteristics, we consider
two extreme cases: a homogeneous universe, and a local halo with uniform
distribution. We show that in a homogeneous universe, the decay of UHDM with a
mass \sim 10^15 GeV and a lifetime \sim a few times \tau_0 the age of the
Universe, can not explain the flux of observed Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays
(UHECRs). This shows the importance of nearby sources, notably galactic halo.
In a uniform clump with an over-density of \sim 200 extended to 100 kpc or
more, the lifetime must be \sim 10 - 100 \tau_0 or the contribution in the DM
must be proportionally smaller. We also compare our calculation with observed
gamma-rays at E \sim 10^11 eV by EGRET and CASA-MIA limit at E \sim 10^15 eV.
They are compatible with a UHDM with relatively short lifetime.

luminosity of L >~ 5 L_*, while an analysis based on the redshift probability
distribution for the lensing galaxy argues against the existence of a z_lens >~
1 lens at the 2 sigma level. A similar analysis for a Lambda dominated

lensing galaxy. The broadband flux differences, spectral dissimilarities, and
failure to detect a lensing galaxy make the lensing hypothesis for CTQ 839
unlikely. The similar redshifts of the two components would then argue for a
physical quasar binary. At a projected separation of 8.3/h kpc (Omega_matter =

and dSph/dIrr) in the Local Group are associated with large reservoirs of
atomic gas, in some cases larger than the stellar mass. The gas is sometimes
found at large distance (~10 kpc) from the center of a galaxy and is not
necessarily centered on it. Similarly large quantities of ionized gas could be
hidden in these systems as well. The properties of some of the gas reservoirs
are similar to the median properties of the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs); two of
the HI reservoirs are catalogued HVCs. The association of the HI with the dwarf
spheroidals might thus provide a link between the HVCs and stars. We show that
the HI content of the Local Group dSphs and dIrrs exhibits a sharp decline if
the galaxy is within 250 kpc of either the Milky Way or M31. This can be
explained if both galaxies have a sufficiently massive x-ray emitting halo that
produces ram-pressure stripping if a dwarf ventures too close to either giant
spiral. We also investigate tidal stripping of the dwarf galaxies and find that
although it may play a role, it cannot explain the apparent total absence of
neutral gas in most dSph galaxies at distances less than 250 kpc. For the
derived mean density of the hot gas, n_0 = 2.5e-5 cm^-2, ram-pressure stripping
is found to be more than an order of magnitude more effective in removing the
gas from the dSph galaxies. The hot halo, with an inferred mass of 1e10 solar
masses, may represent a reservoir of ~1000 destroyed dwarf systems, either HVCs
or true dwarf galaxies similar to those we observe now.

found to be enhanced in all the stars. These results together with the nitrogen
abundances and oxygen isotope ratios measured by Lambert et al. (1986) and
Harris et al. (1987) are used to discuss the origin of J-stars. The luminosity

mass (M$\leq 2-3$ M$_\odot$), less evolved objects than the normal carbon
stars, although the presence of some luminous (M$_{bol}<-5.5$) J-stars in our

of at least two types of J-stars, with different formation scenarios depending
upon the initial mass of the parent star. Standard evolutionary AGB models are
difficult to reconcile with all the observed chemical characteristics. In fact,
they suggest the existence of an extra-mixing mechanism which transports
material from the convective envelope down to hotter regions where some nuclear
burning occurs. This mechanism would act preferably on the early-AGB phase in
low-mass stars. Mixing at the He-core flash and the binary system hypothesis
are also discussed as alternatives to the above scenario.

Analysis of the color-magnitude and period-color relations shows that globular

one candidate giant star. This apparent discrepancy can be resolved by assuming
either a significantly larger distance than suggested by several studies, or a
halo metallicity much lower than suggested by ground-based colors and as low as
metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. If previous distance and halo color
estimates for NGC 5907 are correct, our NICMOS results suggest that its

non-equilibrium OTP ratio in the region. The comparison between the OTP ratio

constant force can be calculated in a quasiclassical approximation by finding
the localized solutions (""bounces"") of the equations of classical dynamics in
imaginary time. We show that this theory is related to the critical cracks of
stressed solids, because the world lines of the atoms in the chain form a
two-dimensional crystal, and the bounce is a crack configuration in (unstable)
mechanical equilibrium. Thus the tunneling time, Action, and breaking rate in
the limit of small forces are determined by the classical results of Griffith.
For the limit of large forces we give an exact bounce solution that describes
the quantum fracture and classical crack close to the limit of mechanical
stability. This limit can be viewed as a critical phenomenon for which we
establish a Levanyuk-Ginzburg criterion of weakness of fluctuations, and
propose a scaling argument for the critical regime. The post-tunneling dynamics
is understood by the analytic continuation of the bounce solutions to real

(K&P), and Westerstahl (1998) criticize Zadrozny's (1994) argument that any
semantics can be represented compositionally. The argument is based upon
Zadrozny's theorem that every meaning function m can be encoded by a function
\mu such that (i) for any expression E of a specified language L, m(E) can be
recovered from \mu(E), and (ii) \mu is a homomorphism from the syntactic
structures of L to interpretations of L.
  In both cases, the primary motivation for the objections brought against
Zadrozny's argument is the view that his encoding of the original meaning
function does not properly reflect the synonymy relations posited for the
language.
  In this paper, we argue that these technical criticisms do not go through. In
particular, we prove that \mu properly encodes synonymy relations, i.e. if two
expressions are synonymous, then their compositional meanings are identical.
This corrects some misconceptions about the function \mu, e.g. Janssen (1997).
  We suggest that the reason that semanticists have been anxious to preserve
compositionality as a significant constraint on semantic theory is that it has
been mistakenly regarded as a condition that must be satisfied by any theory
that sustains a systematic connection between the meaning of an expression and
the meanings of its parts. Recent developments in formal and computational
semantics show that systematic theories of meanings need not be compositional.

proceed through a coloured $c\bar{c}$ state followed by the emission of soft

emission is usually a higher-order effect in the non-relativistic expansion,
but becomes important near the kinematic endpoint of quarkonium energy
(momentum) distributions. In an intermediate region a systematic resummation of
the non-relativistic expansion leads to the introduction of so-called `shape
functions'. In this paper we provide an implementation of the kinematic effect
of soft gluon emission which is consistent with the non-relativistic shape
function formalism in the region where it is applicable and which models the
extreme endpoint region. We then apply the model to photoproduction of $J/\psi$
and $J/\psi$ production in $B$ meson decay. A satisfactory description of $B$
decay data is obtained. For inelastic charmonium photoproduction we conclude
that a sensible comparison of theory with data requires a transverse momentum
cut larger than the currently used 1 GeV.

the 2-point and 3-point stress tensor correlators in flat background. At the

framework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approach
for physics beyond the standard model. The book begins with a brief review of
relativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, with
the emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.
The external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved
by introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time
which generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the
book is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ
methods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The
fermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational
principles in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational
principle is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many
similarities to the interactions of the standard model.
  The main chapters of the book are easily accessible for beginning graduate
students in mathematics or physics. Several appendices provide supplementary
material which will be useful to the experienced researcher.

explaining a lot of the detailed complexity observed in reality by a vastly
simpler description ``every possibility exists'' and a selection principle
({\em Anthropic Principle}) ``we only observe that which is consistent with our
existence''. In this paper I show why, in an ensemble theory of the universe,
we should be inhabiting one of the elements of that ensemble with least
information content that satisfies the anthropic principle. This explains the
effectiveness of aesthetic principles such as Occam's razor in predicting
usefulness of scientific theories. I also show, with a couple of reasonable
assumptions about the phenomenon of consciousness, the linear structure of
quantum mechanics can be derived.

both improve the computability for the relative entropy of entanglement and
avoid the problem that the entanglement of formation seems to be greater than
entanglement of distillation. For two qubit system we derive out an explicit
and ""weak"" closed expression of MRE that depends on the pure state
decompositions in the case of mixed states. For more qubit system, we obtain an
algorithm to calculate MRE in principle. MRE significantly improves the
computability of relative entropy of entanglement and decreases the dependence
and sensitivity on the pure state decompositions. Moreover it is able to
inherit most of the important physical features of the relative entropy of
entanglement. In addition, a kind of states, as an extension of Werner's
states, is discussed constructively.
