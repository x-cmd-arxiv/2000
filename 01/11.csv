5007 [O III] line of intracluster planetary nebulae in Virgo also probe high
redshift z=3.1 Ly alpha emitters. Here we report on the spectroscopic
identification of 9 Ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the FORS
spectrograph at Unit 1 of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT UT1). The spectra
of these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with
very faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent
width. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly alpha emitters are
quite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al.
(1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these
sources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly
optically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the
high observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star
formation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to
correspond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps
destined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving
volume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as
the star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break
galaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly alpha
emitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of star
forming regions at high redshifts. Finally, the Ly alpha emitters may
contribute as many H-ionizing photons as QSOs at z=3.

far described by four power law segments divided by three break frequencies
$\nu_{sa} < \nu_{c} < \nu_{m}$. This is valid for a homogeneous electron
distribution. However, hot electrons are located right after the shock, while
most electrons are farther down stream and have cooled. This spatial
distribution changes the optically thick part of the spectrum, introducing a
new break frequency, $\nu_{ac} < \nu_{sa}$, and a new spectral slope, $F_{\nu

forming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. Variability
was strongly correlated with the position on the branches. The broad band noise
became stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as the
spectrum became harder. Three types of QPOs were found: 1-18 Hz and 102-284 Hz
QPOs on the hard branches, and 16-18 Hz QPOs on and near the soft branch. The
frequencies of the high and low frequency QPOs on the hard branches were

where $z_c$ is the final collapse epoch. A cloud more massive than $M_{\rm SB}$
cools below $5\times 10^3$K due to H$_2$ line emission at the pancake collapse
and would undergo the initial starburst. The pancake possibly evolves into a
virialized system in a dissipationless fashion. Consequently, this leads to the
dissipationless galaxy formation at $3\lsim z_c \lsim 10$. A cloud less massive
than $M_{\rm SB}$ cannot cool by H$_2$ emission shortly after the pancake
collapse, but could cool in the course of shrinking to the rotation barrier.
This is likely to lead to the dissipational galaxy formation at relatively low
redshifts as $0\lsim z_c \lsim 4$. The present results provide a solid physical
mechanism which controls the star formation efficiency in the pregalactic

significantly contaminate the Galaxy with 19F. In their scenario, 19F is
synthesized at the beginning of the He-burning phase from the 14N left over by
the previous CNO-burning core, and is ejected in the interstellar medium when
the star enters its WC phase. Recourse to CNO seeds makes the 19F yields
metallicity-dependent. These yields are calculated on grounds of detailed
stellar evolutionary sequences for an extended range of initial masses (from 25
to 120 Msol) and metallicities (Z = 0.008, 0.02 and 0.04). The adopted mass
loss rate prescription enables to account for the observed variations of WR
populations in different environments. The 19F abundance in the WR winds of 60
Msol model stars is found to be about 10 to 70 times higher than its initial
value, depending on the metallicity. This prediction is used in conjunction
with a very simple model for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy to predict
that WR stars could be significant (dominant?) contributors to the solar system

is observed to be more abundant than Ni in the hot DA stars, is not detected,
the upper limit to its abundance (Fe/He$=10^{-6}$) implying a Fe/Ni ratio a
factor 10 lower than seen in the H-rich objects (Ni/He$=10^{-5}$ for
REJ0503$-$289). The abundance of nickel and various other elements heavier than
He were determined from GHRS spectra. We used two completely independent sets

reduces the possibility of systematic errors in our analysis but is also an
important consistency check for both model atmosphere codes.

fitting of the line profiles to a grid of model spectra, an analogue of the
standard procedure utilising the Balmer lines in DA white dwarfs. This gives
the assigned uncertainties in $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g a firm statistical basis

model gradients with those observed in the Hubble Deep Field. The models are
constructed so as to reproduce color gradients in local elliptical galaxies
either by a metallicity gradient or by an age gradient. By looking back a
sequence of color gradient as a function of redshift, the age - metallicity
degeneracy is solved. The observed color gradients in elliptical galaxies at
$z=0.1-1.0$ agree excellently with those predicted by the metallicity gradient,
while they deviates significantly from those predicted by the age gradient even
at $z \sim 0.3$ and the deviation is getting larger with increasing redshift.
This result does not depend on cosmological parameters and parameters for an
evolutionary model of galaxy within a reasonable range. Thus our results
clearly indicate that the origin of color gradients is not the age but the
stellar metallicity.

million model lightcurves, representing transits from planets with periods
ranging from 7 to 60 days, have been matched/correlated against these data.
This process we call the ""transit detection algorithm"" or TDA. The resulting
`transit-statistics' for each planet candidate allow the quantification of
detection probabilities, and of false alarm rates.
  Our current lightcurve of CM Dra has a coverage of 1014 hours with 26,043
individual points, at a photometric precision between 0.2% and 0.7%. Planets
significantly larger then 3Re would constitute a `supra-noise' detection, and
for periods of 60 days or less, they would have been detected with a
probability of 90%. `Subnoise' detections of smaller planets are more
constrained. For example, 2.5 Re planets with 10-day periods or less would have
been detected with an 80% probability. The necessity for predicted observations
is illustrated with the nine top planet candidates that emerged from our TDA
analysis. They are the planet candidates with the highest transit-statistics
from the 1994-1998 observing seasons and, for them, transits for the 1999
observing season were predicted. Of the seven candidates that were then
observationally tested in 1999, all were ruled out except one, which needs
further observational confirmation. We conclude that the photometric transit
method is a viable way to search for relatively small, inner extrasolar planets

line QSO as a function of redshift. The QSO stacked spectra, in the observers
0.1-2 keV band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1<z<3.2 apparently
harden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seen
in other QSO samples. In contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 keV band show no
significant variation in spectral index with redshift. This suggests the
presence of a spectral upturn at low energies (<0.5 keV). Indeed, while at high
redshifts (z>1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to the
data over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a second
component at low energies, a `soft excess'. Inclusion of a simple model for the
soft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kT~100 eV), results in a significant
improvement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for all
redshift bins. This power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, with
those of nearby AGN in the 2-10 keV band, suggesting that the same intrinsic
power-law slope may continue from 10 keV down to below 0.5 keV. We caution that
there is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent a
real physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a large
dispersion in spectral indices. Regardless of the origin of the soft excess,
the average QSO spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the X-ray
background: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift QSO are
significantly steeper than the spectrum of the X-ray background extending the
spectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 keV X-ray band.

the cyclotron absorption of radio waves in the magnetized pair plasma. This
explains self-consistently both the lack of apparent radio emission, at least

assumed underlying process from vanilla options alone must not be overly
restrictive, yet still unique, and relevant to all exotic options of interest.
For the implied tree we show that the calibration to real-world prices allows
us to only price vanilla options themselves correctly. This is usually
attributed to the incompleteness of the market under traditional stochastic
(local) volatility models. We show that some `weakly' stochastic volatility
models without quadratic variation of the volatilities avoid the incompleteness
problems, but they introduce arbitrage. More generally, we find that any

possibility of observing Z>137 bound states and transitions at the lower

orbiting protons will coalesce to form a nucleus (after beta-decay of some
protons to neutrons), with a stability curve different to that of free nuclei.

profile in the bulk. The resulting fermion masses and mixings are determined by
an exponentially suppressed overlap of the fermion and Higgs wave functions and
are automatically hierarchical even if all copies are identical and there is no

literally neighbors in the extra space. This picture may also provide a new way
of a hierarchically weak supersymmetry breaking, provided that the combination

$g_3^2=g_2^2=5/3 g_1^2$ has biased most attempts to embed the SM interactions
into a unified structure. After discussing the limitations of the orthodox
approach, we propose an alternative that appears to be quite naturally implied
by recent developments based on D-brane physics. In this new alternative: 1)
The gauge group, above a scale of order 1 TeV, is the minimal left-right
symmetric extension $SU(3)\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ of the
SM; 2) Quarks, leptons and Higgs fields come in three generations; 3) Couplings
unify at an intermediate string scale $M_s= 9\times 10^{11}$ GeV with boundary
conditions $g_3^2=g_L^2=g_R^2=32/3 g_{B-L}^2$. This corresponds to the natural
embedding of gauge interactions into D-branes and is different from the
standard SO(10) embedding which corresponds to $k_{B-L}=8/3$. Unification only
works in the case of three generations;
  4) Proton stability is automatic due to the presence of $Z_2$ discrete
R-parity and lepton parities. A specific Type IIB string orientifold model with
the above characteristics is constructed. The existence of three generations is
directly related to the existence of three complex extra dimensions.
  In this model the string scale can be identified with the intermediate scale
and SUSY is broken also at that scale due to the presence of anti-branes in the
vacuum.
  We discuss a number of phenomenological issues in this model including Yukawa
couplings and a built-in axion solution to the strong-CP problem. The present
framework could be tested by future accelerators by finding the left-right
symmetric extension of the SM at a scale of order 1 TeV.

phase transition to a colour deconfined state of matter - popularly called the
Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). In low energy effective theories of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), one usually talks of the chiral transition for which a
well defined order parameter exists. We investigate the dissociation of pions
and kaons in a medium of hot quark matter decsribed by the Nambu - Jona Lasinio
(NJL) model. The decay widths of pion and kaon are found to be large but finite
at temperature much higher than the critical temperature for the chiral (or
deconfinement) transition, the kaon decay width being much larger. Thus pions

impinging on cylindrical and spherical aluminium resonators. To monitor the
amplitude of the resonator's vibrational modes we used piezoelectric ceramic
sensors, calibrated by standard accelerometers. Calculations using the
thermo-acoustic conversion model, agree well with the experimental data, as
demonstrated by the specific variation of the excitation strengths with the
absorbed energy, and with the traversing particles' track positions. For the
first longitudinal mode of the cylindrical resonator we measured a conversion
factor of 7.4 +- 1.4 nm/J, confirming the model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the
spherical resonator, we found the model values for the L=2 and L=1 mode
amplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We thus have confirmed the
applicability of the model, and we note that calculations based on the model
have shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational wave detectors can
only be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if they will be
shielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can reduce the
background of remaining impinging cosmic rays effectively.

rather than antiunitary, with energy being a time vector changing sign under
time inversion. The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction,
is not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein
paradox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave
equation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case
of Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to
give energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear
number $Z>137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests
such as Zeeman effects. In non-relativistic limit, this nonlinear equation
reduces to nonlinear schr\""odinger equation with soliton-like solutions.
Moreover, particle conjugation and electron-proton scattering with a
nonsingular current-potential interaction are discussed. Finally the explicit
form of gauge function is found, the uniqueness of Lorentz gauge is proven and
the Lagrangian density of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is revised as well. The
implementation of unitary time inversion leads to the ultimate derivation of
nonlinear QED.

electromagnetic fields through nonminimal coupling. The Dirac--Pauli equation
for such a fermion coupled to a spherically symmetric or central electric field
can be reduced to two simultaneous ordinary differential equations by
separation of variables in spherical coordinates. For a wide variety of central
electric fields, bound-state solutions of critical energy values can be found
analytically. The degeneracy of these energy levels turns out to be numerably
infinite. This reveals the possibility of condensing infinitely many fermions
into a single energy level. For radially constant and radially linear electric
fields, the system of ordinary differential equations can be completely solved,
and all bound-state solutions are obtained in closed forms. The radially
constant field supports scattering solutions as well. For radially linear
fields, more energy levels (in addition to the critical one) are infinitely
degenerate. The simultaneous presence of central magnetic and electric fields
is discussed.

modes. We discuss the properties of the output atoms in the quasi-steady-state
where the population in the trap is not appreciably depleted. We show how the
composition of the output beam, containing condensate and thermal component,
may be controlled by changing the frequency of the output coupler. This
composition determines the first and second order coherence of the output beam.
We discuss the changes in the composition of the bose gas left in the trap and
show how nonresonant output coupling can stimulate either the evaporation of
thermal excitations in the trap or the growth of non-thermal excitations, when
pairs of correlated atoms leave the condensate.
