features attributable to the brightest stars in the central cluster, i.e.\
after background subtraction, W$_{\rm ^{12}CO(2-0)}$~$<$~2~\AA. This stringent
limit leads us to conclude that the majority, if not all, of the stars are
hotter than typical red giants. Coupled with previously reported photometry, we
conclude that the sources are likely OB main sequence stars. In addition, the
continuum slope in the composite spectrum is bluer than that of a red giant and
is similar to that of the nearby hot star, IRS16NW. It is unlikely that they
are late-type giants stripped of their outer envelopes because such sources
would be much fainter than those observed. Given their inferred youth
($\tau_{\rm age}$~$<$~20~\Myr), we suggest the possibility that the stars have
formed within 0.1 pc of the supermassive black hole. We find a newly-identified

emission of Cas A in the framework of a spatial inhomogeneous model, we
calculate the fluxes of gamma-radiation that can be expected from this
supernova remnant in different energy bands. We show that at energies below 10
GeV gamma-ray fluxes detectable by forthcoming space-borne detectors should be
produced due to bremsstrahlung of radio emitting electrons. We predict that the
power-law index of the photon flux in the GeV region should be hard, close to
the index ~2.2 expected for the acceleration spectrum of the electrons. Photon
fluxes accessible to future ground-based gamma-ray detectors could also be
expected at very high energies. The fluxes to be expected due to bremsstrahlung
and inverse Compton radiation of relativistic electrons at TeV energies should
be very steep, and strongly dependent on the characteristic magnetic fields in
Cas A. We could expect also significant fluxes of pi^0 -decay gamma-rays
produced by relativistic protons. These fluxes may extend with a hard spectrum
beyond TeV energies as far as the protons would be accelerated to energies
beyond 100 TeV. The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum at TeV energies could in
principle allow one to distinguish between electronic and hadronic origins of
those gamma-rays. We discuss also other implications, such as relativistic
particle content, or physical parameters in the source, that could be derived
from future gamma-ray flux measurements in different energy bands.

electrons in a spatially inhomogeneous medium in order to interpret the
broad-band nonthermal radiation of the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia
A. A two-zone model is proposed that distinguishes between compact, bright
steep-spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the one
hand, and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse `plateau' - on the other
hand. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the basic
features of the spectral and temporal evolution of the synchrotron radiation of
Cas A if one assumes that these compact structures correspond to sites of
efficient electron acceleration producing hard spectra of accelerated particles
with power-law indices ~2.2. The resulting energy distribution of radio
electrons in these compact structures becomes significantly steeper than the
electron production spectrum on timescales of the energy dependent escape of
these electrons into the surrounding diffuse plateau region. We argue that the
steepness, rather than the hardness, of the radio spectra of compact bright
structures in clumpy sources can in general be considered as a typical
signature of sites where strong electron acceleration has built up high
gradients in the spatial distribution of radio electrons. Subsequent diffusive
escape then modifies their energy distribution, leading to spatial variations
of spectral indices within the radio source. Qualitative and quantitative
interpretations of a number of observational data of Cas A are given.
Predictions following from the model are discussed.

decisive. These are the merging rates in compact groups, the properties of
remnants of multiple mergers, and the evolution of disc galaxies surrounded by
one or more satellites. The short dynamical times of compact groups make it
difficult to understand why such groups are observed at all. N-body simulations
have pointed out two possible classes of solutions to this problem. The first
one proposes that there is on-going formation of compact groups, or that the
longevity of the group is due to secondary infall. For the second class of
solutions the longevity of compact groups is due either to their specific
initial conditions, or to a massive common halo, encompassing the whole group.
I discuss here these alternatives, together with their respective advantages
and disadvantages. I then turn to the structure of remnants of multiple mergers
and compare the results of N-body simulations with the properties of observed
elliptical galaxies. Finally I discuss the dynamical evolution of a disc galaxy
surrounded by one or more spherical satellites.

particle physics cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a
natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark
substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response
function of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for
LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,
very low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation
effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. In
this review we study such a modulation effect in directional and undirectional
experiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates using
symmetric as well as asymmetric velocity distributions. We find that in the
symmetric case the modulation amplitude is small, less than 0.07. There exist,
however, regions of the phase space and experimental conditions such that the
effect can become larger. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced
velocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields the bonus of an
enhanced modulation effect, with an amplitude which for certain parameters can
become as large as 0.46.

campaign of five microlensing collaborations was unable to break this
degeneracy photometrically in the case of the binary lensing event MACHO

two image centroids are displaced from one another and this displacement is
detectable by observing the event at late times. Photometric degeneracies

nearby galaxies presented by Larsen & Richtler (1999) are used together with
literature data for 10 additional galaxies, spanning a range in specific U-band
luminosity T_L(U) from 0 to 15. We find that T_L(U) correlates with several
observable host galaxy parameters, in particular the ratio of Far-Infrared
(FIR) to B-band flux and the optical surface brightness. Taking the FIR
luminosity as an indicator of the star formation rate (SFR), it is found that
T_L(U) correlates very well with the SFR per unit area. A similar correlation
is seen between T_L(U) and the atomic hydrogen surface density. The cluster
formation efficiency seems to depend on the SFR in a continuous way, rather
than being related to any particularly violent mode of star formation. We
discuss fundamental features of possible scenarios for cluster formation. One
possibility is that the correlation between T_L(U) and SFR is due to a common
controlling parameter, most probably the density of the ISM. Another scenario
conceives a high T_L(U) as resulting from the energy input from many massive
stars in case of a high SFR.

that the magnification factor is ~100 from the restframe UV to mid-IR, where

value of alpha_cold (~ 0.005) do reproduce the long recurrence times and the
accretion rates at the level of the Eddington rate observed in outburst. The
large difference between the values of alpha_hot and alpha_cold, if confirmed
when disc irradiation is included, suggests that several viscosity mechanisms
operate in these accretion discs.
  For some choices of parameters our models predict reflares during the decline
from outburst. They are a physical property of the model and result from a
heating front forming in the wake of an initial cooling front and subsequent,
multiple front reflections. The reflares disappear in low-alpha models where
front reflection can not occur.

observed the Virgo sky region continuously for 7 weeks between December 10,
1996 and January 28, 1997. The prominent quasar 3C~273 was found to be the
brightest source in gamma-rays and was significantly detected by EGRET and
COMPTEL. The EGRET experiment observed a time-variable flux at energies above
100 MeV, which reached in a 2-week flaring period (December 30, 1996 to January
14, 1997) its highest flux level observed during the CGRO-era. COMPTEL,
however, does not observe obvious time variability at energies below ~30 MeV
contemporaneous to EGRET. In particular, no flare was observed, indicating that
this outburst is solely a high-energy (>100 MeV) phenomenon. The energy
spectrum between 3 MeV and 10 GeV is well represented by a simple power-law
model. Below 3 MeV a spectral turnover is indicated. Performing spectral
analysis for different time periods, we found evidence for a spectral hardening
during the flaring period, which is consistent with the flare occurring mainly
at the higher energies and with its absence at COMPTEL energies of a few MeV.
This may be interpreted as an indication that the emission in the EGRET energy
range is dominated by a different radiation mechanism than the MeV emission. We
argue that the most likely mechanism for the high-energy flare is
inverse-Compton scattering of reprocessed accretion-disk radiation.

galaxy-scale regular magnetic fields, which is surprising because of a lack of
ordered rotation required for the dynamo action. The strength of the regular
field reaches 8 $\mu$G and that of the total field 14 $\mu$G, comparable to
that of the total magnetic field strength in radio-bright spirals. The magnetic
vectors in NGC 4449 form radial ``fans'' in the central region and fragments of
a spiral pattern in the galaxy's outskirts. These structures are associated
with large regions of systematic Faraday rotation, implying genuine
galaxy-scale magnetic fields rather than random ones compressed and stretched
by gas flows. The observed pattern of polarization B-vectors is similar to
dynamo-type fields in normal spirals. Nonstandard, fast dynamo concepts are
required to explain the observed field strengths, though it is unknown what
kind of magnetic field geometry can be produced in slowly and chaotically
rotating objects. The so far neglected role of magnetic fields for the dynamics

were selected as presenting `linear' or cone-like high excitation emission line
in the optical, most probably due to the collimation of the central source's
radiation by a dusty molecular torus. Our goal was to look for signatures of
this torus, and to investigate the gaseous distribution, excitation and
reddening. The IR emission lines are spatially extended in most cases, and we
have used the [FeII]/Pa(beta) ratio as a measure of the gaseous excitation in
Mrk573, N1386, and N7582. Values for this ratio between 1.5 and 6 are found,
suggesting excitation of [FeII] by X-rays or shock waves in some regions.
Nuclear Pa(beta) in N1365, and possibly nuclear Br(gama) in Mrk573, are broad.
  From analysis of the spatial distribution of the continuum (J-H) and (H-K)
colours derived from our spectra, we find redder colours for the nucleus than
the nearby bulge in most of the Seyfert 2s observed. Comparison with models
including emission from dust and stars shows that hot (T~1000 K) dust emission
dominates the nuclear continuum in N1365, N2110, N3281, N7582, and ESO362-G18.
In N1386, N5643, and N5728 the main contributor is the underlying stellar
population, combined with some foreground reddening and/or cool dust emission.
In a few cases, the (J-H) colours on opposite sides of the nucleus differ by
0.3-0.8 mag, an effect that we interpret as partly due to differences in the
local stellar population, and possibly extinction gradients.

trace the dark matter density field, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest clouds being
undercorrelated and the bright galaxies overcorrelated, while the intermediate

which contain most of the stars only form a small fraction of the mass
associated with virialized and cooled halos. We consider two cosmologies: a
critical density universe and an open universe. In both cases, our results
agree with observations and show that hierarchical scenarios provide a good
model for structure formation and can describe a wide range of objects which
spans at least the seven orders of magnitude in mass for which data exist. More
detailed observations, in particular of the clustering evolution of galaxies,

lenticular (S0) galaxies, more luminous than MB=-17. When compared with

ellipticals follow a locus of fixed age and have metallicities varying roughly
from half solar to two times solar. The centres of (lower luminosity)
lenticular galaxies, however, exhibit a substantial spread to younger
luminosity-weighted ages indicating a more extended star formation history.
Galaxies with old stellar populations show tight scaling relations between
metal-line indices and the central velocity dispersion. Remarkably also the
Fe-lines are well correlated with sigma. Our detailed analysis of the stellar
populations suggests that these scaling relations are driven mostly by
metallicity. Galaxies with a young stellar component do generally deviate from
the main relation. In particular the lower luminosity S0s show a large spread.
Furthermore we find that elliptical galaxies and the bulge of one bright S0 are
overabundant in magnesium, where the most luminous galaxies show the strongest
overabundances. The stellar populations of young and faint S0s are consistent
with solar abundance ratios or a weak Mg underabundance. (abriged)

  transfer","Astronomy and Astrophysics - in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the 1996 outburst of the X-ray binary transient system GRO
J1655-40 can be explained by the standard dwarf-nova type disc instability,
followed by an episode of enhanced mass transfer from the secondary if the mass
transfer rate in GRO J1655-40 is within a factor < 10 of the stability limit.
We argue that irradiation of the secondary during the onset of the outburst
driven by the thermal instability in the outer disc can increase the mass
transfer rate above the minimum value required for stable accretion. This will
then produce the period of near-constant X-ray emission seen in this system.
This scenario can also explain the observed anti-correlation between the
optical and X-ray fluxes. It is generally accepted that optical emission in
low-mass X-ray binaries is produced by irradiation of the outer disc by X-rays.
There is also strong circumstantial evidence that in order for the outer disc
to see the irradiating flux, it must be warped. Depending on the warp
propagation mechanism, either a burst of mass from the secondary or viscous
decay are likely to decrease the degree of warping, thereby causing the
decrease in the observed optical flux while the X-ray flux remains constant or
even increases, exactly as observed in GRO J1655-40. Finally, the decrease of
the disc warping and, therefore, irradiation will cause the disc to become
unstable once again, terminating the outburst.

sensitive to this anisotropy. Recent theoretical predictions are discussed

interaction is treated by the Hartree-Fock approximation, and the localization
properties in the presence of disorder are studied by evaluating participation
ratios for the Hartree-Fock eigenfunctions. We show that the extended states
seem to exist only near each center of the two subbands split by the
exchange-enhanced energy gap. It is also shown that the self-consistent
orbitals whose energies are close to the Fermi energy appear to become extended
together with the reduction in the energy gap as the layer separation
increases. The collapse of the energy gap expected from our results is
consistent with the incompressible-compressible transition observed in recent
experiments, and the change of the localization properties near the Fermi
energy can explain the disappearance of the quantum Hall effect for large layer
separations very well.

`algebraically special frequency' $\Omega$, where these equations admit an
exact solution (elaborated here), generating the SUSY relationship between
them. The physical significance of the SUSY generator and of the solutions at
$\Omega$ in general is elucidated as follows. The RWE has no (quasinormal or
total-transmission) modes at all; however, $\Omega$ is nonetheless `special' in
that (a) for the outgoing wave into the horizon one has a `miraculous'
cancellation of a divergence expected due to the exponential potential tail,
and (b) the branch-cut discontinuity at $\omega=\Omega$ vanishes in the
outgoing wave to infinity. Moreover, (a) and (b) are related. For the ZE, its
only mode is the-inverse-SUSY generator, which is at the same time a
quasinormal mode_and_ a total-transmission mode propagating to infinity. The
subtlety of these findings (of general relevance for future study of the
equations on or near the negative imaginary $\omega$-axis) may help explain why
the situation has sometimes been controversial. For finite black-hole rotation,
the algebraically special modes are shown to be totally transmitting, and the
implied singular nature of the Schwarzschild limit is clarified. The analysis
draws on a recent detailed investigation of SUSY in open systems

mass to avoid the tunneling via the Hawking Moss solution and a small mass for
successful slow-rolling. However, Rubakov and Sibiryakov suggest that the
Hawking Moss solution is not a solution for the false vacuum decay process
since it does not satisfy the boundary condition. Hence, we have reconsidered
the arguments for the defect of the simple polynomial model. We find the valley
bounce belonging to a valley line in the functional space represents the decay
process instead of the Hawking Moss solution. The point is that the valley
bounce gives the appropriate initial condition for the inflation. We show an
open inflation model can be constructed within the polynomial form of the
potential so that the fluctuations can be reconciled with the observations.

Rejecting this attitude, I argue that one or more of the fundamental
""constants"" governing the quantum mechanics of atoms must depend upon position
in a gravitational field. A simple relationship governing the possible
dependencies of e, h, c and m is deduced, and arguments in favor of the choice
of the electron rest mass, m, are presented. The reduction of rest mass is thus
taken to be the sole cause of clock slowing. Importantly, this dependency
implies another effect, heretofore unsuspected, namely, the gravitational
elongation of measuring rods. An alternate (""telemetric"") system of measurement
is introduced, leading to a metric that is conformally related to the usual
proper metric. In terms of the new system, many otherwise puzzling phenomena
may be simply understood. In particular,the geometry of the Schwarzschild space
as described by the telemetric system differs profoundly from that described by
proper measurments, leading to a very different understanding of the structure
of black holes. The theory is extended to cosmology,leading to a remarkable
alternate view of the structure and history of the universe.

argue, however, that their definition of the number density does not correspond

model where the heavy particles carry a conserved U(1) charge, and the light
particles do not. The fluctuations of the net charge in a given volume then
provide a measure of the total number of heavy particles in that same volume.

computation of the second symbolic power $\bar I^{(2)}$ of an ideal $\bar I$ in
the residue ring $R/H$ of a polynomial ring $R$ over a field of characteristic
zero. The torsion part $T(M)$ of $M$ and the torsion free module $M/T(M)$ are
expressed by the primitive ideal of $I$ relative to $H$. Two characterizations
for $M/T(M)$ to be free are proved. Some immediate applications are worked out.

model boundary-driven transport, when the driving is applied by a
``perturbation'' of the dynamics localised in a macroscopically small region.
In this case there are sustained density gradients in the steady state. A
non-uniform stationary temperature profile can be maintained by incorporating a
heat source into the dynamics, which deviates from the one of a bulk system
only in a (macroscopically small) localized region such that a heat (or
entropy) flux can enter an attached thermostat only in that region. For these
settings the relation between the average phase-space contraction, the entropy
flux to the thermostat and irreversible entropy production is clarified for
stationary and non-stationary states. In addition, thermoelectric cross-effects
are described by a multibaker chain consisting of two parts with different
transport properties, modelling a junction between two metals.

convergence of the onset point of the period 2^m solution to the accumulation
point is exponentially fast. We reported these results previously. In this

we study the period doubling cascade starting from period p solution and show

with an infinite or a limited frequency band is analyzed. The evanescent wave
is characterized by a forerunner (transient) related to the precise way the
source is switched on. It is followed by an asymptotic, monochromatic wave
which at long times reveals the oscillation frequency of the source. For a
source with a sharp onset the forerunner is exponentially larger than the
monochromatic solution and a transition from the transient regime to the
asymtotic regime occurs only at asymptotically large times. In this case, the
traversal time for tunneling plays already a role only in the transient regime.
To enhance the monochromatic solution compared to the forerunner we investigate
(a) frequency band limited sources and (b) the short time Fourier analysis (the
spectrogram) corresponding to a detector which is frequency band limited.
Neither of these two methods leads to a precise determination of the traversal
time. However, if they are limited to determine the traversal time only with a
precision of the traversal time itself both methods are successful: In this
case the transient behavior of the evanescent waves is at a time of the order
of the traversal time followed by a monochromatic wave which reveals the
frequency of the source.
