A powerful beamed
pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a cusp produces a jet of accelerated
particles, whose propagation is terminated by the shock responsible for GRB. A
single free parameter, the string scale of symmetry breaking $\eta \sim 10^{14}
GeV$, together with reasonable assumptions about the magnitude of cosmic
magnetic fields and the fraction of volume that they occupy, explains the GRB
rate, duration and fluence, as well as the observed ranges of these quantities.
The wiggles on the string can drive the short-time structures of GRB. This
model predicts that GRBs are accompanied by strong bursts of gravitational
radiation which should be detectable by LIGO, VIRGO and LISA detectors.

Way in terms of a model of superposition 2- and 4-armed wave harmonics (the
simplest description, besides pure modes). Two complementary methods are used:
a study of stellar kinematics, and direct tracing of positions of spiral arms.
In the first method, the parameters of the galactic rotation curve and the free
parameters of the spiral density waves were obtained from Cepheid kinematics,
under different assumptions. To turn visible the structure corresponding to
these models, we computed the evolution of an ensemble of N-particles,
simulating the ISM clouds, in the perturbed galactic gravitational field. In
the second method, we present a new analysis of the longitude-velocity (l-v)
diagram of the sample of galactic HII regions, converting positions of spiral
arms in the galactic plane into locii of these arms in the l-v diagram. Both
methods indicate that the ``self-sustained'' model, in which the 2-armed and
4-armed mode have different pitch angles (6 arcdeg and 12 arcdeg, respectively)
is a good description of the disk structure. An important conclusion is that
the Sun happens to be practically at the corotation circle. As an additional
result of our study, we propose an independent test for localization of the
corotation circle in a spiral galaxy: a gap in the radial distribution of
interstellar gas has to be observed in the corotation region.

(SFR) for the sample of 34 spiral galaxies. To adjust SFR values, obtained from
different indicators, we considered the slope $\alpha$ and/or upper mass limit
$M_{up}$ of Initial Mass Function (IMF) as free parameters. The best agreement
between these indicators reaches for $M_{up} \approx 60 - 100 ~M_{\odot}$ and
$\alpha \approx -3.1 $ in the high mass end of IMF ($M > 10 ~M_{\odot}$).
Parallel with SFR we also estimated FIR excess $X_{FIR}$ defined as a fraction
of the observed FIR which is not related to young massive stars directly.
$X_{FIR}$ is found to be well correlated with types of spiral galaxies and
their colors (B-V): the redder a galaxy the higher is its FIR excess. We
conclude that for any parameters of IMF the observed FIR flux of early type
spiral galaxies needs the additional source of energy but the massive star
radiation.

histories, for a Lambda CDM model, were generated and used to calculate the
virialization of dark matter (DM) haloes. A diversity of halo density profiles
were obtained, the most typical one being close to the NFW profile. We modeled
the formation of discs in centrifugal equilibrium within the evolving DM haloes
using gas accretion rates proportional to the halo mass aggregation rates, and
assuming detailed angular momentum conservation. We calculated the
gravitational interactions between halo and disc, and the hydrodynamics, star
formation, and evolution of the galaxy discs. We found that the slope and
zero-point of the infrared Tully-Fisher relations (TFR) may be explained as a
direct consequence of the cosmological initial conditions. This relation is
almost independent of the assumed disc mass fraction. The rms scatter of the
TFR originates mainly from the scatter in the DM halo structure and, to a minor
extension, from the dispersion of the primordial spin parameter. The scatter
obtained does not disagree with the observational estimates. Our models allow
us to understand why the residuals of the TFR do not correlate significantly
with disc size or surface brightness (SB), and why low and high SB galaxies
have the same TFR. The correlations between gas fraction and SB, and between
scale length and V_max agree with those observed. The discs present nearly
exponential SB distributions. The shape of the rotation curves changes with the
SB and is nearly flat for most cases. The rotation curve decompositions show a
dominance of DM down to very small radii. The introduction of shallow cores in
the DM halo attenuates this difficulty.

II) progenitors, with a lower mass limit of Mms = 20 Msun, a unique feature in
the observed distribution of [Ba/Mg] vs.[Mg/H] for extremely metal-poor stars
can be adequately reproduced. We associate this feature, a bifurcation of the
observed elemental ratios into two branches in the Mg abundance interval -2.7 <
[Mg/H] < -2.3, with two distinct processes. The first branch, which we call the
``y''-branch, is associated with the production of Ba and Mg from individual
massive supernovae. We conclude that SNe II with Mms = 20 Msun are the dominant
source of r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Galaxy. An SN-induced chemical
evolution model with this Mms-dependent Ba yield creates the y-branch,
reflecting the different nucleosynthesis yields of [Ba/Mg] for each SN II with
Mms > 20 Msun. The second branch, which we call the ``i''-branch, is associated
with the elemental abundance ratios of stars which were formed in the dense
shells of the interstellar medium swept up by SNe II with Mms < 20 Msun that do
not synthesize r-process elements, and applies to stars with observed Mg
abundances in the range [Mg/H] < -2.7. The Ba abundances in these stars reflect
those of the interstellar gas at the (later) time of their formation. The
existence of a [Ba/Mg] i-branch strongly suggests that SNe II which are
associated with stars of progenitor mass Mms < 20 Msun are infertile sources
for the production of r-process elements. We predict the existence of this
i-branch for other r-process elements, such as europium (Eu), to the extent
that their production site is in common with Ba.

pixelization for reversion, namely, for the pixelization that -after reversion-

scales. Squared pixels having different sizes ""smaller"" than the beam radius

we assign a temperature to each pixel? Various mathematical methods are used to
show that, in practice, this assignation -beam reversion or deconvolution- only
leads to right spectra for pixel sizes greater than a certain lower limit close

relevant levels of noise and also for spherically symmetric and asymmetric
beams. After this general study, we focus our attention on two feasible
detectors (which have been proposed to be on board of PLANCK satellite). For

1+1 dimensions accounting for the anharmonicity and non-convexity of the real
interatomic forces. It is shown that coherent 3D islands can be expected to
form in compressed rather than in expanded overlayers beyond a critical lattice
misfit. In the latter case the classical Stranski-Krastanov growth is expected
to occur because the misfit dislocations can become energetically favored at
smaller island sizes. The thermodynamic reason for coherent 3D islanding is the
incomplete wetting owing to the weaker adhesion of the edge atoms. Monolayer
height islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors of the 3D
islands. The latter explains the experimentally observed narrow size
distribution of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation takes place by
consecutive rearrangements of mono- to bilayer, bi- to trilayer islands, etc.,
after exceeding the corresponding critical sizes. The rearrangements are
initiated by nucleation events each next one requiring to overcome a lower
energetic barrier. The model is in good qualitative agreement with available
experimental observations.

It is shown that the universal beta-relaxation-scaling laws, dealing with the

dependence analysis is that it examines only the memory locations read and

enables a wider set of transformations to be used, and is critical for
optimizing important codes such as LU factorization with pivoting.

Such an observation could be used to distinguish the new physics effects from
different mode ls. For instance, the top quark two-Higgs doublet model can be
easily separated from those models without new phase in B-decay amplitudes, and
can be further distinguished from the most general two Higgs doublet model by
its absence of new phase in the $B^0-\bar{B}^0$ mixing.

cells. In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the
same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons.
The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct
electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each
realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide
here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave
similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined
bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization. We report
briefly on an experiment on coupled biological neurons and four dimensional ENs
which provides further ground for testing the validity of our numerical and
electronic models of individual neural behavior. Our experiments as a whole
present interesting new examples of regularization and synchronization in
coupled nonlinear oscillators.

area-preserving Baker map. Semiclassical periodic orbit formulae together with
universal spectral statistics in the corresponding quantum Baker map suggest
the existence of universal periodic orbit correlations. The calculation of
periodic orbit sums for the Baker map can be performed with the help of a
Perron-Frobenius type operator. This makes it possible to study periodic orbit
correlations for orbits with period up to 500 iterations of the map. Periodic
orbit correlations are found to agree quantitatively with the predictions from
random matrix theory up to a critical length determined by the semiclassical
error. Exponentially increasing terms dominate the correlations for longer
orbits which are due to the violation of unitarity in the semiclassical
approximation.

periodic orbit degeneracy classes. A special class of graphs, so-called binary
graphs, is studied in more detail. For these, the conditions for periodic orbit
pairs to be correlated (including correlations due to the unitarity of the
transfer matrix) can be given explicitly. Using combinatorial techniques it is
possible to perform the summation over correlated periodic orbit pair
contributions to the form factor for some low--dimensional cases. Gradual
convergence towards random matrix results is observed when increasing the

  at University of New England, 16 November 1999",,,,"physics.hist-ph physics.soc-ph",,"  Until this century, the number of working female scientists has been
indeterminate. Prevailing wisdom indicates that women, historically, have not
excelled in the mathematics and sciences, for various reasons. These range from
societal pressures to marry and bear children, to a lack of systematic
scientific education for females, to the lack of opportunity in institutions
and industry. Women, until comparatively recently, were not in control of their
own financial lives, and were therefore dependent upon the goodwill of a
husband, father or brother, should they attempt to enter academic life. Many
times, their accomplishments, and the accomplishments of these collaborating
relatives, become so merged as to become indistinguishable. Nevertheless, with
all these factors working against them, history records an occasional bright
star. Their diaries, memoirs and correspondence detail both the similarities
and the differences between their roles and the roles of modern female
scientists, in their own minds, and in the estimation of those closest to them.
There exists, in science, a dichotomy between the desire to understand one's
universe, and the desire to change the understanding of others. These two
fundamental desires lead future scientists to the discipline. Historically, the
role of women has largely been interpretive, rather than innovative, by their
own estimation. But is interpretation the ""natural"" role of women scientists?

electrons in Ge, by a more detailed analysis of more accurate data than
