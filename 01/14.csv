late-type and 59 early-type WN stars, log L(HeII)=36.0 erg/s and 35.8 erg/s

  Synthetic WN models are calculated with identical parameters except that
metal abundances are varied. Following the Smith et al. WN classification
scheme, CNO equilibrium models reveal that earlier spectral types are predicted
at lower metallicity, i.e. WN3--4 at 0.04 Z(solar) versus WN6 at 1.0 Z(solar).
This provides an explanation for the trend towards earlier WN spectral types at

abundance accuracy of 0.033 dex per star. The work shows that the intrinsic
spread of the Li abundances of these stars at a given metallicity is <0.02 dex,
and consistent with zero. That is, the Spite Li plateau for halo field dwarfs
is incredibly thin. The thinness rules out depletion by more than 0.1 dex by a
rotational-induced extra-mixing mechanism. Despite the thinness of the plateau,
an increase of Li with [Fe/H] is seen, interpreted as evidence of Galactic
chemical evolution (GCE) of Li, primarily due to Galactic cosmic ray (GCR)
spallation reactions in the era of halo formation. The rate of Li evolution is
concordant with: (1) observations of spallative 6Li in halo dwarfs; (2) GCE
models; and (3) data on Li in higher metallicity halo stars. New data have also
revealed four new ultra-Li-deficient halo dwarfs, doubling the number known.
Based on their propensity to cluster at the halo main sequence turnoff and also
to exist redward of the turnoff, we hypothesise that they are the products of
binary mergers that ultimately will become blue stragglers. We explain their
low Li abundances by normal pre-main-sequence (and possibly main-sequence)
destruction in the low mass stars prior to their merging. If this explanation
is correct, then such stars need no longer be considered an embarrassment to
the existence of negligible Li destruction in the majority of field halo
dwarfs.

millimeter continuum photometry of a sample of 30 IRAS sources previously
studied in molecular lines and centimeter radio continuum. All the sources have
IRAS colours typical of very young stellar objects (YSOs) and are associated
with dense gas. In spite of their high luminosities (L>10000 solar units), only
ten of these sources are also associated with a radio counterpart. In 17 cases
we could identify a clear peak of millimeter emission associated with the IRAS
source, while in 9 sources the millimeter emission was extended or faint and a
clear peak could not be identified; upper limits were found in 4 cases only.
  Using simple greybody fitting model to the observed SED, we derive global
properties of the circumstellar dust. The dust temperature varies from 24 K to
45 K, while the exponent of the dust emissivity vs frequency power-law spans a
range 1.56<beta<2.38, characteristic of silicate dust; total circumstellar
masses range up to more than 500 solar masses.
  We find that for sources with comparable luminosities, the total column
densities derived from the dust masses do not distinguish between sources with
and without radio counterpart. We interpret this result as an indication that
dust does not play a dominant role in inhibiting the formation of the HII
region. We examine several scenarios for their origin in terms of newborn ZAMS
stars and although most of these fail to explain the observations, we cannot
exclude that these sources are young stars already on the ZAMS with modest
residual accretion that quenches the expansion of the HII region. Finally, we
consider the possibility that the IRAS sources are high-mass pre-ZAMS (or
pre-H-burning) objects deriving most of the emitted luminosity from accretion.

potential to populate the universe with relic magnetic monopoles. Observations
of galactic magnetic fields, as well as observations matched with models for
extragalactic magnetic fields, lead to the conclusion that monopoles of mass
$\lsim 10^{15}$ GeV are accelerated in these fields to relativistic velocities.
We explore the possible signatures of a cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles
impinging on the earth. The electromagnetically-induced signatures of monopoles
are reliable. The hadronically-induced signatures are highly model-dependent.
Among our findings are (i) the electromagnetic energy losses of monopoles
continuously initiate a protracted shower of small intensity; (ii) monopoles
may traverse the earth's diameter, making them a probe of the earth's interior
structure; (iii) in addition to the direct monopole Cherenkov signal presently
employed, a very attractive search strategy for monopoles is detection of their
radio-Cherenkov signal produced by the coherent charge-excess in the $e^+-e^-$
shower - in fact, Cherenkov-detectors have the potential to discover a monopole
flux (or limit it) several orders of magnitude below the theoretical Parker
limit of $10^{-15}/\rm{cm}^2$/s/sr; (iv) it is conceivable (but not compelling)
that bound states of colored monopoles may be the primary particles initiating

electrons (similar to those advocated by the ADAF or ADIOS flows) and the
stochastic nature of Compton scattering which converts these soft photons into
the observed high energy radiation. Thus, the timing properties (PSD, lags,

of the scattering medium (which in this approximation acts as a combination of

most notably the density profile of the scattering medium. The model accounts
well for the observed PSDs and lags and also the reduction in the RMS

Milky Way arises due to a modification of the primordial power spectrum of
fluctuations from inflation. Such modifications would be expected to alter the
formation of structure from bottom-up to top-down on scales near where the
short-scale power has been suppressed. Using cosmological simulations we study
the effects of such a modification of the initial power spectrum. While the
halo multiplicity function depends primarily on the linear theory power
spectrum, most other probes of power are more sensitive to the non-linear power
spectrum. Collapse of large-scale structures as they go non-linear regenerates
a ``tail'' in the power spectrum, masking small-scale modifications to the
primordial power spectrum except at very high-z. Even the small-scale
(k>2h/Mpc) clustering of the Ly-alpha forest is affected by this process, so
that CDM models with sufficient power suppression to reduce the number of 10^10
Msun halos by a factor of about 5 give similar Ly-alpha forest power spectrum
results. We conclude that other observations that depend more directly on the
number density of collapsed objects, such as the number of damped Ly-alpha
systems, or the redshift of reionization may provide the most sensitive tests
of these models.

Observed spiral galaxies are spread on a plane in the
three-dimensionallogarithmic space of luminosity L, radius R and rotation
velocity V. The plane is expressed as $L \propto (V R)^{\alpha}$ in I-passband,
where $\alpha$ is a constant. On the plane, observed galaxies are distributed
in an elongated region which looks like the shape of a surfboard. The
well-known scaling relations, L-V (Tully-Fisher relation), V-R (also the
Tully-Fisher relation) and R-L (Freeman's law), can be understood as oblique
projections of the surfboard-like plane into 2-D spaces. This unified
interpretation of the known scaling relations should be a clue to understand
the physical origin of all the relations consistently. Furthermore, this
interpretation can also explain why previous studies could not find any
correlation between TF residuals and radius.
  In order to clarify the origin of this plane, we simulate formation and
evolution of spiral galaxies with the N-body/SPH method, including cooling,
star formation and stellar feedback. Initial conditions are set to isolated 14
spheres with two free parameters, such as mass and angular momentum. The CDM
(h=0.5, $\Omega_0=1$) cosmology is considered as a test case. The simulations
provide the following two conclusions: (a) The slope of the plane is well
reproduced but the zero-point is not. This zero-point discrepancy could be
solved in a low density ($\Omega_0<1$) and high expansion (h>0.5) cosmology.
(b) The surfboard-shaped plane can be explained by the control of galactic mass
and angular momentum.

accompanied by a critical temperature $T_c(\Phi)$, showing a smooth transition

minimal model, the nearness of the t quark Landau pole naturally suppresses the
t-quark cubic soft breaking parameter at the electroweak scale allowing the

be satisfied with a large GUT scale phase. However, the EDM constraints require
that $\theta_B$, the quadratic soft breaking parameter phase be small at the

at the GUT scale this phase must be large and highly fine tuned to satisfy
radiative breaking of $SU(2)\times U(1)$. Similar results hold for non minimal

condensates along flat directions of the supersymmetric standard model, which
attained large vevs at the end of inflationary epoque. The key observation is
that superpotential interactions couple the flat directions to other fields,
which acquire masses induced by the flat-direction vev that may be sufficiently
small for them to be kinematically accessible to inflaton decay. The resulting
plasma of inflaton decay products then may act on the flat directions via these
superpotential Yukawa couplings, inducing thermal masses and
supersymmetry-breaking A terms. In such cases the flat directions start their
oscillations at an earlier time than usually estimated. The oscillations are
also terminated earlier, due to evaporation of the flat direction condensate
produced by its interaction with the plasma of inflaton decay products. In
these cases we find that estimates for the resulting baryon/lepton asymmetry of
the universe are substantially altered. We identify scenarios for the Yukawa
couplings to the flat directions, and the order and mass scale of
higher-dimensional superpotential interactions that set the initial flat
direction vev, that might lead to acceptable baryo/leptogenesis.

mass degeneracy between the two mass eigenstates most coupled to the $\nu_\mu$

degeneracy and induce an effectively maximal mixing between these two
generations. This occurs if $\nu_e$'s contain comparable admixtures of the
degenerate eigenstates, even rather small ones. This provides an explanation of
the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in which the {\it ab initio} introduction of a
large mixing angle is not required. To test this possibility we perform a novel
and detailed analysis of the 52 kiloton-year SuperKamiokande data, and we find
that in a large region of parameter space the corresponding confidence levels
are excellent. The most recent results from the Chooz reactor experiment,
however, severely curtail this region, so that the conventional scenario with

oscillation from ingoing modes. A short distance cutoff on degrees of freedom
is incompatible with local Lorentz invariance, but may nevertheless be

to relate the equations of Boltzmann and Vlasov to the dynamics of
many-particle systems. Propagation of chaos means that molecular chaos, i.e.,
the stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system,
persists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.
  We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general
n-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in
terms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle
processes, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states
propagates if it propagates for pure initial states.
  Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study
of chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka. We assume that the space in which the
particles live is homeomorphic to a complete and separable metric space so that
we may invoke Prohorov's theorem in our proof.
  We also show that, if the particles can be in only finitely many states, then
molecular chaos implies that the specific entropies in the n-particle
distributions converge to the entropy of the limiting single-particle
distribution.

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is used as an example to show how holistic finite
differences may be applied to fourth order, nonlinear, spatio-temporal
dynamical systems. This novel centre manifold approach is holistic in the sense
that it treats the dynamical equations as a whole, not just as the sum of
separate terms.

that the differences of transverse components of velocity field are well
described by a gaussian statistics and Kolmogorov scaling exponents. In this
case the dissipation fluctuations are irrelevant in the limit of small
viscosity. In general, one can assume existence of critical
space-dimensionality $d=d_{c}$, at which the energy flux and all odd-order
moments of velocity difference change sign and the dissipation fluctuations
become dynamically unimportant. At $d<d_{c}$ the flow can be described by the
``mean-field theory'', leading to the observed gaussian statistics and
Kolmogorov scaling of transverse velocity differences. It is shown that in the
vicinity of $d=d_{c}$ the ratio of the relaxation and translation
characteristic times decreases to zero, thus giving rise to a small parameter
of the theory. The expressions for pressure and dissipation contributions to
the exact equation for the generating function of transverse velocity
differences are derived in the vicinity of $d=d_{c}$. The resulting equation
describes experimental data on two-dimensional turbulence and demonstrate onset
of intermittency as $d-d_{c}>0$ and $r/L\to 0$ in three-dimensional flows in
close agreement with experimental data. In addition, some new exact relations
between correlation functions of velocity differences are derived. It is also
predicted that the single-point pdf of transverse velocity difference in
developing as well as in the large-scale stabilized two-dimensional turbulence
is a gaussian.

system in two physically relevant parameters exhibits a rich variety of
dynamical behaviour, including period bubbling and period adding or Farey
sequences. The complex bifurcation sequences, characterized by Mixed Mode
Oscillations, exhibit partial features of Shilnikov and Gavrilov-Shilnikov
scenario. Utilizing the fact that the model has disparate time scales of
dynamics, we explain the origin of the relaxation oscillations using the
geometrical structure of the bent-slow manifold. Based on a local analysis, we
calculate the maximum number of small amplitude oscillations, $s$, in the
periodic orbit of $L^s$ type, for a given value of the control parameter. This
further leads to a scaling relation for the small amplitude oscillations. The
incomplete approach to homoclinicity is shown to be a result of the finite rate
of `softening' of the eigen values of the saddle focus fixed point. The latter
is a consequence of the physically relevant constraint of the system which
translates into the occurrence of back-to-back Hopf bifurcation.

of this more 'conventional' approach in comparison to experimental data should
indicate the presence of a different phase which might be either attributed to

to the presence of a QGP phase with strongly interacting partons. We study the

collisions as a function of the bombarding energy and present predictions for
these observables as well as hadron rapiditiy distributions at RHIC energies.
Whereas all observables studied within HSD show smooth increasing/decreasing
excitation functions, the experimental $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio indicates a maximum at

with the former. Both general relativity and nonlinear dynamics inform us that
