  Kinematic Signature of Mergers?","Latex, 5 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1086/312532",,"astro-ph",,"  We present evidence for non-Gaussian velocity fields within the cores of
luminous elliptical galaxies. This evidence is based upon high signal-to-noise,
medium-resolution spectroscopy of the cores of early-type members of the Virgo
and Coma clusters obtained with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. The Virgo data were
acquired using an integral-field unit (DensePak) allowing the velocity field to
be sampled over a variety of spatial scales. The Coma data were obtained
through single, 2-arcsec diameter fibers. The cross-correlation profiles of
luminous ellipticals show considerable structure, often having several features
with amplitudes as high as 10% that of the cross-correlation peak itself. This
structure is most obvious within a radius of 1.5 arcsec (at Virgo), or < 100
pc, and is nearly undetectable when the data are binned over R < 15 arcsec, or
< 1 kpc. Similar features are found in the single-fiber spectra of the luminous
ellipticals in the Coma Cluster suggesting they are ubiquitous to giant
ellipticals. Interesting, only the most luminous elliptical galaxies show this
phenomena; the central regions of lower luminosity ellipticals have regular,
Gaussian-like profiles. We interpret this kinematic structure as ``stellar
streaming'' and suggest that this phenomena could be a relic signature of the
merger history of luminous elliptical galaxies.

impulsive phase of a flare. The properties of the excited waves and the
thresholds for instability are investigated by using linearized kinetic theory.
These thresholds were connected to the pre-flare plasma parameters by assuming
an acceleration model acting exclusively in parallel direction. For usually
assumed pre-flare plasma conditions the electrons become unstable during the
acceleration process and lefthand circularly polarized waves with frequencies
of about the proton gyrofrequency are excited at parallel propagation.
Indications have been found, that the largest growth rates occur at oblique

obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the European Southern

than those of A223, with bi-weighted mean velocity of V_{bi} = 64242 +/- 194

changes in morphology of the red giant branch (RGB) of Galactic globular
clusters (GGC) as a function of metallicity, in the V,I bands. To this aim, two
key points are developed in the course of the analysis.
  (a) Using our photometric V,I database for Galactic globular clusters (the
largest homogeneous data sample to date; Rosenberg et al. 1999) we measure a
complete set of metallicity indices, based on the morphology and position of
the red-giant branch. In particular, we provide here the first calibration of
the S, DV_(1.1) and DV_(1.4) indices in the (V-I,V) plane. We show that our
indices are internally consistent, and we calibrate each index in terms of
metallicity, both on the Zinn & West (1984) and the Carretta & Gratton (1997)
scales. Our new calibrations of the (V-I)o,g, DV_(1.2), (V-I)_(-3.0) and
(V-I)_(-3.5) indices are consistent with existing relations.
  (b) Using a grid of selected RGB fiducial points, we define a function in the
{(V-I)o,Mi,[Fe/H]} space which is able to reproduce the whole set of GGC giant
branches in terms of a single parameter (the metallicity). As a first test, we
show that the function is able to predict the correct trend of our observed
indices with metallicity.
  The usage of this function will improve the current determinations of
metallicity and distances within the Local Group, since it allows to easily map
[(V-I)o,Mi] coordinates into {[Fe/H],Mi} ones. To this aim the ``synthetic''
RGB distribution is generated both for the currently used Lee et al. (1990)
distance scale, and for the most recent results on the RR Lyr distance scale.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys will soon become a reality. This opens up a new
window into the Universe, in many ways analogous to the X-ray band and
inherently well-adapted to reaching high redshifts. I discuss the nature,
abundance and redshift distributions of objects detectable in ground-based
searches with state-of-the-art technology. An advantage of the SZ approach is
that the total SZ flux density depends only on the thermal energy of the
intracluster gas and not on its spatial or temperature structure, in contrast
to the X-ray luminosity. Because ground-based surveys will be characterized by
arcminute angular resolution, they will resolve a large fraction of the cluster
population. I quantify the resulting consequences for the cluster selection
function; these include less efficient cluster detection compared to idealized
point sources and corresponding steeper integrated source counts. This implies,
contrary to expectations based on a point source approximation, that deep
surveys are better than wide ones in terms of maximizing the number of detected
objects. At a given flux density sensitivity and angular resolution, searches
at millimeter wavelengths (bolometers) are more efficient than centimeter
searches (radio), due to the form of the SZ spectrum. Possible ground-based
surveys could discover up to $\sim 100$ clusters per square degree at a
wavelength of 2 mm and $\sim 10$/sq. deg. at 1 cm, modeling clusters as a
simple self-similar population.

reasonably continuous across these edges, while the entropy jumps in the
opposite sense to that in a shock (i.e. the denser side of the edge has lower
temperature, and hence lower entropy). Most plausibly, these edges delineate
the dense subcluster cores that have survived a merger and ram pressure
stripping by the surrounding shock-heated gas.

diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints are ignored. We show that there are
no quantum states in which the primary variables of the loop approach, namely
the SU(2) holonomies along {\em all} possible loops, approximate their
classical counterparts. At most a countable number of loops must be specified.
To preserve spatial covariance, we choose this set of loops to be based on
physical lattices specified by the quasi-classical states themselves. We
construct ``macroscopic'' operators based on such lattices and propose that
these operators be used to analyze the classical limit. Thus, our aim is to
approximate classical data using states in which appropriate macroscopic
operators have low quantum fluctuations.
  Although, in principle, the holonomies of `large' loops on these lattices
could be used to analyze the classical limit, we argue that it may be simpler
to base the analysis on an alternate set of ``flux'' based operators. We
explicitly construct candidate quasi-classical states in 2 spatial dimensions
and indicate how these constructions may generalize to 3d. We discuss the less
robust aspects of our proposal with a view towards possible modifications.
Finally, we show that our proposal also applies to the diffeomorphism invariant
Rovelli model which couples a matter reference system to the Hussain Kucha{\v
r} model.

  Unified Approach to Confidence Intervals","14 pages including figures",,,,"physics.data-an",,"  Roe and Woodroofe (RW) have suggested that certain conditional probabilities
be incorporated into the ``unified approach'' for constructing confidence
intervals, previously described by Feldman and Cousins (FC). RW illustrated
this conditioning technique using one of the two prototype problems in the FC
paper, that of Poisson processes with background. The main effect was on the
upper curve in the confidence belt. In this paper, we attempt to apply this
style of conditioning to the other prototype problem, that of Gaussian errors
with a bounded physical region. We find that the lower curve on the confidence
belt is also moved significantly, in an undesirable manner.

Z is calculated. The WP is defined in terms of solutions of the Dirac equation
in order to take into account all possible relevant effects in particular the
spin-orbit potential. A time scale is defined within which spin dynamics must
be taken into account mainly in the atoms with high Z. Within this time scale
there exists a mechanism of collapses and revivals of the spin already shown by
the authors for harmonic oscillator potential and called the 'spin-orbit
pendulum'. However this effect has not the exact periodicity of the simpler
model, but the WP's spatial motion is nevertheless quite similar.

are found to play a 3-fold role in the drama of the quantum teleportation.
Firstly, the common eigenstate of two commuting canonical observables like
phase-difference and number-sum provides the quantum channel between two
systems. Secondly, a similar pair of canonical observables from another two
systems is measured in the Bell operator measurements.

quantum states which are described by density matrices and physical processes
which are described by completely positive maps. With the help of the
half-density-matrix representation of Hermitian linear map, we show that every
positive map which is not completely positive is a {\em difference} of two
completely positive maps. A necessary and sufficient condition for a positive
map which is not completely positive is also presented, which is illustrated by
some examples.

a misunderstanding and that coherence properties play no role in absorption.
