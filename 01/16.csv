(LMC). Analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the LMC
reveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. This is significantly more than the $\sim$
2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. The
timescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. We estimate the
microlensing optical depth towards the LMC from events with $2 < \that < 400$
days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% of
systematic error. The spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistent
with LMC/LMC disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lens
distribution such as a Milky Way or LMC halo. Interpreted in the context of a
Galactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximum
likelihood analysis gives a MACHO halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo model
with a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. A 100% MACHO halo is ruled out at
the 95% C.L. for all except our most extreme halo model. Interpreted as a
Galactic halo population, the most likely MACHO mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$
and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in MACHOs out
to 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.
These results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but are
lower by about a factor of two. Besides a larger data set, this work also
includes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis,
and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to the
treatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae in
galaxies behind the LMC. [Abridged]

main heating mechanism considered is photoelectrons from grains and PAHs. For
the studied range of F_{nu} values, there always exists two regions of

thermal interstellar pressure is between a maximum value P_{max} and a minimum
value P_{min}. High F_{nu} values (~10^4-10^5 cm^{-2} s^{-1}) can be consistent
with observed interstellar pressures only if more efficient sources are heating
the gas. It is shown that a neutrino flux increase (due, for example, to an
increase in the supernova explosion rate) may stimulate the condensation of
cold gas by decreasing P_{max} below the interstellar pressure value.

feedback in simulations of galaxy formation. Gas-dynamic forces are evaluated
using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) while star formation and supernova
feedback are included using a three parameter model which determines the star
formation rate normalization, feedback energy and lifetime of feedback regions.
The star formation rate is calculated using a Lagrangian Schmidt Law for all
gas particles which satisfy temperature, density and convergent flow criteria.
Feedback is incorporated as thermal heating of the ISM. We compare the effects
of distributing this energy over the smoothing scale or depositing it on a
single particle. Radiative losses are prevented from heated particles by
adjusting the density used in radiative cooling. We test the models on the
formation of galaxies from cosmological initial conditions and also on isolated
Milky Way and dwarf galaxies. Extremely violent feedback is necessary to
produce a gas disk with angular momentum remotely close to that of observed
disk galaxies. This is a result of the extreme central concentration of the
dark halos in the sCDM model, and the pervasiveness of the core-halo angular
momentum transport mechanism. We emphasize that the disks formed in
hierarchical simulations are partially a numerical artifact produced by the
minimum mass scale of the simulation acting as a highly efficient `support'
mechanism. Disk formation is strongly affected by the treatment of dense
regions in SPH, which along with the difficulty of representing the
hierarchical formation process, means that realistic simulations of galaxy
formation require far higher resolution than currently used.

more steeply in the inner parts than the HI rotation curves and reach a flat
part beyond about two disk scale lengths. With radii expressed in optical disk
scale lengths, the rotation curves of the low surface brightness galaxies
presented here and those of HSB galaxies have almost identical shapes. Mass
modeling shows that the contribution of the stellar component to the rotation
curves may be scaled to explain most of the inner parts of the rotation curves,
albeit with high stellar mass-to-light ratios. On the other hand, well fitting

events is about 200-1,000 years, which is assumed to be the cycle period (the

The magnetic field has no dynamical effects; it regulates the mass loss rate by
the formation of magnetic cool spots. The enhanced magnetic activity at the
cycle maximum results in more magnetic cool spots, which facilitate the
formation of dust, hence increasing the mass loss rate. The strong magnetic
activity implies that the AGB star is spun up by a companion, via a tidal or

explains the observations that the concentric semi-periodic shells are found

the temporal oscillation. We find that, at least for the decay at short times,
data collapse occur among the inertial range velocity wave-vector modes with
the long time dynamic exponent $z=2/3$, but the time period of the temporal
oscillation is not universal.

B$ is found in self-consistent way. It is shown that superdeformation and
nonuniform pairing arising from the rotation induced pair density significantly
reduce this inertial parameter. The different limiting cases for $\cal B$,
which allow to study an interplay between rapid rotation, pairing correlations,
and mean field deformation, are considered. The new signature for the
transition from pairing to normal phase is suggested in terms of the variation
of ${\cal B}/{\cal A}$ versus spin. Experimental data indicate the existence of
such transition in the three superdeformed mass regions.

energies for fission of the Au_N^{2-} and Ag_N^{2-} dianions are calculated
using the finite-temperature shell-correction method and allowing for triaxial
deformations. Dianionic clusters with N > 2 are found to be energetically
stable against fission, leaving electron autodetachment as the dominant decay
process. The second electron affinities exhibit pronounced shell effects in
excellent agreement with measured abundance spectra for Au_N^{2-} (N < 30),
with appearance sizes N=12 for gold dianionic clusters and N=24 for silver
dianionic clusters.

  cavity QED","11 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.62.043801",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider continuous observation of the nonlinear dynamics of single atom
trapped in an optical cavity by a standing wave with intensity modulation. The
motion of the atom changes the phase of the field which is then monitored by
homodyne detection of the output field. We show that the conditional Hilbert
space dynamics of this system, subject to measurement induced perturbations,
depends strongly on whether the corresponding classical dynamics is regular or
chaotic. If the classical dynamics is chaotic the distribution of conditional
Hilbert space vectors corresponding to different observation records tends to
be orthogonal. This is a characteristic feature of hypersensitivity to
perturbation for quantum chaotic systems.

"quant-ph/0001057","Lev Vaidman","L. Vaidman","Discussion: Byrne and Hall on Everett and Chalmers","6 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Byrne and Hall (1999) criticized the argument of Chalmers (1996) in favor of
the Everett-style interpretation. They claimed to show ``the deep and
underappreciated flaw in ANY Everett-style interpretation''. I will argue that
it is possible to interpret Chalmers's writing in such a way that most of the
criticism by Byrne and Hall does not apply. In any case their general criticism
of the many-worlds interpretation is unfounded. The recent recognition that the
Everett-style interpretations are good (if not the best) interpretations of
quantum mechanics has, therefore, not been negated.
