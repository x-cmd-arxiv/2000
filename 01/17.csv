metallicity, mass, and radius of the star we derive [Fe/H] = 0.00 +/- 0.02, M =

new analysis of the iron lines in our HIRES template spectrum, and also on the
absolute magnitude and color of the star, and uses isochrones from four
different sets of stellar evolution models. Using these values for the stellar
parameters we reanalyze the transit data and derive an orbital inclination of i

Jupiter masses, a radius of Rp = 1.54 +/- 0.18 Jupiter radii, and a density of

  of abundance gradients","14 pages, 12 figures, accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The oxygen (O/H) and N/O abundance ratios along the bar of 16 barred spiral
starburst galaxies are determined using long-slit spectroscopy. The abundance
gradients and the spatial distribution of the ionized gas along the bar are
used to understand the role of bars in starburst galaxies.
  The oxygen abundance gradients are steeper than in normal barred galaxies,
while the intersects are low. This excludes the possibility that these are
chemically evolved galaxies rejuvenated by the effect of a bar. The
nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance gradients are flatter than the oxygen ones. But
N/O intersects are high, which rules out the possibility that a large quantity
of gas was recently funneled by a bar toward the center of a young galaxy.
Bars, therefore, cannot be at the origin of the bursts in the nuclei of our
sample galaxies.
  The oxygen and N/O abundance gradients are generally stronger in the bar than
in the disk and are linked together by a linear relation. This can be fully
explained in terms of star formation history: the gradients build up from the
inside out, becoming stronger as the oxygen and N/O abundances increase in the
bulge while staying low in the disk.
  In many of the sample galaxies, star formation occurs at one or both ends of
the bar. The low level of chemical enrichment in these regions suggests that
they recently experienced bar-triggered star formation: this is the only
visible effect of bars. Our analysis shows that bars probably appeared very
recently (a few 10^7 years) in the starburst galaxies, which are relatively
""young"" galaxies still in the process of formation.(Abridged)

appeared recently in massive starburst nucleus galaxies. We now test this
hypothesis on an extended sample of barred and unbarred Markarian starburst
galaxies, using several samples of normal galaxies as control samples.
  In support of this hypothesis, we show that the proportion of barred galaxies
is much lower in Markarian starburst galaxies than in normal galaxies. In
addition to this deficiency of bars, we find that Markarian starburst galaxies
have smaller disks than normal galaxies, and that the disks of unbarred
starburst galaxies are smaller, on average, than barred ones. Finally, we show
that the Markarian starburst galaxies do not seem to follow the local
Tully--Fisher relation.
  Various alternatives are examined to explain the deficiency of bars and the
small disk dimensions in Markarian starburst galaxies. One possibility, which
is in agreement with the young bar hypothesis, is that the formation of disks
happens after the formation of bulges and that bars appear only later, when
enough gas has been accreted in the disk.

excitations. The gauge invariance and $CP^{3}$ character of this energy
fuctional and their consequences are examined. Then we identify permissible
classes of finite energy solutions which are topologically non-trivial. We also
numerically evaulate a representative solution in which a pseudospin (layer
degrees of freedom) bimeron in a given spin component is intertwined with
spin-skyrmions in each layer, and and discuss whether it is energetically
favoured as the lowest lying excitation in such system with some numerical

first consider the possibility that this spectroscopic feature results from a
quasi-static charge ordering taking place in the underdoped regime. It comes
out that to explain the coexistence of gaps and arcs on the Fermi surface the
charge modulation should be in an eggbox form. In the lack of evidences for
that, we then investigate the local pairing induced by charge-stripe
fluctuations. A proper description of the strong anisotropy of both the
interactions and the Fermi velocities requires a two-gap model for pairing. We
find that a gap due to incoherent pairing forms near the M-points, while
coherence is established by the stiffness of the pairing near the nodal points.
The model allows for a continuos evolution from a pure BCS pairing (over- and
optimally doped regime) to a mixed boson-fermion model (heavily underdoped
regime).

properties of the distribution.. I further generalize this concept to the
relationship between the scale dependence of a covariance matrix for all
conserved measures defined on a dynamical system and a matrix of covariance
integrals defined on two-point measure spaces, which points the way to a
detailed description of the symmetry dynamics of a complex measure system.

amplitudes and of different kinds of eikonalizations are considered. An
important point in this respect is that secondary structures are predicted in
the differential cross-sections at increasing energies and these phenomena
appear quite directly related to the procedure of eikonalizing the various Born

model dependent). The fitting procedure naturally predicts the appearance of a
zero at small $|t|$ in the real part of the even amplitude as anticipated by
general theorems. We would like to stress, once again, how important it would

defined as integrated out the truly nonperturbative part of the full gluon

minimization procedure makes it possible to determine the value of the soft
cutoff in terms of the corresponding nonperturbative scale parameter which is
inevitably presented in any nonperturbative model for the full gluon
propagator. If the chosen Ansatz for the full gluon propagator is a realistic
one, then our method uniquely determines the truly vacuum energy density, which
is always finite, automatically negative and it has no imaginary part (stable
vacuum). We illustrate it by considering the Abelian Higgs model of dual QCD
ground state. We have explicitly shown that the vacuum of this model without
string contributions is unstable against quantum corrections.

  Dark energy may be owing to interactive gravitational horizons of cousin
universes. The necessary condition for the conjecture to be true is that the
speed of gravity must be faster than the speed of light.The sufficient
condition is that the dark energy content would be increasing with the age of
our Universe, while more and more gravitational horizons of cousin universes
might reach the gravitational horizon of ours in the neighborhood that may be
boundless in space-time flow without beginning or end.

"physics/0001035","Leonid Ya. Kobelev","Leonid Ya. Kobelev","What Dimensions Do the Time and Space Have: Integer or Fractional?","RevTeX, 7 pages",,,,"physics.space-ph gr-qc",,"  A theory of time and space with fractional dimensions (FD) of time and space
($d_{\alpha}, \alpha=t,{\bf r})$ defined on multifractal sets is proposed. The
FD is determined (using principle of minimum the functionals of FD) by the
energy densities of Lagrangians of known physical fields. To describe behaviour
of functions defined on multifractal sets the generalizations of the fractional
Riemann-Liouville derivatives $D_{t}^{d(t)}$ are introduced with the order of
differentiation (depending on time and coordinate) being equal the value of
fractional dimension. For $d_{t}=const$ the generalized fractional derivatives
(GFD) reduce to ordinary Riemann-Liouville integral functionals, and when
$d_{t}$ is close to integer, GFD can be represented by means of derivatives of
integer order. For time and space with fractional dimensions a method to
investigate the generalized equations of theoretical physics by means of GFD is
proposed. The Euler equations defined on multifractal sets of time and space
are obtained using the principle of the minimum of FD functionals. As an
example, a generalized Newton equation is considered and it is shown that this
equation coincide with the equation of classical limit of general theory of
relativity for $d_{t} \to 1$. Several remarks concerning existence of repulsive
gravitation are discussed. The possibility of geometrization all the known
physical fields and forces in the frames of the fractal theory of time and
space is demonstrated.
