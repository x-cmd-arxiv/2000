superluminal radio sources. By comparing the observed proper motions of
components in a parsec scale radio jet to their measured Doppler factors, we
can deduce the distance to the radio source independent of the standard rungs
in the cosmological distance ladder. This technique requires that the jet angle
to the line of sight and the ratio of pattern to flow velocities are
sufficiently constrained. We evaluate a number of possibilities for
constraining these parameters and demonstrate the technique on a well defined
component in the parsec scale jet of the quasar 3C279 (z = 0.536). We find an
angular size distance to 3C279 of greater than 1.8 (+0.5,-0.3) n^{1/8} Gpc,
where n is the ratio of the energy density in the magnetic field to the energy
density in the radiating particles in that jet component. For an Einstein-de
Sitter Universe, this measurement would constrain the Hubble constant to be H <
65 n^{-1/8} km/s/Mpc at the two sigma level. Similar measurements on higher

of observing (depending on the amount of collimation, the width of the GRB

be new ones, but many more would be old, fading afterglows, allowing the
determination of the multi-variate GRB-optical-radio luminosity function of
GRBs. This should elucidate the relation of the `faint' ones, like GRB 980425,

significant source of metal enrichment of the interstellar medium.

approach not only simplifies the calculations but is also readily generalized
from the usual flat-sky approximation to the exact all-sky form by replacing
Fourier harmonics with spherical harmonics. Counterintuitively, due to the
nonlinear nature of the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation do not
improve on smaller scales. They remain at the 10% level through the acoustic

For the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited detection of the correlation with
secondary anisotropies has an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise for
combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than those involving the
temperature alone. Detection of these bispectra will however be severely noise
and foreground limited even with the Planck satellite, leaving room for
improvement with higher sensitivity experiments. We also provide a general

significant difficulty with the proposed mechanisms for GRBs is that a small
amount ($\le 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$) of baryons in the ejecta can be involved.
There are very few models that fulfill this criteria together with other
observational features, among which are the differentially rotating collapsed
object model and the ""supernova"" model. These models generally invoke rapidly
rotating neutron stars, and may be subject to uncertainties in the formation
mechanisms and the equations of state of neutron stars. According to Spruit,
the problem of making a GRB from an X-ray binary is reduced to finding a
plausible way to make the star rotate differentially. We suggest that a model
of strange star (SS) can naturally explain many of these bursts with not only
their low baryon content, but the differential rotation which leads to an
enhanced magnetic field that surfaces up and is responsible for GRBs.

smooth, independent (therefore microlensing) variability between the images

probability functions for high-magnification event parameters with several
observed light-curve features. We conclude that the 1999 image C peak was due
to the source having passed outside of a cusp rather than to a caustic
crossing. In addition, we find that the image C light-curve shows evidence for
a caustic crossing between the 1997 and 1998 observing seasons involving the
appearance of new critical images. Our models predict that the next image C
event is most likely to arrive 500 days following the 1999 peak, but with a
large uncertainty (100-2000 days). Finally, given the image A light-curve
derivative at the end of the 1999 observing season, our modelling suggests that
a caustic crossing will occur between the 1999 and 2000 observing seasons,
implying a minimum for the image A light-curve ~1-1.5 magnitudes fainter than

which includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL). The former provides the star
formation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass and
various geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formed
in different density environments. These quantities allow us to model the SEDs
of galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction and
re-emission. Two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,
where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. The
model includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starbursts
triggered by galaxy mergers. We test our models against the observed
spectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local Universe. The models
reproduce fairly well the SEDs of normal spirals and starbursts, and their
internal extinction properties. The starbursts follow the observed relationship
between the FIR to UV luminosity ratio and the slope of the UV continuum. They
also reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (Calzetti et al 99). This
result is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the Milky
Way extinction law. It suggests that the observed attenuation law is related to
the geometry of the stars and dust. We compute galaxy luminosity functions over
our wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement with
observational data. The UV continuum turns out to be a poor star formation
indicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

coordinate space. When this spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator is
doped, the ground state is a liquid of charged, bosonic meron-vortices, which
for topological reasons are created in vortex-antivortex pairs. The magnetic
exchange energy of the distorted AFM background leads to a logarithmic
vortex-antivortex attraction which overcomes the direct Coulomb repulsion
between holes localized on the vortex cores. This leads to the appearance of
pre-formed charged pairs. We use the Configuration Interaction (CI) Method to
study the quantum translational and rotational motion of various charged

fluctuation and quantum tunneling corrections to the Hartree-Fock Approximation

Those involve a compression of the Mn-O octahedron along the c-axis (mode Q_3 <
0), while alternate Jahn-Teller deformations occur in the ab-plane (mode Q_2).
These deformations stabilize a certain type of orbital ordering. The resulting
superexchange couplings are calculated by exact diagonalization, taking into

(ferromagnetic) coupling along the c-direction (ab-planes) can be understood
only if the Jahn-Teller energy is much larger than the superexchange couplings,

on weak Jahn-Teller coupling which instead predicts elongation along the c-axis

once the list of contacts is known- is established in a quite general context,
and the important distinction between isostatic problems under given external
loads and isostatic (rigid) structures is presented. Complete rigidity is only
guaranteed, on stability grounds, in the case of spherical cohesionless grains.
Otherwise, the network of contacts might deform elastically in response to load
increments, even though grains are rigid. This sets an uuper bound on the
contact coordination number. The approximation of small displacements (ASD)
allows to draw analogies with other model systems studied in statistical
mechanics, such as minimum paths on a lattice. It also entails the uniqueness
of the equilibrium state (the list of contacts itself is geometrically
determined) for cohesionless grains, and thus the absence of plastic
dissipation. Plasticity and hysteresis are due to the lack of such uniqueness
and may stem, apart from intergranular friction, from small, but finite,
rearrangements, in which the system jumps between two distinct potential energy
minima, or from bounded tensile contact forces. The response to load increments
is discussed. On the basis of past numerical studies, we argue that, if the ASD
is valid, the macroscopic displacement field is the solution to an elliptic

stronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the
boundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious
question is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't
Hooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not
fundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that
the mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the
theory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized)
procedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences
to the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious
coordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The
diffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of
this coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary
theory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in
which the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the
average process in the formalism of stochastic quantization. We show where the
stochastic quantization procedure breaks down and argue, in agreement with `t
Hooft, that the quantum degrees of freedom are not fundamental degrees of
freedom. They appear as a limit of a more complex process.

further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdHF approach is used in order
to study the dynamical evolution of the system from non-equilibrium initial

macroscopic size but do scale with the linear size of the system, in accordance
with similar results valid for the large $N$ approximation of the O(N) model.

``stopping at the spinodal line'' of the quantum fluctuations. We also study
the dynamics of the system in infinite volume with particular attention to the

implies that anomalous U(1) vortices in string theory are intrinsically quantum
