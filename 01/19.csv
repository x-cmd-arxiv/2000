another promising technique is offered by the case of the Virgo elliptical NGC
4552, in which early HST/FOC observations revealed a central low-luminosity

revealed a rich emission-line spectrum with broad and narrow components with
FWHM of 3000 and 700 km/s, respectively. This variable, mini-AGN at the center
of NGC 4552 is most naturally the result of a sporadic accretion event on a
central BH. It has a H$\alpha$ luminosity of only $\sim 10,000 \lsun$, making
it the likely, intrinsically faintest AGN known today. Only thanks to the
superior resolution of HST such a faint object has been discovered and studied
in detail, but adaptive optics systems on large ground-based telescopes may
reveal in the future that a low level of accretion onto central massive BHs is
an ubiquitous phenomenon among galactic spheroids. FOC/FOS observations of a

electrons in highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields is different from
synchrotron radiation if the electron's transverse deflections in these fields
are much smaller than the beaming angle. A quantitative analytical theory of
this radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is
shown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the
magnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in
internal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced
by the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with
indices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the
field strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since
large-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a
two-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\gamma$-ray
emission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of
explaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as
(i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the
synchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak
frequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for
two spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features

existence of small-scale magnetic fields and the proposed radiation mechanism

apocenter distances, we have revealed several interesting features in these
distributions. The most remarkable ones include (i) spatial accumulation of
comets near the planetary orbit (which we call the `cometary belt') and (ii)
avoidance of resonant orbits by comets. Then we abandon one-planet

we simulate a stationary distribution of comets, which results from the
gravitational scattering of the Kuiper belt objects on the four giant planets

influence of four giant planets makes the cometary belts overlapping, but
nevertheless keeping almost all their basic features found in one-planet

Survey, MACS aims to compile a sample of more than 200 X-ray luminous clusters
at z>0.3, about 50 times the number of EMSS clusters in the same redshift and
luminosity range. The MACS sample is uniquely suited to investigate cluster
evolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.
  At the time of writing the MACS sample comprises 41 clusters with measured
redshifts of 0.3<z<0.56 and X-ray luminosities in excess of 6 10^44 erg/s
(0.1-2.4 keV). This early sample is thus already twice as large as the high-z,

evolution is not significant at the highest X-ray luminosities (Lx>10^45 erg/s)

obtained by many serendipitous ROSAT cluster surveys at lower luminosities.

correlation between accretion and outflow, broad emission components that are
mostly central or slightly blueshifted and only the occasional presence of
redshifted absorption. We also show, however, that the broad emission
components supposedly formed in the magnetospheric accretion flow only
partially support the models. Unlike the predictions, they are sometimes
redshifted, and are mostly found to be symmetric. The published theoretical

the need for accretion models to include a strong turbulent component before
their profiles will match the observations. The effects of rotation, and the
outflow components, will also be needed to complete the picture.

radiative lifetimes of synchrotron-emitting particles and ii) dynamical source
ages. We discuss how these can be quite discrepant from one another, rendering
use of the traditional spectral ageing method inappropriate: we contend that
spectral ages give meaningful estimates of dynamical ages only when these ages
are << 10^7 years. In juxtaposing the fleeting radiative lifetimes with source
ages which are significantly longer, a refinement of the paradigm for radio
source evolution is required. The changing spectra along lobes are explained,
not predominantly by synchrotron ageing but, by gentle gradients in a magnetic
field mediated by a low-gamma matrix which illuminates an energy-distribution
of particles, controlled largely by classical synchrotron loss in the high
magnetic field of the hotspot. The energy in the particles is an order of
magnitude higher than that inferred from the minimum-energy estimate, implying
that the jet-power is of the same order as the accretion luminosity produced by
the quasar central engine. This refined paradigm points to a resolution of the
findings of Rudnick et al (1994) and Katz-Stone & Rudnick (1994) that both the
Jaffe-Perola and Kardashev-Pacholczyk model spectra are invariably poor
descriptions of the curved spectral shape of lobe emission, and indeed that for

analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies

half-arcminute scale, and interesting constraints on both the temperatures and
Fe abundances are possible because the ~1 keV temperatures of these systems are
well matched to the bandpass of the PSPC. In 9 out of 10 systems we find clear
evidence that the Fe abundance decreases with increasing radius: Z_Fe ~1 solar

this ``Fe Bias'' affects much more seriously the measurements of Z_Fe from ASCA
data than from ROSAT data. We show that the Fe abundance profiles for these
galaxies and groups are consistent with a gas-dynamical model where the gas is
enriched by stellar ejecta and supernovae in the ``solar supernova
proportion'', the stars formed with a Galactic IMF, and the gas is diluted by
mixing with primordial gas at large radii.

form a dense star cluster as massive as the globular cluster. When the initial

from the Hubbard operators which diagonalize the interaction term, we generate
a hierarchy of composite operators from the equations of motion. Using the
Hubbard operators as a basis, we are able to compute the associated Green
functions including the anomalous Green functions which describe pair
formation. We show explicitly that these anomalous Green functions are non-zero
in the d_{x^2-y^2} channel; however, the entities that pair up are not single
electron-like particles but rather composite excitations (which we call cexons)
made out of an electron and a hole on nearest-neighbour sites. Cexons are
fermionic in nature as they have spin 1/2 and also have unit charge. Our
calculations of the chemical potential reveal that negative compressibility in
the 2D Hubbard model and composite excitation pairing are intimately connected,
namely, the larger the negative compressibility, the larger the pairing
amplitude. Our observation of negative compressibility in the under-doped
regime is consistent with phase segregation or stripe formation in the normal
state. While pairing ameliorates the negative compresssibility, it does not
eliminate it entirely. In addition, we find that the anomalous correlation
functions are particle-hole symmetric and exhibit a maximum at a doping level
of roughly 10% as measured from half-filling. For U=8|t|, the onset temperature
for pair formation is 0.02|t|.

flux. The second is a mixed sample of internally produced downward-going muons
and externally produced upward-going muons stopping inside the detector. These
two subsamples are selected by topological criteria; the lack of timing

dramatically reduced computational cost. Highly anisotropic lattices are used,
with fine temporal spacings $a_t$, in order to assess the behavior of the

the potentials for quarks in the fundamental representation. Simulations of the
Wilson loop in the adjoint representation are done, and the energies of
magnetic and electric ``gluelumps'' (adjoint quark-gluon bound states) are

links, are analyzed. Correlation functions of gluelump pairs are also

constants of these states, supplemented by unusually large mass scale,
$M_0\approx 4 GeV$, of the transition boundary to the perturbative regime. As
pomeron is a small-size object by itself, these resonances may play a special
role in its dynamics. Furthermore, we use more realistic description of the
scalar gluonic spectral density without free parameters, and slightly modify

L^N)$ are `asymptotically holomorphic' in the Donaldson-Auroux sense that
$||s_N||_{\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\sqrt{\log N})$, $||\bar{\partial}

concerns the joint probability distribution of the random variables $s_N(z^p),\
\nabla s_N(z^p)$, $1\le p\le n$, for $n$ distinct points $z^1,..., z^n$ in a
neighborhood of a point $P_0\in M$. We show that this joint distribution has a
universal scaling limit about $P_0$ as $N \to \infty$. In particular, the limit
is precisely the same as in the complex holomorphic case. Our methods involve
near-diagonal scaling asymptotics of the Szeg\""o projector $\Pi_N$ onto
$H^0_J(M, L^N)$, which also yields proofs of symplectic analogues of the

to the possible asymmetry of the Levy stable source. Both of them cannot be

considered within the framework of the kinematic approximation, in the presence
of a large-scale background magnetic field. The velocity field is Gaussian,
$\delta$-correlated in time, and scales with a positive exponent $\xi$.
Explicit inertial-range expressions for the magnetic correlation functions are
obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws with
non-universal amplitudes and universal (independent of the anisotropy and
forcing) anomalous exponents. The complete set of anomalous exponents for the
pair correlation function is found non-perturbatively, in any space dimension
$d$, using the zero-mode technique. For higher-order correlation functions, the
anomalous exponents are calculated to $O(\xi)$ using the renormalization group.
The exponents exhibit a hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy; the
leading contributions to the even correlation functions are given by the
exponents from the isotropic shell, in agreement with the idea of restored
small-scale isotropy. Conversely, the small-scale anisotropy reveals itself in
the odd correlation functions : the skewness factor is slowly decreasing going
down to small scales and higher odd dimensionless ratios (hyperskewness etc.)
dramatically increase, thus diverging in the $r\to 0$ limit.

selected states as an indication that F-spin can be regarded as a partial
symmetry. We show that there is a class of non-F-scalar IBM-2 Hamiltonians with
partial F-spin symmetry, which reproduce the known systematics of collective
bands in nuclei. These Hamiltonians predict that the scissors states have good
F-spin and form F-spin multiplets, which is supported by the existing data.

is shown that the q-defomation of bosonic commutation relations is satisfied
naturally by the exciton operators when the low density limit is deviated. An
analytical expression of the physical spectrum for the exciton is given by
using of the dressed states of the cavity field and the exciton. We also give
the numerical study and compare the theoretical results with the experimental
results

  Academy of Sciences",,,"ITP(CAS)-QP(AMO)-2000/3","quant-ph",,"  In order to understand quantum decoherence of a quantum system due to its
interaction with a large system behaving classically, we introduce the concept
of adiabatic quantum entanglement based on the Born-Oppenhemeir approximation.
In the adiabatic limit, it is shown that the wave function of the total system
formed by the quantum system plus the large system can be factorized as an
entangled state with correlation between adiabatic quantum states and
quasi-classical motion configurations of the large system. In association with
a novel viewpoint about quantum measurement, which has been directly verified
by most recent experiments [e.g, S. Durr et.al, Nature 33, 359 (1998)], it is
shown that the adiabatic entanglement is indeed responsible for the quantum
decoherence and thus it can be regarded as a ""clean"" quantum measurement when
the large system behaves as a classical object. The large system being taken
respectively to be a macroscopically distinguishable spatial variable, a high
spin system and a harmonic oscillator with a coherent initial state, three
illustrations are present with their explicit solutions in this paper.
