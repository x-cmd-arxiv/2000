brightest cooling flow galaxies and groups with low Galactic column densities
we have detected intrinsic absorption over energies ~0.4-0.8 keV in half of the

the most reasonable model for the absorber is collisionally ionized gas at
temperatures T=10^{5-6} K with most of the absorption arising from ionized
states of oxygen but with a significant contribution from carbon and nitrogen.
The soft X-ray emission of this warm gas can explain the sub-Galactic column
densities of cold gas inferred within the central regions of most of the
systems. Attributing the absorption to ionized gas reconciles the large columns
of cold H and He inferred from EINSTEIN and ASCA with the lack of such columns
inferred from ROSAT. Within the central ~10-20 kpc, where the constraints are
most secure, the estimated mass of the ionized absorber is consistent with most
(perhaps all) of the matter deposited by a cooling flow over the lifetime of
the flow. Since the warm absorber produces no significant H or He absorption
the large absorber masses are consistent with the negligible atomic and
molecular H inferred from HI and CO observations of cooling flows. It is also
found that if T > ~2x10^5 K then the optical and UV emission implied by the
warm gas does not violate published constraints. Finally, we discuss how the
prediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these and
other cooling flows can be verified with new CHANDRA and XMM observations.

emission line fluxes allow a detailed analysis of the physical conditions

large extinction of the nuclear emission line fluxes in NGC 1052. If the
central ionizing continuum is assumed to be attenuated by a comparable amount,
then the emission line fluxes can be reproduced well by a simple
photoionization model using a central power law continuum source with a
spectral index of alpha = -1.2 as deduced from the observed flux distribution.
A multi-density, dusty gas gives the best fit to the observed emission line
spectrum. Our calculations show that the small contribution from a highly

non-Gaussianities can not be completely removed by the conventional algorithm
of Gaussianization, and the scale-scale correlations are largely retained in
the mass field recovered by the Gaussian mapping. Therefore, the mass power
spectrum recovered by the conventional algorithm is systematically lower than
the initial mass spectrum on scales at which the local scale-scale correlation
is substantial. To reduce the non-Gaussian contamination, we present two
methods. The first is to perform the Gaussianization scale-by-scale using the
discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition. We show that the non-Gaussian
features of the Ly$\alpha$ forest basically will no longer exist in the
scale-by-scale Gaussianized mass field. The second method is to choose a proper
orthonormal basis (representation) to suppress the effect of the non-Gaussian
correlations. In the quasilinear regime of cosmic structure formation, the DWT
power spectrum is efficient for suppressing the non-Gaussian contamination.

properties of the Ha+[N II] 6548,6583 emission-line components. The Ha+[N II]

aligned with the radio axis. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the emission

Another large-scale structure is the grand-design 4-arm spiral pattern, most
clearly observed in the spatial distribution of molecular gas and HII-regions.
  In order to model the observed gas flow structure, we constructed a model for
the stellar mass distribution. For the inner 5 $\kpc$ we used the 3D
deprojected near-IR light distribution, as observed by the COBE/DIRBE
experiment, and added an analytical disk model outside the box as well as a

on (pseudo) Riemannian spaces and in various higher dimensional models of
Kaluza-Klein type and/or generalized Lagrange and Finsler spaces. The
transition rate considered for the locally anisotropic transport equations is
related to the differential cross section and spacetime parameters of
anisotropy. The equations of states for pressure and energy in locally
anisotropic thermodynamics are derived. The obtained general expressions for
heat conductivity, shear and volume viscosity coefficients are applied to
determine the transport coefficients of cosmic fluids in spacetimes with
generic local anisotropy. We emphasize that such locally anisotropic structures
are induced also in general relativity if we are modelling physical processes

Fermion-Loop scheme is applied to the evaluation of observables at LEP 2
energies. Single-W processes are dominated by a regime of low momentum transfer
of the outgoing electron and any high-energy Renormalization Scheme fails to
give the correct description of the scale. The Fermion-Loop scheme
automatically converts all couplings of the theory into couplings that are
running at the appropriate scale. Therefore, in addition to represent the only
scheme fully justified on a field-theoretical basis, the Fermion-Loop is the
best starting point to include radiative corrections into single-W production.
Numerical results are presented, showing a decrease in the predictions that can
be sizeable. There is no naive and overall rescaling of the e.m. coupling
constant, in any pragmatic scheme, that can reproduce the Fermion-Loop results,

enables to describe correctly the passage from the space of the formless finite

suggested. A wave function of a separate FFFE and the overall wave function of
a manifold are introduced. It is shown that many other constructions of the
discrete space-time (the Regge coverings, the lattice space-time etc.) are the
special cases of this space-time. A vacuum action problem is analyzed. One term
of this action is proportional to the volume of a fundamental element. It is

More specifically, we work within a covariant lattice approach where the

building blocks, and the path integral over geometries is approximated by
summing over a class of piece-wise linear geometries. This method of
``dynamical triangulations'' is very powerful in 2d, where the regularized
theory can be solved explicitly, and gives us more insights into the quantum
nature of 2d space-time than continuum methods are presently able to provide.
It also allows us to establish an explicit relation between the Lorentzian- and
Euclidean-signature quantum theories. Analogous regularized gravitational
models can be set up in higher dimensions. Some analytic tools exist to study
their state sums, but, unlike in 2d, no complete analytic solutions have yet
been constructed. However, a great advantage of our approach is the fact that
it is well-suited for numerical simulations. In the second part of this review

gravity. We also explain why the Lorentzian version of dynamical triangulations
is a promising candidate for a non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity.

simple algorithm implementing this summation for any graph. Our results are in
excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations for various graphs.
Moreover we extend our previous notion of an ensemble of graphs by considering
ensemble averages over random boundary conditions imposed at the vertices. We
show numerically that the corresponding form factor follows the predictions of
random-matrix theory when the number of vertices is large---even when all bond
lengths are degenerate. The corresponding combinatorial sum has a structure
similar to the one obtained previously by performing an energy average under
the assumption of incommensurate bond lengths.
