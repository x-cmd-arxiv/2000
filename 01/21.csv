also does not hold as rigorously for the three-point function as for the
two-point function in the n=-2 simulation, perhaps a manifestation of the
finite simulation volume. We suggest that a better understanding of the two-

  Stickel, K. Wilke (eds.), Springer",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Deep X-ray surveys have shown that the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) is
largely due to accretion onto supermassive black holes, integrated over cosmic
time. However, the characteristic hard spectrum of the XRB can only be
explained if most AGN spectra are heavily absorbed. The absorbed AGN will
suffer severe extinction and therefore, unlike classical QSOs, will not be
prominent at optical wavelengths. Most of the accretion power is being absorbed
by gas and dust and will have to be reradiated in the FIR/sub-mm band. AGN
could therefore contribute a substantial fraction to the recently discovered
cosmic FIR/sub-mm background. Here it is shown that a number of high-redshift
absorbed X-ray sources selected in the ROSAT Deep Survey of the Lockman Hole
have broad-band spectral energy distributions very similar to the local ULIRG
NGC6240, lending additional support to the background models for the obscured

In this article, we study this problem for both the CMB third moment and the

merger and accretion rates. We demonstrate the importance of correcting these
(and other) pair statistics for selection effects related to sample depth and
completeness. In particular, we highlight the severe bias that can result from
the use of a flux-limited survey. The first statistic, denoted N_c, gives the
number of companions per galaxy, within a specified range in absolute
magnitude. N_c is directly related to the galaxy merger rate. The second
statistic, called L_c, gives the total luminosity in companions, per galaxy.
This quantity can be used to investigate the mass accretion rate. Both N_c and
L_c are related to the galaxy correlation function and luminosity function in a
straightforward manner. We outline techniques which account for various
selection effects, and demonstrate the success of this approach using Monte
Carlo simulations. If one assumes that clustering is independent of luminosity
(which is appropriate for reasonable ranges in luminosity), then these
statistics may be applied to flux-limited surveys.
  These techniques are applied to a sample of 5426 galaxies in the SSRS2
redshift survey. Using close dynamical pairs, we find N_c(-21<M_B<-18) =
0.0226+/-0.0052 and L_c(-21<M_B<-18) = 0.0216+/-0.0055 10^{10} h^2 L_sun at

If N_c remains fixed with redshift, simple assumptions imply that ~ 6.6% of
present day galaxies with -21<M_B<-18 have undergone mergers since z=1. When
applied to redshift surveys of more distant galaxies, these techniques will
yield the first robust estimates of evolution in the galaxy merger and

core. As the star's spin rate slows, the changing stellar shape stresses the
crust and causes fractures. These starquakes may trigger pulsar glitches as
well as the jumps in spin-down rate that are observed to persist after some
glitches. Earlier studies found that starquakes in spinning-down neutron stars
push matter toward the magnetic poles, causing temporary misalignment of the
star's spin and angular momentum. After the star relaxes to a new equilibrium
orientation, the magnetic poles are closer to the equator, and the magnetic
braking torque is increased. The magnitude and sign of the predicted torque
changes are in agreement with the observed persistent spin-down offsets. Here
we examine the relaxation processes by which the new equilibrium orientation is
reached. We find that the neutron superfluid in the inner crust slows as the
star's spin realigns with the angular momentum, causing the crust to spin more
rapidly. For plausible parameters the time scale and the magnitude of the
crust's spin up agree with the giant glitches in the Vela and other pulsars.

doubling/halving time scale comprised in the range 30-75 ks. A model composed
by a simple power-law, with photon index ~1.8 and an absorption edge, whose
threshold energy is consistent with K-shell photoionization of OVII, provides
an adequate fit of the spectrum. This suggests that we are observing the
emission from the nuclear region through a warm absorber of N_H a few
10^{21}/cm/cm. If it has internal dust with Galactic gas-to-dust ratio, it
could explain the lack of broad Hbeta emission, even in the episodic presence
of a broad Halpha emission line. Optical spectra obtained over several years
show indeed variations in the strength of this broad Halpha component. A
distribution of dusty, optically thick matter on spatial scales a few hundreds
parsec, which does not intercept the line of sight towards the nucleus, is
probably required to account simultaneously for the relative [OIII] luminosity
deficit in comparison to the X-rays. The high IR to X-ray luminosity ratio is
most likely due to intense star formation in the circumnuclear region.

molecular clouds and star-forming regions. There is a need for adequate tools
to describe and characterize the properties of turbulent flows. One-point
probability distribution functions (pdf's) of dynamical variables have been
suggested as appropriate statistical measures and applied to several observed
molecular clouds. However, the interpretation of these data requires comparison
with numerical simulations. To address this issue, SPH simulations of driven
and decaying, supersonic, turbulent flows with and without self-gravity are
presented. In addition, random Gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to
estimate the influence of variance effects. To characterize the flow
properties, the pdf's of the density, of the line-of-sight velocity centroids,
and of the line centroid increments are studied. This is supplemented by a
discussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment pdf's, as well
as the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags. From
the comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence, it follows
that the inclusion of self-gravity leads to better agreement with the observed
pdf's in molecular clouds. The increment pdf's for small spatial lags become
exponential for all considered velocities. However, all the processes
considered here lead to non-Gaussian signatures, differences are only gradual,
and the analyzed pdf's are in addition projection dependent. It appears
therefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on
the basis of pdf's only, which limits their applicability for adequately
characterizing interstellar turbulence.

M_\odot of MACHOs. According to this framework, gravitational microlensing is
indirectly ``weighing"" the axion mass, resulting in \sim 10^{-10} eV/c^2. This
conclusion is not changing much, if we use a dilaton type self-interaction for
the bosons. Moreover, we review their formation, rotation and stability as
likely candidates of astrophysical importance.

consists of an iron/liquid scintillator sampling calorimeter followed by a muon
spectrometer. The calorimeter response to hadrons, muons and electrons has been
measured in an in situ calibration beam over the energy range from 4.5 to 190
GeV. The small non-linearity of the response to hadrons is compared to the
expectation from the measured ratio of responses between electrons and hadrons
combined with the energy dependence of the fractional electromagnetic energy
deposition in the form of neutral pions in hadronic showers
$f_{\pi^{0}}(E_{\pi})$. The predictions use $f_{\pi^{0}}(E_{\pi})$ from the
Monte Carlo simulations by GHEISHA, GFLUKA and GCALOR and also from the

polarization measurement are considered: the jet handedness and the so-called
""Collins effect"" due to spin dependent T-odd fragmentation function responsible
for the left-right asymmetry in fragmenting of transversally polarized quarks.
Recent experimental indications in favor of these effects are observed: 1.The
correlation of the T-odd one-particle fragmentation functions found by DELPHI
in $Z\to 2$-jet decay. Integrated over the fraction of longitudinal and
transversal momenta, this correlation is of 1.6% order, which means order of
13% for the analyzing power. 2.A rather large ($\approx10%$) handedness
transversal to the production plane observed in the diffractive production of
($\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$) triples from nuclei by the $40 {\rm GeV/c}$ $\pi^-$--beam.
It shows a clear dynamic origin and resembles the single spin asymmetry
behavior.
  All this makes us hope to use these effects in polarized DIS experiments for
transversity measurement. The first estimation of transversity was done by
using the azimuthal asymmetry in semi-inclusive DIS recently measured by HERMES
and SMC.

are studied in detail, and it is shown that only for negative curvature
(hyperbolic) internal spaces, some amount of supersymmetry can be preserved.
Among other solutions, we find that the extremal rotating BTZ black hole
tensored by H^2 preserves one quarter of supersymmetry.

from what we claim are basic properties of any physical theory - i.e. the
notion that a quantity in such a theory may be analysed into parts and that the
results of this analysis may be treated in languages with an underlying boolean
structure. We shall see that in the course of constructing a model of a theory
with these properties different indistinguishable possibilities will arise for
how the elements of the model may be named, that is to say different
possibilities arise for how they can be associated with points from Set. Taking
a particular collection of possibilities gives the usual boolean lattice of the
propositions of classical physics. Taking all possibilities - in a sense, the
set of all things that may be described by physical theories - gives the

stochastic motion of the quantized micro particles powerfully to break up the
smooth thin line of the classical motion of the same micro particle in many
broad cylindrically spread path. The SE participate in stochastically roughly
determined circumferences within different flats and with different radii, with
centres which are successively arranjed over short and very disorderly
orientated lines. Therefore the quantized motion of some micro particle cannot
be descripted by smooth thin well contured (focused) line, describing the
classical motion of the macro particle.

  for Description of its Quantum Behaviour","Latex, 9 pajes, no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The physical model (PhsMdl) of a Schrodinger nonrelativistic quantized
electron (ShEl) is built by means of a transition of the quadratic differential
particle equation of Hamilton-Jacoby into the quadratic differential wave
equation of Schrodinger in this work, which interprets the physical reason of
its quantum (wave and stochastic) behaviour by explanation of the physical
reason, which forces the classical Lorentz electron (LrEl) to participate in
Furthian quantized stochastic oscillation motion, which turn it into quantum
ShEl. It is performed that this transition is realized by my consideration the
Bohm's quantum potential as a kinetic energy of the forced Furthian quantized
stochastic oscillation motion of the ShEl's well spread elementary electric
charge close to a smooth thin trajectory of a classical LrEl. There exist as an
essential analogy between the Furthian quantum stochastic trembling oscillation
motion and the Brownian classical stochastic trembling motion so and between
the description of their behaviours.

polarisation entanglement {\em without} the usual large vacuum contribution.
  The optical circuits we consider involve passive interferometers,
feed-forward detection, down-converters and squeezers. For input vacuum fields
we find that the creation of maximal entanglement using such circuits is
impossible when conditioned on two detected auxiliary photons. So far, there
have been no experiments with more auxiliary photons. Thus, based on the
minimum complexity of the circuits required, if near maximal polarisation
entanglement is possible it seems unlikely that it will be implemented
experimentally with the current resources.

its eigenstates and the result of the measurement is one of its eigenvalues.
This process is shown to be a computational resource. It allows one, in
principle, to diagonalize hermitean (N by N) matrices by quantum mechanical
measurements only. To do so, one considers the given matrix as an observable of
a single spin with appropriate length s=(N-1)/2, which can be measured using a
generalized Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Then, each run provides one eigenvalue of
the observable. As it is based on the `collapse of the wave function'
associated with a measurement, the procedure is neither a digital nor an analog
calculation--it defines thus a new quantum mechanical method of computation.
