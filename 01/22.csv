were calculated from their chromospheric emission levels using a new
metallicity-dependent chromospheric activity-age relation developed by

include partially the effects of the stellar magnetic cycles, although a
detailed treatment of this error is still beyond our knowledge. It is shown
that the results are not affected by the presence of unresolved binaries in the

found by previous workers. The mean metallicity shows a slow, steady increase
with time, amounting at least 0.56 dex in 15 Gyr. The initial metallicity of
the disk is around -0.70 dex, in agreement with the G dwarf metallicity
distribution. According to our data, the intrinsic cosmic dispersion in metal
abundances is around 0.13 dex, a factor of two smaller than that found by
Edvardsson et al. (1993). We show that chromospheric ages are compatible with
isochrone ages, within the expected errors, so that the difference in the
scatter cannot be caused by the accuracy of our ages and metallicities. This
reinforces some suggestions that the Edvarsson et al.'s sample is not suitable

Daubechies 4 wavelet basis. We show that these results depend critically on the
orientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. For two
distinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of the
skewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding wavelet
coefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. We obtain
several detections of non-Gaussianity in the DMR-DSMB map at greater than the
99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales and
are therefore not cosmological in origin. Indeed, after removing all multipoles
beyond $\ell = 40$ from the COBE maps, only one robust detection remains.
Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of
obtaining such a detection by chance is 0.59. We repeat the analysis for the
53+90 GHz coadded COBE map. In this case, after removing $\ell > 40$
multipoles, two non-Gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain.
Nevertheless, again using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability
of obtaining two such detections by chance is 0.28. Thus, we conclude the
wavelet technique does {\em not} yield strong evidence for non-Gaussianity of
cosmological origin in the 4-year COBE data.

abundances with respect to their initial values, one must ensure - by
calibrating the initial chemical composition of the theoretical models - that
the surface abundances of the models match the observed ones of the stellar
population under scrutiny. Since the observed surface abundances of subdwarfs
are different from the initial ones due to the effect of diffusion, while the
globular clusters stellar abundances are measured in Red Giants, which have
practically recovered their initial abundances after the dredge-up, the
isochrones to be employed for studying globular clusters and Halo subdwarfs

absolute ages, the age dispersion, the age-metallicity relation for Halo

provides a mass estimate for the M dwarf companion, M_dM = 0.37 +- 0.20

Radial velocities from Vennes and Thorstensen (1994) provide a mass ratio from

explained by an external shock model where a single relativistic blast wave
interacts with the surrounding medium. Besides reproducing the generic spectral
behavior of GRB profiles, the external shock model provides quantitative fits
to the peak flux distribution, the > 1 s t_{50} duration distribution, and the
distribution of the peaks E_pk of the vF_v spectra of GRBs measured with BATSE.
The apparent paradox between a relativistic beaming scenario and the empirical
finding that E_pk values are preferentially measured within the triggering
range of a GRB detector is resolved by this model when blast wave physics and
detector triggering criteria are taken into account. Some surprising
implications follow, namely that the fireball event rate is ~1 per 10^4 years
per Milky Way galaxy for unbeamed sources, and proportionally more if fireball
outflows are collimated. This is ~ 3 orders of magnitude larger than normally
quoted. Most of the clean and dirty fireball transients are undetected due to
telescope sensitivity and design limitations.
  Strongly variable GRB time histories with good radiative efficiencies are
possible because of the strongly enhanced emissions when a blast wave interacts
with density inhomogeneities located nearly along the line-of-sight to the
observer. Arguments against short timescale variability in an external shock
model are answered, and difficulties in an internal shock/colliding shell model
are mentioned.

starbursting ELG and normal galaxy populations, using nearest neighbor and
correlation function statistics. This allows us to determine whether the
activity in ELGs is primarily caused by gravitational interactions. We conclude
that galaxy-galaxy encounters are not the sole cause of activity in ELGs since
ELGs tend to be more isolated and are more often found in the voids when
compared to their normal galaxy counterparts. Furthermore, statistical analyses
performed on low-luminosity dwarf ELGs show that the dwarfs are less clustered
when compared to their non-active giant neighbors. The UM dwarf samples have
greater percentages of nearest neighbor separations at large values and lower
correlation function amplitudes relative to the UZC giant galaxy samples. These
results are consistent with the expectations of galaxy biasing.

probed redshift range. Second, we have correlated 134 z>4 quasars, comprising
all such sources that we are aware of as of mid-1999, with FIRST and NVSS.
These two recent 1.4 GHz VLA sky surveys reach 3-sigma limits of approximately
0.6 mJy and 1.4 mJy respectively. We identify a total of 15 z>4 quasars, of

surveys does not reach the radio-loud/radio-quiet demarcation luminosity
density (L(1.4 GHz) = 10^32.5 h(50)^(-2) ergs/s/Hz) at the redshift range

morphology and X-ray emission depend on the host galaxy's ISM distribution,
starburst star formation history and strength, and presence and distribution of
mass-loading by dense clouds. We find that the soft X-ray emission from
galactic winds comes from low filling factor (ff < 2 per cent) gas, which
contains only a small fraction (f < 10 per cent) of the mass and energy of the
wind, irrespective of whether the wind models are strongly mass-loaded or not.
X-ray observations of galactic winds therefore do not directly probe the gas
that contains the majority of the energy, mass or metal-enriched gas in the
outflow. The soft X-ray emission comes from gas at a wide range different
temperatures and densities. Estimates of the physical properties of the hot gas
in starburst galaxies, based on fitting the standard simple spectral models to
existing X-ray spectra, should therefore be treated with extreme suspicion. The
majority of the thermal and kinetic energy of these winds is in a volume
filling hot, T approx 10^7 K, component which is extremely difficult to probe
observationally due to its low density and hence low emissivity. Most of the
total energy is in the kinetic energy of this hot gas, a factor which must be
taken into account when attempting to constrain wind energetics
observationally. We also find that galactic winds are efficient at transporting
large amounts of energy out of the host galaxy, in contrast to their
inefficiency at transporting mass out of star-forming galaxies. (Abridged)

formation history (SFH) of galaxies. The evolution of the star formation
activity is followed on a wide range of redshifts (0< z < 4) covering most of
the history of the Universe. Two incompatible interpretations of the
observations are currently competing. After applying star formation rate (SFR)
conversion factors to the CFRS, Halpha or ISO samples, many authors conclude to
a strong increase (~ a factor 10) of the SFR from z=0 to z=1. They also find
some evidence for a peak at z~1 and for a rapid decrease at higher redshifts.
On the other side, the Hawaii deep surveys favor only a mild increase between
z=0 and 1 (Cowie et al., 1996, 1999). To understand the reason for these
discrepant interpretations, we consider three classes of galaxies: E/S0,
Sa-Sb-Sbc, Sc-Sd-Im and bursting dwarfs. We use the new version of our
evolutionary synthesis code, PEGASE which takes into account metallicity and
dust effects. The main results are: i) Late-type galaxies contribute
significantly to the local SFR, especially bursting dwarfs (Fioc and
Rocca-Volmerange, 1999). Because of that, the cosmic SFR can not decrease by a
factor 10 from z=0 to 1. This is in agreement with Cowie's result. ii) The SFR
of intermediate-type galaxies has strongly decreased since z=1. Though the
decrease is less than what find Lilly et al., 1996, this suggests that the CFRS
and Halpha surveys are dominated by such bright early spirals. iii) The
contribution of early-type galaxies increases rapidly from z=1 to their
redshift of formation (> 2-3 for cosmological reasons). Their intense star
formation rates at high-z give strong constraints on early ionization phases,
primeval populations or metal enrichments.(abridged)

spin-density-wave states, in which s-wave particle-hole pairs condense. We show
that the p-wave spin-singlet state of this type has Peierls ordering, while the

Hamiltonians which favor p-wave and d-wave density wave order. There are
analogous orderings for pure spin models, which generalize spin-Peierls order.
The spin-triplet density wave states are accompanied by spin-1 Goldstone
bosons, but these excitations do not contribute to the spin-spin correlation
function. Hence, they must be detected with NQR or Raman scattering
experiments. Depending on the geometry and topology of the Fermi surface, these
states may admit gapless fermionic excitations. As the Fermi surface geometry
is changed, these excitations disappear at a transition which is third-order in
mean-field theory. The singlet d-wave and triplet p-wave density wave states
are separated from the corresponding superconducting states by zero-temperature

heterotic M-theory, which occur when all, or part, of the wrapped five-branes
in the five-dimensional bulk space come into direct contact with a boundary
brane. These transitions involve the transformation of the five-brane into a
``small instanton'' on the Calabi-Yau space at the boundary brane, followed by
the ``smoothing out'' of the small instanton into a holomorphic vector bundle.
Small instanton phase transitions change the number of families, the gauge
group or both on the boundary brane, depending upon whether a base component,
fiber component or both components of the five-brane class are involved in the
transition. We compute the conditions under which a small instanton phase
transition can occur and present a number of explicit, phenomenologically
relevant examples.

the conventional treatment of first class constraints. It suggests, in
particular, to compute the symplectic form on the reduced space by a fiber
integral of the symplectic form on the original space. This approach is then
applied to a class of systems with loop group symmetry. The chiral anomaly of
the loop group action spoils the first class character of the constraints but
not their closure. Proceeding along the general lines described above, we
obtain a 2-form from a fiber (path)integral. This form is not closed as a
relict of the anomaly. Examples of such reduced spaces are provided by D-branes
on group manifolds with WZW action.
