than a few arcminutes were generated at z > 800, the low redshift universe does
distort the microwave background. Since the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
traces the structures in the low-redshift universe, we can gain additional
insights into the physics of the low-redshift universe by cross-correlating
microwave background maps with template maps produced from the SDSS. We present
a formalism for cross-correlating data from the Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(MAP) with the Sloan Survey for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, the
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and weak lensing. This formalism is used
to compute the signal-to-noise for cross-correlating these effects with various
classes of tracer objects from the SDSS. It is found that the anticipated
samples of SDSS quasars and galaxies with photometrically-determined redshifts
would be good tracers for cross-correlating with the CMB. We find that the
SZ-galaxy cross-correlation would give good constraints on pressure
fluctuations in supercluster-scale gas. Cross-correlating weakly-lensed quasars
with maps of the convergence of the CMB is found to give strong constraints on
Omega_0 as well as the equation of state w. We find that the ISW
cross-correlation gives poor signal-to-noise using these techniques.

discussed. All involve the failure of neutrino energy deposition to launch a
strong supernova explosion. A key quantity which determines the type of high
energy transient produced is the ratio of the engine operation time, $\rm
t_{engine}$, to the time for the explosion to break out of the stellar surface,
$\rm t_{bo}$. Stars with sufficient angular momentum produce collapsars --
black holes accreting rapidly through a disk -- in their centers. Collapsars
can occur in stars with a wide range of radii depending on the amount of
pre-collapse mass loss. The stellar radius and jet properties determine the
degree of beaming of the explosion. In some cases the stellar envelope serves
to focus the explosion to narrow beaming angles. The baryon loading of various
models for classical GRBs formed in massive stars is examined and the
consequences are explored. For $\rm t_{engine} > t_{bo}$, highly relativistic
outflow is possible and classical GRBs accompanied by supernovae can be
produced. In other cases hyper-energetic, asymmetric supernovae are produced.
Longer GRBs ($t \gtaprx 100 \s$) can be produced by fallback following a weak
neutrino-driven supernova explosion.

is a very exotic material with a superconducting order parameter whose ground
state symmetry has remained ill-defined. Here we present a pulsed NMR Knight
shift (K) study of $^{77}$Se measured simultaneously with transport in
pressurized (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$. The Knight shift is linearly dependent on the
electron spin susceptibility $\chi_s$, and is therefore a direct measure of the
spin polarization in the superconducting state. For a singlet superconductor,
the spin contribution to the Knight shift, K$_s$, falls rapidly on cooling
through the transition. The present experiments indicate no observable change
in K between the metallic and superconducting states, and thus strongly support
the hypothesis of triplet p-wave superconductivity in (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$.

We argue that from a pedagogical point of view, using these coordinates comes
with several drawbacks, and we advocate the use of simpler, but equally
effective, coordinate systems. One such system, introduced by Painleve and
Gullstrand in the 1920's, is especially simple and pedagogically powerful; it
is, however, still poorly known today. One of our purposes here is therefore to
popularize these coordinates. Our other purpose is to provide generalizations
to the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates, first within the specific context of
Schwarzschild spacetime, and then in the context of more general spherical
spacetimes.

numerical methods are used to examine harmonic slicings of Kasner and Gowdy
cosmological spacetimes. It is shown that in general the slicings are prevented
from covering the whole of the spacetimes by the appearance of coordinate
singularities. As well as limiting the maximum running times of numerical
simulations, the coordinate singularities can lead to features being produced
in numerically evolved solutions which must be distinguished from genuine
physical effects.

likely to be produced at RHIC (BNL) and LHC (CERN) energies is estimated taking
into account bremsstrahlung. The plasma is assumed to be in local thermal
equilibrium, but with a phase space distribution that deviates from the Fermi
or Bose distribution by space-time dependent factors (fugacities). The photon
spectrum is obtained by integrating the photon rate over the space-time history
of the plasma, adopting a boost invariant cylindrically symmetric transverse
expansion of the system with different nuclear profile functions. Initial
conditions obtained from a self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for
comparison, from the HIJING model are used. Compared to an equilibrated plasma
at the same initial energy density, taken from the self-screened parton
cascade, a moderate suppression of the photon yield by a factor of one to five
depending on the collision energy and the photon momentum is observed. The
individual contributions to the photon production, however, are completely
different in the both scenarios.
