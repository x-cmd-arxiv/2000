information on GRBs, indicating their self-similar temporal structure. The best
power-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T_90>100 s) in which the
range of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts
have apparent PDS slopes more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations.
The underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging
the PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power law has a slope approximately
equal to -5/3 and a sharp break at about 1 Hz.
  The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of GRBs. In
particular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate energy channels.
The PDS flattens in the hard channel (h\nu>300 keV) and steepens in the soft
channel (h\nu<50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light curves approximately
follows the -5/3 law.
  We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find a
strong correlation between the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This
correlation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim
bursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is
probably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a
cosmological redshift.

suggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as the
radio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. The
gas temperature declines from 4 keV at 70 kpc to 3 keV in the inner 20 kpc of
the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the cooling time of the gas is $\sim
600$ Myr in the inner 10 kpc. These properties are consistent with the presence
of a $\sim 34 \msunyr$ cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius. Bright X-ray
emission is present in the BCG surrounding a recently-accreted disk of nebular
emission and young stars. The star formation rate is commensurate with the
cooling rate of the hot gas within the volume of the disk, although the sink
for the material cooling at larger radii remains elusive.

galaxies. We found that most of these properties and correlations are the
result of three (cosmological) initial factors and their dispersions: the
virial mass, the halo mass aggregation history (MAH), and the angular momentum
given through the spin parameter \lambda. The MAH determines mainly the halo
structure and the color indexes while \lambda determines mainly the surface
brightness and the bulge-to-disk ratio. We calculated star formation (SF) using
a gravitational instability criterion and a self-regulation mechanism in the
turbulent ISM. The efficiency of SF in this model is almost independent from
the mass. We show that the luminosity-dependent dust absorption empirically
determined by Wang & Heckman explains the observed color-magnitude and color
Tully-Fisher (TF) relations without the necessity of introducing a
mass-dependent SF efficiency. The disks in centrifugal equilibrium form within
growing CDM halos with a gas accretion rate proportional to the MAH. The disks
present exponential surface density and brightness profiles, negative radial
color index gradients, and nearly flat rotation curves. We also calculated the
secular formation of a bulge due to gravitational instabilities in the stellar
disk. The intensive properties of our models agree with the observational data
and the trends of the Hubble sequence are reproduced. The predicted infrared TF
and luminosity-radius relations also agree with observations. The main
shortcomings of our inside-out hierarchical models are the excessive radial
color gradients and the dark halo dominion in the rotation curve
decompositions.

only large, tenuous, evolved PNs with hot central stars and small absorption
column densities have been detected. The origin of hard X-ray emission from PNs
is uncertain. PNs with Type 2 spectra are small, dense, young nebulae with
relatively cool (<<10^5 K) central stars, while PNs with Type 3 X-ray spectra

luminosities are also different between these two types of PNs, indicating
perhaps different origins of their hard X-ray emission. Future Chandra and XMM

electrons, positrons and photons in high external electric E and arbitrary
magnetic H fields is solved. The consideration is made under the conditions of
arbitrary heating and the mutual drag of carriers and photons.
  The non-stationary and non-uniform distribution function (DF) of photons for
the all considered cases is obtained. It is shown that the DF of photons have
the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to
}\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) <1$ and becomes exponentially grown
by the time for the drift velocities
$(\overset{\to}\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. It is shown
that the mutual drag of carriers and photons leads to the formation of
''quasi-particles''\_ the ''electron dressed by photons'' and ''positron
dressed by photons'', i.e. the mutual drag plays the role of the dressing
mechanism of carriers and leads to the renormalization of the mass and
frequency of photons.
  As a result of analyses of the phenomena of connected by the mutual drag
system of carriers and photons we receive some fundamental results: a) the
finiteness of the mass of photon (i.e. the rest mass of photons do not equal to
zero); b) reality of takhyons as a quasi-particles with the real mass in
amplifying system (or regime); c) identity of the mechanism of relativity and
the Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or
mass as a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field
(force). These conclusions were received as a result of the fact that the
relativistic factor enters to the expressions of the DF of photons and other
physical expressions in the first order in the form $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1}$,
instead the $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1/2}$ in Einstein theory. It is shown that the
relativistic effect of deceleration of time really taking place for the
relaxation time of carriers or for the life time of carriers, or for the period
of electromagnetic oscillations. The latest is a direct result of the Doppler
effect. Also it is shown that the velocity of light is an averaged velocity of
photons at the ground state, as well as a velocity of sound for the phonons.

hydrodynamical model may be modified to recover the missing terms that are
dictated by symmetries. The symmetry and conservation arguments are powerful in
that the form of the equation is model-independent. We then present an
extensive numerical and analytical analysis of the generic sand ripple
equation. We find that at the initial stage the wavelength of the ripple is
that corresponding to the linearly most dangerous mode. At later stages the
profile undergoes a coarsening process leading to a significant increase of the
wavelength. We find that including the next higher order nonlinear term in the
equation, leads naturally to a saturation of the local slope. We analyze both

exponent for the mean wavelength increase. We discuss some future lines of

phase ordering dynamics of the Heisenberg model when the total magnetization is
conserved. The torque drives the zero-temperature ordering dynamics to a new
fixed point, characterized by exponents $z=2$ and $\lambda \approx 5$. This
`torque-driven' fixed point is approached at times such that $g^2 t\gg 1$,
where $g$ is the strength of the torque. All physical quantities, like the
domain size $L(t)$ and the equal and unequal time correlation functions obey a
crossover scaling form over the entire range of $g$. An attempt to understand
this crossover behavior from the approximate Gaussian Closure Scheme fails
completely, implying that the dynamics at late times cannot be understood from
the dynamics of defects alone. We provide convincing arguments that the spin
configurations can be decomposed in terms of defects and spin-waves which
interact with each other even at late times. In the absence of the torque term,
the spin waves decay faster, but even so we find that the Gaussian closure
scheme is inconsistent. In the latter case the inconsistency may be remedied by
including corrections to a simple gaussian distribution. For completeness we
include a discussion of the ordering dynamics at $T_c$, where the torque is
shown to be relevant, with exponents $z=4-\epsilon/2$ and $\lambda = d$ (where
$\epsilon = 6-d$). We show to all orders in perturbation theory that
$\lambda=d$ as a consequence of the conservation law.

subject to an uniform shear flow quenched from a disordered to a homogeneous
ordered phase. The kinetics of the process is described in the context of the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with an external velocity term. The
large-N approximation is used to study the evolution of the model in the
presence of a stationary flow and in the case of an oscillating shear.
  For stationary flow we show that the structure factor obeys a generalized
dynamical scaling. The domains grow with different typical lengthscales $R_x$
and $R_\perp$ respectively in the flow direction and perpendicularly to it. In
the scaling regime $R_\perp \sim t^{\alpha_\perp}$ and $R_x \sim \gamma
t^{\alpha_x}$ (with logarithmic corrections), $\gamma $ being the shear rate,
with $\alpha_x=5/4$ and $\alpha_\perp =1/4$. The excess viscosity $\Delta \eta$
after reaching a maximum relaxes to zero as $\gamma ^{-2}t^{-3/2}$. $\Delta
\eta$ and other observables exhibit log-time periodic oscillations which can be
interpreted as due to a growth mechanism where stretching and break-up of
domains cyclically occur.
  In the case of an oscillating shear a cross-over phenomenon is observed:
Initially the evolution is characterized by the same growth exponents as for a
stationary flow. For longer times the phase separating structure cannot align

interest. Two main classes of membranes can be distinguished: Fluid membranes
and polymerized, tethered membranes. Here, we review progress in the
theoretical understanding of polymerized membranes, i.e. membranes with a fixed
internal connectivity. We start by collecting basic physical properties,
clarifying the role of bending rigidity and disorder, theoretically and
experimentally as well as numerically. We then give a thorough introduction
into the theory of self-avoiding membranes, or more generally non-local field
theories with delta-like interactions. Based on a proof of perturbative
renormalizability for non-local field-theories, renormalization group
calculations can be performed up to 2-loop order, which in 3 dimensions predict
a crumpled phase with fractal dimension of about 2.4. The tricritical behavior
of membranes is discussed and shown to be quite different from that of
polymers. Dynamical properties are studied in the same frame-work. Along the
same lines, disorder can be included leading to interesting applications. We
also construct a generalization of the O(N)-model, which in the limit N->0
reduces to self-avoiding membranes in analogy with the O(N)-model, which in the
limit N->0 reduces to self-avoiding polymers. We also describe the
instanton-contribution governing the large-order behavior of perturbation
theory. Some technical details are relegated to the appendices.

on a four-sheeted Riemann surface. It describes well all existing experimental
space-like and time-like data on the nucleon e.m. form factors (ff's),
including also FENICE (Frascati) results on the neutron, for the first time.
This is achieved without any external constraints on the isovector spectral
functions following from the piN-scattering data and pion e.m. ff behaviour
through the unitarity condition. Just opposite, the model itself predicts a
pronounced effect of the two-pion continuum on the isovector spectral functions
revealing the strong enhancement of the left wing of the rho(770)-resonance
close to two-pion threshold. The existence of the fourth excited state of the
rho(770) meson with parameters mass and width equal to 2506 MeV and 700 MeV,
respectively. The isoscalar spectral function behaviours are predicted by the
presented model.

equation in which the dispersion coefficient changes its sign from normal to
anomalous. The model has direct applications to dispersion-decreasing nonlinear
optical fibers, and to natural waveguides for internal waves in the ocean. It
is found that, depending on the (conserved) energy and (nonconserved) mass of
the initial pulse, four qualitatively different outcomes of the pulse
transformation are possible: decay into radiation; self-trapping into a single
soliton; formation of a breather; and formation of a pair of counterpropagating
solitons. A corresponding chart is drawn on a parametric plane, which
demonstrates some unexpected features. In particular, it is found that any kind
of soliton(s) (including the breather and counterpropagating pair) eventually
decays into pure radiation with the increase of the energy, the initial mass
being kept constant. It is also noteworthy that a virtually direct transition
from a single soliton into a pair of symmetric counterpropagating ones seems
possible. An explanation for these features is proposed. In two cases when
analytical approximations apply, viz., a simple perturbation theory for broad
initial pulses, or the variational approximation for narrow ones, comparison
with the direct simulations shows reasonable agreement.

filled with photons at temperature T and investigate its localization and
interference properties. It is shown that the wave packet becomes localized and
the interference disappears with an exponential speed after a sufficiently long
path through the cavity.
