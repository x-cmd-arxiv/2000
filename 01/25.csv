successful models, and for a simple spherical BLR geometry we simulate the
emission line light curves for the 1989 {\em IUE} and 1993 {\em HST} campaigns,
using the respective observed UV continuum light curves as drivers. We find
good agreement between the predicted and observed light curves and lags --- a
demonstration of the LOC picture's viability as a means to understanding the

picture which involves the marriage of echo-mapping techniques with spectral
simulation grids such as those presented here, using the constraints provided
by a high quality, temporally well-sampled spectroscopic data set.

harder during a pointed observation although the count rate remained constant.

fainter and spectral fitting demonstrates that it is the hard component that is

the slope of which is rather flat compared with other NLS1s. Survey and

virial radius of the cluster (2 h^{-1} Mpc; Girardi et al. 1998), indicating

overestimated by ~20% without the BCG halo. Furthermore, the relatively red
color of the BCG at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidal
stripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly to
the halo luminosity. The color and the form of the profile are consistent with
a scenario in which the BCG forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch of
cluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 Gyrs
(Dubinski 1998). We remove the BCG and other detected galaxies from the image
and construct a two dimensional surface brightness map of the cluster core.
Several knots of excess emission are found, but the total diffuse component is

Spectra obtained at different dates when the source was in low states at a
comparable V magnitude, show the presence of strong Zeeman absorption features
and marked changes in emission lines with a day-to-day reappearance of the HeII
(4686\AA) emission lines in 1991. Despite this variability, the magnetic field
inferred from the fitting of the absorption spectrum with Zeeman hydrogen
splitting, is remarkably constant with a best value of (12.5$\pm$0.5)MG.
Detailed analysis of the UBVRI light curves shows the presence of repetitive
moderate amplitude ($\sim$ 0.3-0.5 mag) flares predominantly red in colour.
These flares are attributed to small accretion events and are compared to the
large ($\sim$ 2 mag.) blue flare reported by Shakhovskoy et al. (1993). We
suggest that the general flaring activity observed during the low states is
generated by accretion events. The different characteristics of the flares
(colour and polarization) are the results of different shock geometries
depending on the net mass accretion flux.

with remote astrophysical loads, the rotational energy of the black hole can be
extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Due to the rotation of the
black hole, the magnetic field lines are twisted and toroidal components are
generated. So poloidal electric currents are induced and the black hole's
rotational energy is transported to the astrophysical loads through Poynting
flux. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has been considered to be a possible
process for powering extragalactic jets.
  In this paper we show that due to the screw instability of magnetic field,
the toroidal components of the magnetic field, and thus the poloidal currents,
cannot exceed the limits given by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. This
significantly lowers the power of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism when the loads
are far from the black hole. So the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can only work
efficiently within the neighborhood of the black hole. The implications of the
results for the scenario of extragalactic jets powered by the Blandford-Znajek
mechanism are discussed.

1.6arcsec are the central parts of inclined, rotating disk galaxies with equal
mass bulges. The dynamical masses of the nuclei are much larger than the
stellar mass derived from the K-band light, implying that the progenitor
galaxies were galaxies with massive bulges. The K-band light is dominated by
red supergiants formed in the two nuclei in starbursts, triggered ~2x10^7 years
ago, possibly by the most recent perigalactic approach. Strong feedback effects
of a superwind and supernovae are responsible for a short duration burst
(~5x10^6 years) which is already decaying. The two galaxies form a
prograde-retrograde rotating system and from the stellar velocity field it
seems that one of the two interacting galaxies is subject to a prograde
encounter. Between the stellar nuclei is a prominent peak of molecular gas
(H_2, CO). The stellar velocity dispersion peaks there indicating that the gas
has formed a local, self-gravitating concentration decoupled from the stellar
gravitational potential. NGC 6240 has previously been reported to fit the
paradigm of an elliptical galaxy formed through the merger of two galaxies.
This was based on the near-infrared light distribution which follows a
r^1/4-law. Our data cast strong doubt on this conclusion: the system is by far
not relaxed, rotation plays an important role, as does self-gravitating gas,
and the near-infrared light is dominated by young stars.

the stochastic series expansion method (a cluster algorithm for sampling the
diagonal matrix elements of the power series expansion of ${\rm exp}(-\beta H)$
to all orders). The solution relies on identification of operator-loops which
change the configuration sign when updated (``merons'') and is similar to the
meron-cluster algorithm recently proposed by Chandrasekharan and Wiese for
solving the sign problem for a class of fermion models (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf

definition of a bubble as a self-fulfilling reinforcing price change, we
identify indicators of a possible self-reinforcing imitation between agents in
the market. We show that during the build-up phase of a bubble, there is a
growing interest in the public for the commodity in question, whether it
consists in stocks, diamonds or coins. That interest can be estimated through
different indicators: increase in the number of books published on the topic,
increase in the subscriptions to specialized journals. Moreover, the well-known
empirical rule according to which the volume of sales is growing during a bull
market finds a natural interpretation in this framework: sales increases in
fact reveal and pinpoint the progress of the bubble's diffusion throughout
society. We also present a simple model of rational expectation which maps
exactly onto the Ising model on a random graph. The indicators are then
interpreted as ``thermometers'', measuring the balance between idiosyncratic
information (noise temperature) and imitation (coupling) strength. In this
context, bubbles are interpreted as low or critical temperature phases, where
the imitation strength carries market prices up essentially independently of
fundamentals. Contrary to the naive conception of a bubble and a crash as times
of disorder, on the contrary, we show that bubbles and crashes are times where
the concensus is too strong.

a function of temperature and hole doping. The results allow to identify
different physical regimes. Near half-filling we find an anomalous `Hubbard-I
phase', where the band structure is, up to some minor modifications, consistent
with the Hubbard-I predictions. At lower temperatures, where the spin response
becomes sharp, additional dispersionless `bands' emerge due to the dressing of
electrons/holes with spin excitatons. We present a simple phenomenological fit
which reproduces the band structure of the insulator quantitatively. The Fermi
surface volume in the low doping phase, as derived from the single-particle
spectral function, is not consistent with the Luttinger theorem, but
qualitatively in agreement with the predictions of the Hubbard-I approximation.
The anomalous phase extends up to a hole concentration of 15%, i.e. the
underdoped region in the phase diagram of high-T_c superconductors. We also

rather by a (spectroscopically invisible) band of spin 3/2 quasiparticles. We

constraint equations, corresponding to systems composed of two black holes with
arbitrary linear and angular momentum. The analytical nature of these initial
data solutions makes them easier to implement in numerical evolutions than the
traditional numerical approach of solving the elliptic equations derived from
the Einstein constraints. Although in general the problem of setting up initial
conditions for black hole binary simulations is complicated by the presence of
singularities, we show that the methods presented in this work provide initial
data with $l_1$ and $l_\infty$ norms of violation of the constraint equations
falling below those of the truncation error (residual error due to
discretization) present in finite difference codes for the range of grid
resolutions currently used. Thus, these data sets are suitable for use in
evolution codes. Detailed results are presented for the case of a head-on
collision of two equal-mass M black holes with specific angular momentum 0.5M
at an initial separation of 10M. A straightforward superposition method yields
data adequate for resolutions of $h=M/4$, and an ""attenuated"" superposition
yields data usable to resolutions at least as fine as $h=M/8$. In addition, the
attenuated approximate data may be more tractable in a full (computational)
exact solution to the initial value problem.

is examined in the thin wall approximation: modeling the interior false vacuum
as a region of de Sitter space; the exterior as an asymptotically flat region
of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometry; and the boundary separating the two as a
charged domain wall. There remains only to determine how the wall gets embedded
in these two geometries. In this approximation, the ratio $k$ of the false
vacuum to surface energy densities is a measure of the symmetry breaking scale
$\eta$. Solutions are characterized by this ratio, the charge on the wall $Q$,
and the value of the conserved total energy $M$. We find that for each fixed
$k$ and $Q$ up to some critical value, there exists a unique globally static
solution, with $M\simeq Q^{3/2}$; any stable radial excitation has $M$ bounded
above by $Q$, the value assumed in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometry
and these are the only solutions with $M<Q$. As $M$ is raised above $Q$ a black
hole forms in the exterior: (i) for low $Q$ or $k$, the wall is crushed; (ii)
for higher values, it oscillates inside the black hole. If the mass is not too
high these `collapsing' solutions co-exist with an inflating bounce; (iii) for
$k$, $Q$ or $M$ outside the above regimes, there is a unique inflating
solution. In case (i) the course of the bounce lies within a single
asymptotically flat region (AFR) and it resembles closely the bounce exhibited
by a false vacuum bubble (with Q=0). In cases (ii) and (iii) the course of the

the power spectrum of the boundary velocity, the variance decays exponentially
for distances larger than a Stokes layer thickness based on the cut-off
frequency. Vibration of a gently curved boundary results in steady streaming in
the ensemble average of the tangential velocity. Its amplitude diverges
logarithmically with distance away from the boundary, but asymptotes to a
constant value instead if a low frequency cut-off is considered. This steady
component of the velocity is shown to depend logarithmically on the cut-off
frequency. Finally, we consider the case of a periodically modulated solid
boundary that is being randomly vibrated. We find steady streaming in the
ensemble average of the first order velocity, with flow extending up to a
characteristic distance of the order of the boundary wavelength. The structure
of the flow in the vicinity of the boundary depends strongly on the correlation
time of the boundary velocity.

the isoelectronium is stable; 2) the effective size of the isoelectronium is

the restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady approach to $H_2$ is capable to fit
the experimental binding energy, at the isoelectronium mass parameter
$M=0.308381m_e$, although under optimal internuclear distance about 19.6%

energy-based estimation of the weight of the isoelectronium phase which is

that this is {\it not} the result corresponding to the original
Santilli-Shillady model, which is based on the Hulten potential $V_h$. An
interesting result is that in order to prevent divergency of the Coloumb
integral for $V_h$ the correlation length parameter $r_c$ should run discrete
set of values. We used this condition in our $V_e$-based model.

initio} relativistic method, which combines the configuration interaction
method with many-body perturbation theory. It was found that the silver atom
forms a bound state with a positron with binding energy 123 ($\pm$ 20%) meV,
while the gold atom cannot bind a positron. Our calculations reveal the
importance of the relativistic effects for positron binding to heavy atoms. The
role of these effects was studied by varying the value of the fine structure
constant $\alpha$. In the non-relativistic limit, $\alpha = 0$, both systems
$e^+$Ag and $e^+$Au are bound with binding energies of about 200 meV for
$e^+$Ag and 220 meV for $e^+$Au. Relativistic corrections for a negative ion
are essentially different from that for a positron interacting with an atom.
Therefore, the calculation of electron affinities cannot serve as a test of the
method used for positron binding in the non-relativistic case. However, it is
still a good test of the relativistic calculations. Our calculated electron
affinities for silver (1.327 eV) and gold (2.307 eV) atoms are in very good
agreement with corresponding experimental values (1.303 eV and 2.309 eV
respectively).

inversion is the key to explain this shape generically. A parity adapted
Hamiltonian reduces from ten to two terms. The analytical perturbed Coulomb
function scales attractive and repulsive branches of 13 PECs (HH, HF, LiH, KH,
AuH, LiLi, LiF, KLi, NaCs, RbRb,RbCs, CsCs and II) in a single straight line.
Turning points are reproduced with a deviation of 0.3 % (0.007 angstrom). At
the repulsive side, the deviation is 0.2 % (0.003 angstrom). The ab initio zero
molecular parameter function gives PECs of acceptable quality, just using
atomic ionisation energies. The function can be used as a model potential for
inverting energy levels. The theory may be tested with femtochemistry.
Reactions between hydrogen and anti-hydrogen, feasible in the near future, will
probably produce normal HH.
