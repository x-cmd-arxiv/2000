improved sky and LOS velocities for >100 stars within a few arcsec of SgrA*.
Overall the motions do not deviate strongly from isotropy. For 32 stars with
all 3 components determined the absolute, LOS and sky velocities agree well, as
for a spherical cluster. The projected radial and tangential motions of all 104
pm stars are also consistent with overall isotropy. However, the projected
velocities of the young, early type stars have a strong radial dependence. Most
of the bright HeI stars 1-10"" from SgrA* are on tangential orbits. This
anisotropy of the HeI stars and most of the brighter IRS16 complex members is
largely caused by a CW and counter-rotating, coherent rotation pattern. The
overall rotation of the young star cluster probably is a remnant of the angular
momentum in the cloud these stars formed from. The fainter, fast stars within
\~1"" of SgrA* appear to be largely moving on radial or very elliptical orbits.
We have not detected nonlinear motion for any of them. Most of the SgrA*
cluster members also are on CW orbits. Spectroscopy shows them to be early type
stars. We propose that the SgrA* cluster stars are those members of the early
type cluster with small angular momentum which can plunge to the vicinity of
SgrA*. Our anisotropy-independent estimate of the Sun-GC distance is 7.8-8.2
kpc (+/- 0.9 kpc). We include velocity anisotropy in estimating the central
mass distribution. We confirm previous conclusions that a compact central mass
concentration is present and dominates the potential from 0.01-1 pc. The
central mass ranges from 2.6-3.3E6 M_sun. (abridged)

background (CMB) caused by relativistic plasma. Within the Thomson regime, an
exact analytic expression for the photon scattering kernel of a momentum
power-law electron distribution is given. The ultra-relativistic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) decrement measures the electron number and not the
energy content. On the other hand, the relativistic SZ increment at higher
frequencies depends strongly on the spectral shape of the electrons. We
calculate the expected Comptonization due to the energy release of radio
galaxies, which we estimate to be 3 10^66 erg Gpc^-3. We investigate
Comptonization from (a) the part of the released energy which is thermalized
and (b) the relativistic, remnant radio plasma, which may form a second,
relativistic phase in the inter galactic medium, nearly unobservable for
present day instruments (presence of so called 'radio ghosts'). We find a
thermal Comptonization parameter due to (a) of y = 10^-6 and (b) an optical
depth of relativistic electrons in old radio plasma of tau_rel < 10^-7. If a
substantial fraction of the volume of clusters of galaxies is filled with such
old radio plasma the SZ effect based determination of the Hubble constant is
biased to lower values. Finally, it is shown that a supra-thermal population of
electrons in the Coma cluster would produce a signature in the Wien-tail of the
CMB, which is marginally detectable with a multifrequency measurement by the
Planck satellite. Such a population is expected to exist, since its
bremsstrahlung would explain Coma's recently reported high energy X-ray excess.

well-populated evolutionary stages, they are also less affected by theoretical
uncertainties and by the ubiquitous effect of stochastic colour dispersion. The
latter effects become important for the V-K colour. Thus, we argue that U-B and

clusters. For other potentially useful colours like V-R and V-I, empirical
tests of their evolution are still missing.

The 9M CMD reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicity
stellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over
3 orders of magnitude in number density. First, we count the non-variable
supergiants, the associated Cepheids, and measure the effective temperatures
defining the instability strip. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution
theory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity Cepheids.
The highly-evolved AGB stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, which
we interpret as discrete old populations (>1 Gyr). The faint AGB may be
metal-poor and very old. We identify the clusters NGC 411 and M3 as templates
for the admixture of old stellar populations. However, there are indications
that the old and metal-poor field population has a red HB morphology: the RR
Lyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the AGB-bump is very red,
and the ratio of AGB-bump stars to RR Lyraes is quite large. If the HB second
parameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed after
the oldest clusters. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead us
to associate a significant fraction of the red HB clump giants with the same
old and metal-poor population producing the RR Lyraes and the AGB-bump. In this
case, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolution
theory, the red HB clump is too bright relative to the RR Lyraes and AGB-bump.
Last, the surface density profile of RR Lyraes is fit by an exponential,
favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. We conclude that the
age of the LMC disk is probably similar to the age of the Galactic disk.

aligned with that of the black hole. We focus on the parameter regime where the
warp dynamics are controlled by bending wave propagation, but also consider
models in which warps are subject to diffusion rather than wave transport, and
are able to consider the fully nonlinear regime. Because of hydrodynamic or
pressure effects, for the parameter range investigated, the transition radius
is always found to be much smaller than that obtained by Bardeen & Petterson
(1975). For discs with midplane Mach numbers of about 10, the transition occurs
between 10 - 16 gravitational radii, whereas for a Mach number of about 30 it
occurs at around 30 gravitational radii. A thicker disc with a Mach number of 5
is found to produce no discernible warped structure. The rate of black hole -
disc alignment is found to be consistent with the ideas of Ress (1978), with
the alignment torque behaving as if it arises from the accreted material
transferring its misaligned component of angular momentum at the larger
transition radius of Bardeen & Petterson (1975). The inclusion of Einstein
precession in the calculations modified both the warped disc structure and,
consistent with linear analysis, produced an increased alignment rate by up to

spherical accretion flows. High temperature PADAF flows can exist above the
critical mass accretion rate in addition to the usual cold thin disk solutions.
We also find solutions where the flow near the equatorial plane accretes
normally while the flow near the pole is overheated by Compton preheating,
possibly becoming, a polar wind, solutions which we designate WADAF.

blueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to V_sys) which is
recognized as a distinct C-shape distortion in the velocity field around the
southern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 km
s^-1 with respect to V_sys), and the component indicating possible line
splitting of ~500 km s^-1. The latter two components are extended to the south
from the southern nucleus. We show that the kinematic properties of these three
components can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structure
around the southern nucleus. The offset peak position of the H_2 emission can
be understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts with
the extragalactic molecular gas. At the interface between the shell and the
molecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by Cowie et
al. (1981) may work efficiently, and the intense H_2 emission is thus expected
there. All these findings lead us to propose a model that the most H_2 emission

interacting electron liquid sandwiched between two superconductors are
re-examined. We first present some apparently new results on the
non-interacting case by studying an exactly solvable tight-binding model rather
than the usual continuum model. We show that perfect Andreev scattering (i.e.
zero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning
junction parameters. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current,
which is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference
except when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev
scattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that,
even when interactions are included, all low energy properties of a junction
(E<<\Delta, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by ""integrating out"" the
superconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the
metallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary
model provides a suitable starting point for bosonization/renormalization
group/boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal
reflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the
boundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev
fixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true
for attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian
(without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed
point for repulsive interactions but to the Andreev one for attractive
interactions. An exact mapping of our tight-binding model to the Hubbard model
with a transverse magnetic field is used to help understand this behavior.

present an exact calculation of spin clustering applicable to arbitrary
distributions of magnetic spins in the growth direction. The results reveal a
surprising insensitivity of the magnetization to the form of the intermixing
profile, and identify important limits on the maximum possible magnetization.
High-field optical studies of heterostructures containing ""quasi-2D"" spin
distributions are compared with calculation.

No calculations using 'advanced' operations like multiplication, division,

construction of roots of polynomials to arbitrary accuracy using only a
straight edge, a compass, and pencils of 2m different colors. In particular,
the ancient problem of the ""doubling of cube"" is soluble asymptotically by the

construction using only a straight edge and compass in a finite number of

associated an m-term recurrence relation for generating integer sequences. A
set of m such sequences, which together exhibit interesting properties related
to the roots of the polynomial, can be obtained if the m initial terms of each
of these m sequences is chosen in a special way using a matrix associated with

degenerate at the $E^2$ term. For arbitrary ground rings we prove here (Theorem

of subsets of a space $M$ with two closures which are closed in the first
closure and open in the other. As a space $M$ for this representation an
algebraic dual space $P^*$ was used. Here we extend the theory of algabraic
duality for posets generalizing the notion of an ideal. This approach yields a
sufficient condition for the collection of clopen subsets of a subset of $P^*$
(with respect to induced closures) to be isomorphic to $P$. Applying this
result to certain classes of posets we prove some representation theorems and
get a topological characterization of orthocomplementations.

an explicit example using tree level amplitudes for N photon production in
which a Boltzmann-like distribution is obtained without any equilibration. We
argue that the failure of statistical techniques based on free particle
ensembles may provide a signal for collective phenomena (such as large shifts
in masses and widths of resonances) related to the QCD phase transition.

derived from the liquid drop model under the assumption that the aligned
configuration, with the emitted particle between the light and heavy fragment
is obtained by increasing continuously the separation distance, while the radii
of the light fragment and of the light particle are kept constant. During the
first stage of the deformation one has a two-center evolution until the neck
radius becomes equal to the radius of the emitted particle. Then the three
center starts developing by decreasing with the same amount the two tip
distances. In such a way a second minimum, typical for a cluster molecule,
appears in the deformation energy. Examples are presented for $^{240}$Pu parent
nucleus emitting $\alpha$-particles and $^{14}$C in a ternary process.
