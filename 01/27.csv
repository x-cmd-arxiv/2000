shape that depends only weakly on the incident energy flux and the distance
from the accreting compact object. It consists of a `blue bump' of
unComptonized soft photons and a flat high energy tail, reminiscent of the
observed spectra. The hard tail becomes flatter as the thermalization depth in
the cool disk is increased. Further evidence for ion illumination are the Li

thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems,
being caused by central carbon ignition when the white dwarf approaches the
Chandrasekhar mass. As the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate,
characterized by high Fermi energies for the high density regions in the

important role in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central
electron fraction Y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from such
explosions. Up to the present, astrophysical tabulations based on shell model
matrix elements were only available for light nuclei in the sd-shell. Recently
new Shell Model Monte Carlo (SMMC) and large-scale shell model diagonalization

we demonstrate that the CRI model is energetically untenable. We present
evolutionary trends for B-11/B-10 and B/Be which, combined with future

We show that delayed LiBeB synthesis in the CRS model, due to the transport of
the cosmic rays, could explain why log(Be/H) is steeper vs. [O/H] than vs.
[Fe/H]. We also show that delayed deposition of Fe into star forming regions,

for the possible rise of [O/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H]. Observations of
refractory and volatile alpha-elements could test this scenario. There seems to

provides one possibility to soften the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star
matter at high densities. This softening leads to more compact equilibrium
configurations of neutron stars compared to pure hadronic stars of the same
mass. We investigate the question to which amount the compactness of a neutron
star can be attributed to the presence of a quark phase. For this purpose we
employ several hadronic EOS in the framework of the relativistic mean-field
(RMF) model and an extended MIT bag model to describe the quark phase. We find
that - almost independent of the model parameters - the radius of a pure
hadronic neutron star gets typically reduced by 20-30% if a pure quark phase in
the center of the star does exist. For some EOS we furthermore find the
possibility of a ""third family"" of compact stars which may exist besides the
two known families of white dwarfs and neutron stars. We show how an
experimental proof of the existence of a third family by mass and radius
measurements may provide a unique signature for a phase transition inside

means of a Monte Carlo method applied to the Press-Schechter mass function. The
halos are assumed to have a NFW density profile, in agreement with recent

the peak of the N(m) curve, located at AB approx 30(31) for SCDM(LCDM) in J and
K wavelength bands and detect (75%, 51%) of the above SN events. This will
allow a detailed study of the early cosmic star formation history, as traced by
SNIIe. N(m) is only very mildly affected by the inclusion of lensing effects.

cosmological parameters from Hubble diagrams, when these are pushed to higher
$z$. For example, for a ``true'' LCDM with (Omega_M= 0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6),
without proper account of GL, one would instead derive

pc radius around SN1987A, based on an analysis of multi-band HST-WFPC2 images.
  The effective temperature, radius and, possibly, reddening of each star were
determined for 21,955 stars by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes to
the ones calculated with model atmospheres. In addition, we have identified all
stars with Halpha equivalent widths in excess of 8 A, amounting to a total of
492 stars.
  An inspection to the HR diagram reveals the presence of several generations
of young stars, with ages between 1 and 150 Myrs, superposed on a much older
field population (0.6-6 Gyrs). A substantial fraction of young stars have ages
around 12 Myrs which is the stellar generation coeval to SN 1987A progenitor.
The youngest stars in the field appear to be strong-line T Tauri stars. This
constitute the first positive detection of low mass (about 1-2 Mo) Pre Main
Sequence (PMS) stars outside the Milky Way. Their positions in the HR diagram
appear to require that star formation in the LMC occurs with accretion rates
about 10 times higher than in the Milky Way, i.e. ~10^{-4} Mo/yr.
  SN1987A appears to belong to a loose, young cluster 12+/-2 Myrs old, in which
the slope of the present mass function is almost identical to Salpeter's for
masses above 3 Mo, but becomes much flatter for lower masses. On a large scale,
we find that the spatial distribution of massive stars and low-mass PMS stars
are conclusively different. This results casts doubts on the validity of an IMF
concept on a small scale (say, less than 10 pc). A preliminary analysis, done
for the whole field as a single entity, shows that the IMF slope for the young
population present over the entire region is steeper than Gamma ~ -1.7.

collective properties. In this way we are simulating the dissipationless merger
of the Local Group, into presumably an elliptical galaxy. Such a merger is
dominated by the Milky Way and M31, which appear to be fairly typical examples
of globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies.
  The Local Group `Elliptical' has about 700 +/- 125 globular clusters, with a
luminosity function resembling the `universal' one. The metallicity
distribution has peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.55 and -0.64 with a metal-poor to
metal-rich ratio of 2.5:1. The specific frequency of the Local Group Elliptical
is initially about 1 but rises to about 3, when the young stellar populations
fade and the galaxy resembles an old elliptical. The metallicity distribution
and stellar population corrected specific frequency are similar to that of some
known early type galaxies. Based on our results, we briefly speculate on the
origin of globular cluster systems in galaxies.

  report received on Oct 21, re-submitted on Dec 10",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We show that recently published assertions that advection dominated accretion
flows (ADAFs) require the presence of strong winds are unfounded because they
assume that low radiative efficiency in flows accreting at low rates onto black
holes implies vanishing radial energy and angular momentum fluxes through the
flow (which is also formulated in terms of the `Bernoulli function' being
positive). This, however, is a property only of self-similar solutions which
are an inadequate representation of global accretion flows. We recall general
properties of accretion flows onto black holes and show that such, necessarily
transonic, flows may have either positive or negative Bernoulli function
depending on the flow viscosity. Flows with low viscosities (alpha<0.1 in the
alpha-viscosity model) have a negative Bernoulli function. Without exception,
all 2-D and 1-D numerical models of low viscosity flows constructed to date
experience no significant outflows. At high viscosities the presence of
outflows depends on the assumed viscosity, the equation of state and on the
outer boundary condition. The positive sign of the Bernoulli function invoked
in this context is irrelevant to the presence of outflows. As an illustration,
we recall 2-D numerical models with moderate viscosity that have positive
values of the Bernoulli function and experience no outflows. ADAFs, therefore,
do not differ from this point of view from thin Keplerian discs: they may have,
but they do not have to have strong winds.

estimated 40 trials the significance is 2.4-sigma. Besides the kilohertz QPOs,
the Fourier power spectra show four additional components: high frequency noise
(HFN), described by a broken power-law with a break frequency between 0.7 and
45 Hz, very low frequency noise (VLFN), which is fitted as a power-law below 1

changes in the orientation of the current near $\phi=0$. We call this
phenomenon orientational pinning. This leads to a finite transverse critical
current for a bias at $\phi=0$ and to a transverse voltage for a bias at
$\phi\not=0$. On the other hand, for diagonal bias in the [11] direction the
behavior is highly unstable against small variations of $\phi$, leading to a
rapid change from zero transverse voltage to a large transverse voltage within
a few degrees. This last behavior is in good agreement with our measurements in

""exotic"" properties, such as ""trapping"" of geodesics and closed causal curves
through every point. The possibility that such spacetimes could be generated by
a superconducting string, endowed with a neutral current and momentum, has
recently been considered by Thatcher and Morgan. Our results, however, differ
from those found by Thatcher and Morgan, and the discrepancy is explained. We
also analyze the general possibility of constructing physical sources for the
exotic metrics, and find that, under certain restrictions, they must always
violate the dominant energy condition (DEC). We illustrate our results by
explicitly analyzing the case of concentric shells, where we find that in all
cases the external vacuum metric is non exotic if the matter in the shells
satisfies the DEC.

coherent} string states, which generalize the ordinary coherent states of
quantum mechanics, and show that in the classical limit they correspond to
oscillating circular strings. After quantization, the spectrum is found to
consist of two parts: A continuous spectrum of low mass states (partly
tachyonic) fulfilling the standard spin-level condition necessary for unitarity
|j|< k/2, and a discrete spectrum of high mass states with asymptotic behaviour
m^2\alpha'\propto N^2 (N positive integer). The quantization condition for the
high mass states arises from the condition of finite positive norm of the
coherent string states, and the result agrees with our previous results
obtained using semi-classical quantization. In the k\to\infty limit, all the
usual properties of coherent or {\it quasi-classical} states are recovered. It
should be stressed that we consider the circular strings only for simplicity
and clarity, and that our construction can easily be used for other string
configurations too. We also compare our results with those obtained in the

over operads. Free resolutions (constructed via Boardman-Vogt approach) are
used in order to describe formal moduli spaces of deformations. We apply the
general theory to the proof of Deligne's conjecture. The latter says that the
Hochschild complex of an associative algebra carries a canonical structure of a
dg-algebra over the chain operad of the little discs operad. In the course of
the proof we construct an operad of geometric nature which acts on the
Hochschild complex. It seems to be different from the brace operad (the latter
was used in the previous approaches to the Deligne's conjecture). It follows
from our results that the Grothendieck-Teichm\""uller group acts (homotopically)
on the moduli space of structures of 2-algebras on the Hochschild complex. In
the Appendix we develop a theory of piecewise algebraic chains and forms. It is
suitable for real semialgebraic manifolds with corners (like Fulton-Macpherson
compactifications of the configuration spaces of points).

second kind or turbulent equilibrium is shown to exist under tertiary molecular
chaos hypothesis to replace the classical binary chaos by Boltzmann. It is
expressed as bimodal Maxwellians each mode differing by plus/minus
root-mean-squares of fluctuations in macroscopic variables. Chemical reaction
rates calculated using the turbulent-equilibrium are obtained in a closed form,
accounting for discrepancy between experiments and classical theory based on
Arrhenius' law that underestimates the burning rate considerably. The key issue
is the correct estimation of the high-energy tail of the distribution function
that is minor in population, yet playing a major role for reactions with high
activation energy. It is extremely sensitive to turbulence level in the
temperature, causing slightly subcritical molecules to clear the potential
barrier to cause reactions just like quantum particles undergoing tunnelling
effect owing to the uncertainty principle. Variance of the fluctuating
turbulent chemical reaction rate is also calculated, verifying that relative
variance based on the turbulent equilibrium is low, whereas its classical
counterpart (Arrhenius) is pathologically high. A closed set of equations
governing reactive turbulent gases is presented on this sound basis.

describe the forced stochastically diverse circular oscillation motion, created
by force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl's elementary electric
charge with the electric intensity of the resultant quantum electromagnetic
field of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of Abraham-Lorentz equation.
By dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line of a classical
macro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated lines,
owing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on
the StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse
circular oscillations with stochastically various radii are moving along this
short disordered line. These circular oscillations lie within the flats,
perpendicular to same disordered short line, along which are moving its
centers. In a result of same forced circular oscillation motion the smooth thin
line of the LrEl is roughly spread and turned out into some cylindrically wide
path of the SchEl. Hence the dispersions of different dynamical parameters,
determining the state of the SchEl, which are results of its continuously
interaction with the resultant quantum electromagnetic field of the
