Although there is no evidence for any broad line-like emissions in the MeV

above several hundred keV. In particular, the spectrum at MeV energies can be
described as a power-law with a photon spectral index of $\alpha$ = -3.2, with
no evidence for a cutoff at high energies. For the 200 keV to 5 MeV spectrum,
we provide a quantitative description of the underlying electron spectrum, in
the context of a hybrid thermal/non-thermal model for the emission. The
electron spectrum can be described by a thermal Maxwellian with a temperature
of $kT_e$ = 86 keV and a non-thermal power-law component with a spectral index

its canonical low X-ray state (as measured at energies below 10 keV), covering
the energy range from 50 keV to 5 MeV. Here we report on a comparison of this
spectrum to a COMPTEL-OSSE spectrum collected during a high X-ray state of
Cygnus X-1 (May, 1996). These data provide evidence for significant spectral
variability at energies above 1 MeV. In particular, whereas the hard X-ray flux
{\it decreases} during the high X-ray state, the flux at energies above 1 MeV
{\it increases}, resulting in a significantly harder high energy spectrum. This

current microlensing searches suffer from large uncertainties caused by
blending effect. To measure light variations of microlensing events free from
the effect of blending, a newly developed method of Differential Image Analysis
(DIA) was proposed for microlensing searches. However, even with the light
variation curve obtained by using the DIA method, dramatic reduction of the
uncertainty in the determined Einstein time scale is not expected due to the
difficulty in determining the baseline flux of a source star.
  However, we show in this paper that if the blending effect is investigated by
detecting the shift of a source star image centroid, the DIA method will allow
one to detect the blending effect with a significantly enhanced efficiency
compared the efficiency of the current method based on PSF photometry (PSF
method). This is because for a given event the centroid shift measurable by
using the DIA method, $\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}$, is {\it always} larger than
the centroid shift measurable by using the PSF method, $\delta\theta_{\rm
c,PSF}$. We find that the ratio $\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}/\delta\theta_{\rm
c,DIA}$ rapidly increases with increasing fraction of blended light. In
addition, for events affected by the same fraction of blended light, the ratio
$\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}/ \delta \theta_{\rm c,DIA}$ is larger for the event
with a lower amplification. Therefore, centroid shift measurements by using the
DIA method will be an efficient method to detect the blending effect especially
of highly blended events, for which the uncertainties in the determined
Einstein time scale are large, as well as of low amplification events, for
which the current method is highly inefficient.

The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations
betwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that
such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the
results of N-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreases
with the halo mass.
  Galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pair
weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as
predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. In this case the
resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to the
observed. Such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clustering
compared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the CDM models with
the data. Generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale dependent and
nonmonotonic. For red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may be
scale dependent even on very large scales.
  Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed
through the galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply
as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses
dominate at different scales and because larger halos host more than one
galaxy. We discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination

group center than the non-emission line giants. This last result indicates that
the dwarfs and giants occupy different orbits (i.e., have not mixed completely)

that the shape of the GLF varies with environment and that this variation is
due primarily to an increase in the dwarf-to-giant ratio of quiescent galaxies

reference to B1608+656. The multi-band images are de-reddened, de-convolved and
de-contaminated so that the luminous matter and the surface brightness contours

solar ``nanoflares'' to cosmological gamma ray bursts, supernovae and the
protracted intervals of nuclear activity that produce the giant quasars and
radio galaxies. There are many parallels in the analyses of the explosion sites
that are highlighted at this workshop, specifically stellar coronae, accretion

although the details remain controversial. Ultrarelativistic jets may be formed
by the spinning hole and collimated by a hydromagnetic disc wind. Progress in
understanding jets has been handicapped by our inadequate knowledge of how

insights are coming from solar observations, numerical simulation and

while other parts are quadruply-imaged. The distortions of the host galaxy
offer the best probe yet of the global structure of the lensing potential,

delay. The distortions are inconsistent with the predictions of previously
published lens models, which invalidates those models and their implications
for H_0. New models show that the distortions finally break the long-standing
degeneracy between the shape of the lens galaxy and the tidal shear contributed
by the cluster containing the lens galaxy. The shape of the lens galaxy's mass
distribution must be remarkably similar to the shape of its luminosity
distribution, and most models that produce reasonable values for the Hubble
constant roughly match the observed ellipticity gradient and isophote twist of
the lens galaxy. Also, the cluster must be non-spherical and produce a
relatively small tidal shear. Although there are still degeneracies in the lens
models that lead to a 25% uncertainty in the derived value of the Hubble
constant, there are also strong prospects for new observations to further
improve the constraints and reduce the uncertainties.

assumption of quasi-continuous jet ejection. The jets are `lit up' by shock
fronts traveling along the jets during outbursts. The observed comparatively
flat decay light curves combined with gradually steepening spectral slopes are
explained by a superposition of the radiation of the aging relativistic
particle population left behind by the shocks. This scenario is the low energy,
time-resolved equivalent to the internal shock model for GRBs. We show that
this model predicts energy contents of the radiating plasma similar to the
plasmon model. At the same time, the jet model relaxes the severe requirements
on the central source in terms of the rate at which this energy must be
supplied to the jet. Observations of `mini-bursts' with flat spectral slopes
and of infrared emission far from the source centre suggest two different
states of jet ejections: (i) A `mini-burst' mode with relatively stable jet
production and weak radio emission with flat spectra and (ii) an outburst mode
with strong variations in the jet bulk velocities coupled with strong radio
emission with steeper spectra. We also show that the continuous jets in
microquasars should terminate in strong shocks and possibly inflate radio lobes
similar to extragalactic jet sources. Finally, we investigate the possibility
of testing the predictions of this model with resolved radio observations.

is a common mean observed radio luminosity from the black hole candidates
(BHCs) in the Low/Hard X-ray state and the neutron-star Z sources on the
horizontal X-ray branch. This implies a common mean intrinsic radio luminosity
to within a factor of twenty five (or less, if there is significant Doppler
boosting of the radio emission). Unless coincidental, these results imply a
physical mechanism for jet formation which requires neither a black hole event
horizon or a neutron star surface. As a whole the populations of Atoll and
X-ray pulsar systems are less luminous by factors of >5 and >10 at radio
wavelengths than the BHCs and Z sources (while some Atoll sources have been
detected, no high-field X-ray pulsar has ever been reliably detected as a radio
source). We suggest that all of the persistent BHCs and the Z sources generate,
at least sporadically, an outflow with physical dimensions > 1e12cm, i.e.
significantly larger than the binary separations of most of the systems. We
compare the physical conditions of accretion in each of the types of persistent
X-ray binary and conclude that a relatively low (<1e10 G) magnetic field
associated with the accreting object, and a high (>0.1 Eddington) accretion
rate and/or dramatic physical change in the accretion flow, are required for
formation of a radio-emitting outflow or jet.

velocity of the gas, which provides an independent constraint on the
gravitational potential.
  To interpret the stellar motions, we build axisymmetric three-integral
dynamical models based on an extension of the Schwarzschild orbit-
superposition technique. We consider two families of gravitational potential,
one in which the mass follows the light (i.e. no dark matter) and one with a
logarithmic gravitational potential. Using chi^2-statistics, we compare our
models to both the stellar and gas data to constrain the value of the V-band
mass-to-light ratio Upsilon-V. We find Upsilon-V = 15.0 \pm 0.6 h75 for the
mass-follows-light models and Upsilon-V = 17.0 \pm 0.7 h75 for the logarithmic
models. For the latter, Upsilon-V is defined within a sphere of 15'' radius.
  Models with radially constant Upsilon-V and logarithmic models with dark
matter provide comparably good fits to the data and possess similar dynamical
structure. Across the full range of Upsilon-V permitted by the observational
constraints, the models are radially anisotropic in the equatorial plane over
the radial range of our kinematical data (1'' < r < 40''). Along the true minor

strong-coupling bandwidth of order J (for the NN hopping model) and band gap of
order U, a non-zero critical interaction strength (above which the band gap
opens) only if same sublattice hopping (e.g., NNN hopping) is also present, and
the correct integrated spectral weights (1/2 per spin) in each band for the
half-filled model. The effects of charge and spin fluctuations, including spin
twisting due to finite spin correlation length, are investigated with a static,
random approximation. A self-consistent evaluation of the disorder-averaged
self energy within the CPA is carried out numerically. Fluctuations activate
the hopping term at first order resulting in band broadening, and the
consequent decrease in the band gap with fluctuation strength is obtained for
several U values in two and three dimensions. We find that the band gap shrinks
to zero continuously, and subsequently the density of states N(0) between the
bands grows continuously, leading to a continuous metal-insulator transition.
For finite doping there is transfer of spectral weight between the Hubbard
bands, and a qualitative change in the nature of the quasiparticle band
dispersion, with an effective doping-induced hopping strength and bandwidth of
order xt.

from the first principles of the RG theory (under the assumption that the fixed

asymptotic expansion of the two-point correlation (Green's) function. It is
demonstrated clearly that, within the framework of the standard methods (well
justified in the vicinity of the fixed point) used in the perturbative RG
theory, this equation leads to an unremovable contradiction with the known RG
results. Thus, in its very basics, the RG field theory in 4-epsilon dimensions
is contradictory. To avoid the contradiction, we conclude that such a
non-Gaussian fixed point, as predicted by the RG field theory, does not exist.
Our consideration does not exclude existence of a different fixed point.

that of the ideal triangular lattice are rejected. In this limit, we show that
the solid is stable against all other fluctuations at least upto densities as
low as $\rho \sigma^2 = 0.88$. Our system does not show any phase transition so
diverging correlation lengths leading to finite size effects and slow
relaxations do not exist. The dislocation pair formation probability is
estimated from the fraction of moves rejected due to the constraint which
yields, in turn, the core energy E_c and the (bare) dislocation fugacity y.
Using these quantities, we check the relative validity of first order and
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) melting scenarios and obtain
numerical estimates of the typical expected transition densities and pressures.
We conclude that a KTHNY transition from the solid to a hexatic phase preempts
the solid to liquid first order transition in this system albeit by a very
small margin, easily masked by crossover effects in unconstrained

lattice field theories for more than a decade. In this paper, we extend the
method to the dynamics of discrete particles moving in continuum. Although our
method is based on a mapping of the particles' dynamics to a regular grid so
that discrete Fourier transforms may be taken, it should be emphasized that the
introduction of the grid is a purely algorithmic device and that no smoothing,
coarse-graining or mean-field approximations are made. The method thus can be
applied to the equations of motion of molecular dynamics (MD), or its Langevin
or Brownian variants. For example, in Langevin MD simulations our acceleration
technique permits a straightforward spectral decomposition of forces so that
the long-wavelength modes are integrated with a longer time step, thereby
reducing the time required to reach equilibrium or to decorrelate the system in
equilibrium. Speedup factors of up to 30 are observed relative to pure
(unaccelerated) Langevin MD. As with acceleration of critical lattice models,
even further gains relative to the unaccelerated method are expected for larger
systems. Preliminary results for Fourier-accelerated molecular dynamics are
presented in order to illustrate the basic concepts. Possible extensions of the
method and further lines of research are discussed.

onset as a function of the container oscillation frequency f and amplitude A,
layer depth H, and grain diameter D. The primary transition from a flat grain
layer to standing waves occurs when the layer remains dilated after making
contact with the container. With a flat layer and increasing dimensionless peak
container acceleration G = 4 pi^2 f^2 A/g (g is the acceleration due to
gravity), the wave transition occurs for G=2.6, but with decreasing G the waves
persist to G=2.2. For 2.2<G<3.8, patterns are squares for f<f_ss and stripes
for f>f_ss; H determines the square/stripe transition frequency
f_ss=0.33(g/H)^0.5. The dispersion relations for layers with varying H collapse
onto the curve L/H=1.0+1.1[f(H/g)^0.5]^(-1.32 +/- 0.03) (L is the wavelength)
when the peak container velocity v exceeds a critical value v_gm of
approximately 3 (Dg)^0.5. Local collision pressure measurements suggest that
v_gm is associated with a transition in the horizontal grain mobility: for
v>v_gm, there is a hydrodynamic-like horizontal sloshing motion, while for
v<v_gm, the grains are essentially immobile and the stripe pattern apparently
arises from a bending of the granular layer. For f at v_gm less than f_ss and
v<v_gm, patterns are tenuous and disordered.

results when applied to multiple homogeneous soft modes. Dielectric
electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals is introduced as a model for
three-dimensional pattern formation. The 3D pattern dynamics including soft

reduced further to a two-dimensional one. It is argued that the range of

density the D-meson mass shift is about 10 times (\sim 50 MeV) larger than that

effective field theory of pions, nucleons and delta isobars, working to third
and second order in the small scale expansion respectively. Preceding
calculations in chiral effective field theories only employed pion and nucleon
degrees of freedom and were not able to reproduce the photon spectrum in the
pioneering experiment of radiative muon capture on the proton from TRIUMF. For
the past few years it has been speculated that the discrepancy between theory
and experiment might be due to Delta(1232) related effects, which are only
included via higher order contact interactions in the standard chiral approach.
In this report we demonstrate that this speculation does not hold true. We show
that contrary to expectations from naive dimensional analysis isobar effects on
the photon spectrum and the total rate in radiative muon capture are of the
order of a few percent, consistent with earlier findings in a more
phenomenological approach. We further demonstrate that both ordinary and
radiative muon capture constitute systems with a very well behaved chiral
expansion, both in standard chiral perturbation theory and in the small scale
expansion, and present some new ideas that might be at the bottom of the still
unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment in radiative muon capture.
Finally we comment upon the procedure employed by the TRIUMF group to extract
new information from their radiative muon capture experiment on the
pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon. We show that it is inconsistent with
the ordinary muon capture data.

adiabatic following condition for the general case of unequal oscillator
strengths. Exact analytical solutions to the propagation equations have been
obtained. It is shown that propagation dynamics strongly depends on the
relationship between oscillator strengths. The adiabaticity criterion for the
interaction of pulses with three-level media has been derived and analyzed in
detail.
