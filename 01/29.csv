controversial results regarding the performance of state-of-the-art model
atmospheres. The release of the homogeneous IUE final archive and the
availability of the high-accuracy Hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunity
to revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible to
compare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.
  The near-UV continuum is highly sensitive to Teff and [Fe/H], and once the
gravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived from
the analysis of low-dispersion ""long-wavelength"" (2000-3000 A) IUE spectra for
stars previously studied by Alonso et al. (1996; A&AS 117, 227) using the
Infrared Flux Method (IRFM). A second comparison is carried out against the
stars spectroscopically investigated by Gratton et al. (1996; A&A 314, 191). It
is shown that there is a good agreement between Teffs obtained from the IRFM
and from the near-UV continuum, and a remarkable correspondence between
observed and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 <= Teff <= 6000 K of any
metallicity and gravity. These facts suggest that model atmospheres provide an
adequate description of the near-UV continuum forming region and that the
opacities involved are essentially understood. For cooler stars, the results of
the IRFM are no longer reliable, as shown by Alonso et al., but the discrepancy
noticed for stars hotter than 6000 K may reflect problems in the model
atmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.

We show that synchrotron emission from electrons or positrons accelerated by

macroscopic motions present in this layer on the Sun's structure and evolution

this paper. A study of the locations, sizes, and physical characteristics of
local interstellar gas, i.e. ``astronephography,'' is included, and relies upon
the improved distance measurements provided by Hipparcos parallax measurements.
All spectra of more distant sight lines contain absorption features due to
intervening local gas, and more distant structures can only be studied
accurately if components due to the LISM have been isolated. Towards this end,
high resolution (R ~ 95,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 110 to 250) Na I
spectra of 11 nearby stars in the direction of Puppis-Vela have been obtained.
Toward Puppis-Vela, absorption due to the LIC was not observed, but components
at three distinct velocities were found, and the extent of the local gas
producing the features was estimated. The conclusions regarding the UV spectrum
of gamma^2 Vel presented by Fitzpatrick & Spitzer (1994) were re-examined in
light of this new LISM data, and the ambiguity in their conclusions about
several absorption components is resolved. The stars in Puppis-Vela flank the
region of the apparent extension of the Local Bubble (or Cavity) known as the
beta CMa tunnel,and measurements of the Na I column density towards the sample
stars have been used to modify existing estimates of the extent of the tunnel.
A compilation of all existing Na I observations of < 200 pc sight lines around
the tunnel reveal that low column densities have been exclusively detected

to explain observations of warm absorbing (WA) gas in UVX from Sy galaxies.
This paper focuses on two issues: (1) compatibility of kinematics and dynamics
of MHD wind with the observed properties of WAs; and (2) relationship between
the UVX absorptions. We provide an in-depth comparison between the MHD model
and the Sy 1 galaxy NGC 5548, which at high spectral resolution exhibits a
number of discrete UV absorption components. We find that: (1) the total column
densities of Ovii, Oviii and H, are reproduced by constraining the UV ion
column densities of Civ and Nv in each component to lie within a factor of 2 of
their observed values and optimizing over the possible sets of component
ionization states and Civ column densities; (2) the WA exists in the outer part
of the wind and is not a continuation of the flow in the BLR; and (3) the WA
extends in radial and polar directions and is ionization-stratified. X-ray
absorption is found to be heavily biased towards smaller r, and UV absorption
originates at larger distances from the central continuum source. We show that
the discrete absorption components along the line-of-sight are intrinsically
clumpy. Density differences between kinematic components result in a range of
ionization and recombination timescales. We further test the applicability of
the MHD wind to WAs in general, by constructing a quasi-continuous flow model,
and extending it to arbitrary aspect angles. We estimate the fraction of Sy 1s
having detectable WAs with larger Ovii column density than Oviii, and the range
of total H column densities. We also find that the ratio of Ovii to Oviii
optical depths can serve as a new diagnostic of AGN aspect angle.

optical depth. We consider the implications of this scenario using a toy model
of AGN spectra and support the results with full radiative transfer
computations from the codes TITAN and NOAR. We show that small random
rearrangements of the cloud distribution can happen on timescales of the order
of 10^2 - 10^6 s and may lead to relatively high variability amplitude in the
X-ray band if the mean covering factor is large. The normalized variability
amplitude in the UV band is either the same as in the X-ray band, if the
contribution from the dark sides of the clouds to the UV band is negligible, or
it is smaller. The X-ray spectrum should basically preserve its spectral shape
even during the high amplitude variability, within the frame of our model.

stochastic perturbations of the metric induced by quantum stress-energy
fluctuations of matter fields in a given state are considered on the background
of the ground state of semiclassical gravity, namely, Minkowski spacetime and a
scalar field in its vacuum state. The relevant equations are explicitly derived
for massless and massive fields arbitrarily coupled to the curvature. In doing
so, some semiclassical results, such as the expectation value of the
stress-energy tensor to linear order in the metric perturbations and particle
creation effects, are obtained. We then solve the equations and compute the
two-point correlation functions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the
metric perturbations. In the conformal field case, explicit results are
obtained. These results hint that gravitational fluctuations in stochastic
semiclassical gravity have a ``non-perturbative'' behavior in some
characteristic correlation lengths.

D-branes. We find that the level truncation method converges for these terms
within 2-4% when all massive fields up to level 20 are integrated out, although
the convergence is slower than exponential. We discuss the possibility of
extending this work to determine the structure of the nonabelian Born-Infeld
theory describing the gauge field on a system of many parallel bosonic or
supersymmetric D-branes. We also describe a brane configuration in which
tachyon condensation arises in both the gauge theory and string field theory
pictures. This provides a natural connection between recent work of Sen and
Zwiebach on tachyon condensation in string field theory and unstable vacua in
super Yang-Mills and Born-Infeld field theory.

noncocommutative Hopf algebra of rooted trees, decorated by an infinite set of
primitive divergences. The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, ${\cal
H}_R$, generated by a single primitive divergence, solves a universal problem
in Hochschild cohomology. It has two nontrivial closed Hopf subalgebras: the
cocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$ of pure ladder diagrams and
the Connes-Moscovici noncocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$ of
noncommutative geometry. These three Hopf algebras admit a bigrading by $n$,
the number of nodes, and an index $k$ that specifies the degree of primitivity.
In each case, we use iterations of the relevant coproduct to compute the
dimensions of subspaces with modest values of $n$ and $k$ and infer a simple
generating procedure for the remainder. The results for ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$
are familiar from the theory of partitions, while those for ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$
involve novel transforms of partitions. Most beautiful is the bigrading of
${\cal H}_R$, the largest of the three. Thanks to Sloane's {\tt superseeker},
we discovered that it saturates all possible inequalities. We prove this by
using the universal Hochschild-closed one-cocycle $B_+$, which plugs one set of
divergences into another, and by generalizing the concept of natural growth
beyond that entailed by the Connes-Moscovici case. We emphasize the yet greater
challenge of handling the infinite set of decorations of realistic quantum
field theory.

distant M5 branes, the probe must have the Hopf-WZ term with coefficient
proportional to N(N+1). Various related checks and observations are made. We
also point out that there are skyrmionic strings, and propose that they are the
