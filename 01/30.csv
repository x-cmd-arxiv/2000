ground-based cosmic ray detectors, have opened a new window in the field of
high-energy astrophysics. These events have macroscopic energies, unobserved
sources, an unknown chemical composition and a production and transport
mechanism yet to be explained. With a flux as low as one particle per century
per square kilometer, only dedicated detectors with huge apertures can bring in
the high-quality and statistically significant data needed to answer those
questions. In this article, we review the present status of the field both from
an experimental and theoretical point of view. Special attention is given to
the next generation of detectors devoted to the thorough exploration of the
highest energy ranges

the superpotential is that it have arithmetic genus 1. Divisors associated with
the short roots of non-simply laced gauge groups do not always satisfy this
condition while the divisors associated to all other roots do. For such a
`dissident' divisor we distinguish cases for which the arithmetic genus is
greater than unity corresponding to an X that is not general in moduli (in the
toric case this corresponds to the existence of non-toric parameters). In these
cases the `dissident' divisor D does not remain an effective divisor for
general complex structure. If however the arithmetic genus is less than or
equal to 0, then the divisor is general in moduli and there is a genuine
instability.

can be treated as its generalization, the Functional Self-similarity (FS).

concept in application to boundary value problem formulated in terms of
