well-defined sharp absorption features with the same radial velocities, while
the Halpha split into two distinct emission peaks in the last two spectra

equatorial ring with possible small-scale clumpiness in the nova shell.
  The visual lightcurve is used to deduce M_V by the maximum magnitude versus

  The spectra of the dwarf novae are dominated by emission lines of HI and HeI.
The large velocity and equivalent widths of these lines, in conjunction with
the fact that the lines are double-peaked in the highest inclination systems,
indicate an accretion disc origin. In the case of YZ Cnc and T Leo, for which
we obtained time-resolved data covering a complete orbital cycle, the emission
lines show modulations in their equivalent widths which are most probably
associated with the bright spot (the region where the gas stream collides with
the accretion disc). There are no clear detections of the secondary star in any
of the dwarf novae below the period gap, yielding upper limits of 10-30% for
the contribution of the secondary star to the observed K-band flux. In
conjunction with the K-band magnitudes of the dwarf novae, we use the derived
secondary star contributions to calculate lower limits to the distances to
these systems.
  The spectra of the novalike variables are dominated by broad, single-peaked
emission lines of HI and HeI - even the eclipsing systems we observed do not
show the double-peaked profiles predicted by standard accretion disc theory.
With the exception of RW Tri, which exhibits NaI, CaI and 12CO absorption

that on the whole very small not significant differences exist between the

confirming with a more quantitative approach, the qualitative conclusions by
Catelan (1998). This observational evidence translates into a very small
difference between the horizontal branch luminosity of field and cluster stars,

RR Lyrae at same metallicity, which is to be proven.

NGC4945 in the 0.1-200 keV energy band. The nuclear X-ray emission emerges
above ~7 keV, through an absorber with column density N_H ~ a few 10^24/cm/cm.
Its remarkable variability (doubling/halving timescale ~10^4 s) is not
associated with any appreciable spectral changes, ruling out variations of the
interposed absorber or changes in the primary continuum shape. The intense iron
K-ALPHA fluorescent emission line is likely to be produced by the same nuclear
absorbing matter. Our estimate of the intrinsic nuclear power suggests that the
active nucleus dominates the bolometric energy output of NGC4945, if its
nucleus has a typical quasar L_X/L(bol) ratio. This supports the idea that
X-rays are the best energy band to search for absorbed AGN. The 0.1-5 keV
emission is extended along the plane of the galaxy, and most likely due to a
population of unresolved binaries, as believed to happen in several early-type
galaxies. Alternatively, hot gas associated with a starburst-driven superwind
outflow could substantially contribute to the extended emission above 1 keV.

L_x/Lopt~10^{-3} the quiescent optical emission cannot be due to re-processing
of the X-rays, but has to be generated in the optical companion or the

lattice model in the strong-coupling limit, results in a Pokrovsky-Talapov
transition. This produces a conducting state with a charge susceptibility
diverging as the inverse of the doping, that seems in agreement with numerical
datas. Second, in the weak-coupling region, Kondo insulating transitions arise
due to the consequent renormalization of the backward Kondo scattering. Here,
the interplay between Kondo effect and electron-electron interactions gives
rise to significant phenomena in transport, in the high-temperature delocalized
(ballistic) regime. For repulsive interactions, as a perfect signature of Kondo
localization, the conductivity is found to decrease monotonically with
temperature. When interactions become attractive, spin fluctuations in the
electron (Luttinger-type) liquid are suddenly lowered. The latter is less
localized by magnetic impurities than for the repulsive counterpart, and as a
result a large jump in the Drude weight and a maximum in the conductivity arise
in the entrance of the Kondo insulating phase. These can be viewed as remnants
of s-wave superconductivity arising for attractive enough interactions.
Comparisons with transport in the single impurity model are also performed. We
finally discuss the case of randomly distributed magnetic defects, and the

three-dimensional XY systems. For this purpose we first consider the
small-field expansion of the effective potential (Helmholtz free energy) in the
high-temperature phase. We compute the first few nontrivial zero-momentum
n-point renormalized couplings, which parametrize such expansion, by analyzing
the high-temperature expansion of an improved lattice Hamiltonian with
suppressed leading scaling corrections.
  These results are then used to construct parametric representations of the
critical equation of state which are valid in the whole critical regime,
satisfy the correct analytic properties (Griffith's analyticity), and take into
account the Goldstone singularities at the coexistence curve. A systematic
approximation scheme is introduced, which is limited essentially by the number
of known terms in the small-field expansion of the effective potential.
  From our approximate representations of the equation of state, we derive
estimates of universal ratios of amplitudes. For the specific-heat amplitude
ratio we obtain A^+/A^-=1.055(3), to be compared with the best experimental
estimate A^+/A^-=1.054(1).

oscillating incoming flux of energy. The flux also induces black hole mass
oscillations around its average value. We assume that the metric fluctuations

phases and the amplitudes of Fourier modes of the fluctuations. By averaging
over these variables, we obtain an effective propagation for massless fields
which is characterized by a critical length defined by the amplitude of the
metric fluctuations: Smooth wave packets with respect to this length are not
significantly affected when they are propagated forward in time. Concomitantly,
we find that the asymptotic properties of Hawking radiation are not severely
modified. However, backward propagated wave packets are dissipated by the
metric fluctuations once their blue shifted frequency reaches the inverse
critical length. All these properties bear many resemblences with those
obtained in models for black hole radiation based on a modified dispersion
relation. This strongly suggests that the physical origin of these models,
which were introduced to confront the trans-Planckian problem, comes from the
fluctuations of the black hole geometry.

operating in the $M_{e^+e^-}\approx 1.5-2$ GeV range. A second topic, which
would be appropriate for a later date because it requires a rather higher beam
energy, is the production of C=(+) mesons in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions.

yet performed. Here its stability is investigated against the $z$-independent
perturbations composed of odd, even parities of graviton ($h_{\mu\nu}$) and BD

D-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to
non-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the case
of D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to a
smaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in the
presence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the opposite
orientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux
is more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely
consistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two
setups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the
mixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,
which we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and
construct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these results
we revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) and
point out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, in
the Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be the
consistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This is
related to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- as
well as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to be
inconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal field
theory orbifold. We also consider four dimensional N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric
orientifolds. We construct consistent four dimensional models with B-flux which
do not suffer from difficulties encountered in the K3 cases.

the transition from phase to defect chaos takes place when the periods of MAWs

resolved by using suitable nuclear reactions. Besides, we also study $K^-$ and
$\bar K^0$ nuclear bound states and compute binding energies and widths, for
both species of antikaons, in $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Despite of
restricting our study only to potentials obtained from best fits to the known
kaonic atom data, the dynamics of these nuclear bound states depend
dramatically on the particular optical potential used.

within the generator coordinate method using Skyrme-type effective forces and
three construction potentials, namely the harmonic-oscillator, the square-well
and Woods-Saxon potentials. Calculations of density distributions, radii,
nucleon momentum distributions, natural orbitals, occupation numbers and
depletions of the Fermi sea, as well as of pair density and momentum
distributions are carried out. A comparison of these quantities for both ground
and first excited monopole states with the available empirical data and with
the results of other theoretical methods are given and discussed in detail.

propagate in nuclear matter. We discuss possible manifestations of these modes
in experiments on heavy-ion collisions and on neutrino-nucleus scattering.
Calculations of reaction rates in medium can be harmed by double counting,
which arises because the very same quantum numbers can be carried in medium as
by single particle excitations as by multi-particle ones. We argue that the
optical theorem written in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions
provides a convenient formalism (closed diagram technique) void of double
counting.

  quantum computer using nuclear spins","4pages, LaTeX2e file",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We found that the actual computational time-cost of the QFT is O(n 2^n) for
large n in a quantum computer using nuclear spins. The computational cost of a
quantum algorithm has usually been estimated as the sum of the universal gates
required in such ideal mathematical models as the Quantum Turing Machine(QTM)
and the quantum circuit. This cost is proportional to an actual time-cost in
the physical implementation where all quantum operations can be achieved in the
same time. However, if the implementation takes a different time for each
quantum gate, there is a possibility that the actual time-cost will have a
different behavior from the ideal cost. So we estimated the actual time-cost of
the QFT in these implementations by considering the gating time. The actual
time-cost is drastically different from O(n^2) estimated by complexity
analysis.
