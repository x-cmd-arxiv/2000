starburst galaxy M82. Spectra, covering 3250-8790 A at a resolution of 1.6 A,
were obtained at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) for cluster F and
the highly reddened cluster L. We compare the strengths of the observed Balmer
absorption lines and the Balmer jump in the blue spectrum of F with theoretical
model cluster spectra using the PEGASE spectral synthesis code to derive an age
of 60+/-20 Myr. For cluster L, we find that the similarities in the strength of
the Ca II triplet and overall spectral appearance with cluster F suggest a
similar age. The brightness and compactness of cluster F make it an ideal
candidate for determining its dynamical mass by measuring the velocity
dispersion. We present the results of such an investigation based on echelle
spectra at a resolution of 8 km/s obtained at the WHT from 5760-9140 A. By
cross-correlating various wavelength regions in the spectrum of cluster F with
cool giant and supergiant template stars, we derive a velocity dispersion and,
by application of the virial theorem, determine a dynamical mass of 2 million
solar masses. We compare our derived mass with those determined for other young
super star clusters and discuss whether our derived parameters are consistent
with cluster F being able to survive to become a globular cluster.

widths of contributing clouds or flow elements are much wider than their
thermal widths, due to the presence of non-dissipative MHD waves, and their
collective contribution produce emission line profiles broader and smoother
than would be expected if a magnetic field were not present. As an
illustration, a simple model of isotropically emitting clouds, normally

less than 80,000 clouds and may even be as low as a few hundred. We conclude
that magnetic confinement has far reaching consequences for observing and

distributions for the years 1996 - 1999 show that an increasing part of the

likely caused by free-free radiation in the stellar wind. Starting from 1997 or

dramatic decrease of optical radiation and the growing infrared excess. Its
photometric behavior in 1998 - 1999 mimics the ``red declines'' of R CrB
variables, the amplitude, however, is more extreme than any fading ever

For the description of neutron star matter, we employ a field-theoretical
approach which permits the study of several models which differ in their
behavior at high density. Effects of Landau quantization in ultra-strong
magnetic fields ($B>10^{14}$ Gauss) lead to a reduction in the electron
chemical potential and a substantial increase in the proton fraction. We find
the generic result for $B>10^{18}$ Gauss that the softening of the EOS caused
by Landau quantization is overwhelmed by stiffening due to the incorporation of
the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons. In addition, the neutrons
become completely spin polarized. The inclusion of ultra-strong magnetic fields
leads to a dramatic increase in the proton fraction, with consequences for the
direct Urca process and neutron star cooling. The magnetization of the matter
never appears to become very large, as the value of $|H/B|$ never deviates from
unity by more than a few percent. Our findings have implications for the

high-velocity spectral features, using a total of 25 epochs of observations
from Effelsberg (5 epochs), the VLA (15 epochs), and the VLBA (5 epochs)
spanning the years 1994 to 1997. The measured accelerations of the
systemic-velocity features are between 7.5 and 10.4 km/s/yr, and there is no
evidence for a dip in the spectrum at the systemic velocity. Such a dip has
been attributed in the past to an absorbing layer of non-inverted H2O (Watson &
Wallin 1994; Maoz & McKee 1998). The accelerations of the high-velocity
features, measured here for the first time, range from -0.77 to 0.38 km/s/yr.
  From the line-of-sight accelerations and velocities, we infer the positions
of these high-velocity masers with a simple edge-on disk model. The resulting
positions fall between -13.6 and 9.3 degrees in azimuth (measured from the
midline, the diameter perpendicular to the line of sight). A model that
suggests a spiral shock origin of the masers (Maoz & McKee 1998), in which
changes in maser velocity are due to the outward motion of the shock wave,
predicts apparent accelerations of -0.05 times theta_p/2.5 degrees km/s/yr,
where theta_p is the pitch angle of the spiral arms. Our data are not
consistent with these predictions. We also discuss the physical properties of
the high-velocity masers. Most notably, the strongest high-velocity masers lie
near the midline, where the velocity gradient is smallest, thereby providing
the longest amplification path lengths. (Abridged)

bursts from six low-mass X-ray binaries has provided a powerful new tool to
study the properties of matter at supranuclear densities, the effects of strong
gravity, and the propagation of thermonuclear burning. There is substantial
evidence that these brightness oscillations are produced by spin modulation of
one or two localized hot spots confined to the stellar surface. It is therefore
important to calculate the expected light curves produced by such hot spots
under various physical assumptions, so that comparison with the observed light
curves may most sensitively yield information about the underlying physical
quantities. In this paper we make general relativistic calculations of the
light curves and oscillation amplitudes produced by a rotating neutron star
with one or two hot spots as a function of spot size, stellar compactness,
rotational velocity at the stellar surface, spot location, orientation of the
line of sight of the observer, and the angular dependence of the surface
specific intensity. We find that stellar rotation and beaming of the emission
tend to increase the observed oscillation amplitudes whereas greater
compactness and larger spot size tend to decrease them. By applying these
results to 4U 1636--536, we show that this source must have two emitting spots
and place strong constraints on the neutron star's magnetic field geometry. We
also show that the data on the phase lags between photons of different energies
in the persistent pulsations in SAX J1808--58 can be fit well with a model in
which the observed hard leads are due to Doppler beaming.

These objects have spectra typical of old stellar systems, but are unresolved

they are 10 times more luminous than any Galactic globular clusters, but
fainter than any known compact dwarf galaxies. These objects are all within 30
arcminutes of the central galaxy of the cluster, NGC 1399, but are distributed
over larger radii than the globular cluster system of that galaxy. We suggest
that these objects are either super-massive star clusters (intra-cluster
globular clusters or tidally stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies) or a new type
of low-luminosity compact elliptical dwarf (M32-type) galaxy. The best way to
test these hypotheses will be to obtain high resolution imaging and
high-dispersion spectroscopy to determine their structures and mass-to-light
ratios. This will allow us to compare them to known compact objects and
establish if they represent a new class of hitherto unknown stellar system.

the nature of the dark matter. It is universally accepted that there is an
abundance of matter in the universe which is non-luminous, due to their very
weak interaction, if at all, with the other forms of matter, excepting of
course the gravitational attraction. Speculations as to the nature of dark
matter are numerous, often bordering on exotics, and searches for such exotic
matter is a very active field of astroparticle physics at the dawn of the new
century. Nevertheless, in recent years, there has been experimental evidence
for at least one form of dark matter - the massive compact halo objects
detected through gravitational microlensing effects proposed by Paczynski some
years ago. To date, no clear consensus as to what these objects, referred to in
the literature as well as in the following by the acronym MACHO, are made of;
for a brief discussion of some of the suggestions, see below. In this work, we
show that they find a natural explanation as leftover relics from the putative

are fine structure and recombination lines originating in the narrow line
region. We compare the line profiles of optical lines and reddening-insensitive
infrared lines to constrain the dynamical structure and extinction properties
of the NLR. The considerable differences found are most likely explained by two
effects. (1) The spatial structure of the NLR is a combination of a highly
ionized outflow cone and lower excitation extended emission. (2) Parts of the
NLR, mainly in the receding part at velocities above systemic, are subject to
extinction that is significantly suppressing optical emission. Line asymmetries
and net blueshifts remain, however, even for infrared fine structure lines
suffering very little obscuration. This may be either due to an intrinsic
asymmetry of the NLR, or due to a very high column density obscuring component
which is hiding part of the NLR even from infrared view. Mid-infrared emission
of molecular hydrogen in NGC 1068 arises in a dense molecular medium at
temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin that is most likely closely related to the
warm and dense components seen in the near-infrared H2 transitions, and in
millimeter wave tracers of molecular gas. Any emission of the putative pc-scale

predominantly parallel to the source main axis. We observe Faraday rotation at
low frequencies, most probably produced by an ionized medium external to the
radio source. The spectral index distribution is that typical of FR II radio
galaxies, with spectral indices gradually steepening from the source extremes
towards the core. Modeling the spectrum in the lobes using standard synchrotron
loss models yields the spectral age of the source and the mean velocity of the
jet-head with respect to the lobe material. The existence of a possible
backflow in the lobe is considered to relate spectral with dynamical
determinations of the age and the velocity with respect to the external medium.
Through a very simple model, we obtain a physical characterization of the jets
and the external medium in which the radio galaxy expands. The results in
8C0821+695 are consistent with a relativistic jet nourishing the lobes which
expand in a hot, low density halo. We infer a deceleration of the source

comparing the lensed luminosities of background galaxies with the luminosity

sampling of luminosity space, this method is not limited by clustering noise.
We use photometric redshift information to estimate galaxy distance and
intrinsic luminosity. Knowing the redshift distribution of the background
population allows us to lift the mass/background degeneracy common to lensing
analysis. In this paper we use 9 filters observed over 12 hours with the Calar
Alto 3.5m telescope to determine the redshifts of 1000 galaxies in the field of

budget includes uncertainties from the photometric redshift determination, the
uncertainty in the off-set calibration and finite sampling. This result is in
good agreement with that found by number count and shear-based methods and

properties of radio galaxies, we studied a complete sample of 26 nearby FR II
radio galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and compared them with
a sample of FR I previously analyzed. FR I nuclei lie in the radio-optical
luminosity plane along a tight linear correlation, which argues for a common
synchrotron origin. FR II show a more complex behavior, which is however
clearly related to their optical spectral classification.
  Broad line FR II radio galaxies (BLRG) are located overall well above the FR
I correlation, suggesting that a contribution from thermal (disc) emission is
present. Three narrow line (NLRG) and one weak line radio galaxy (WLRG), in
which no nuclear source is seen, can be interpreted as the obscured
counter-parts of BLRG, in agreement with the current unification schemes.
  Conversely, in 5 sources of the sample, all of them NLRG or WLRG, optical
cores are located on the same correlation defined by FR I and with similar
radio and optical luminosities. This suggests that, in analogy to FR I, the
emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation and represents the optical
counter-part of the non-thermal radio cores. Interestingly, all these galaxies
are located in clusters, an environment typical of FR I.
  These results imply that, at least at low redshifts, the FR II population is
not homogeneous. Furthermore, the traditional dichotomy between edge darkened
and brightened radio morphology is not univocally connected with the innermost
nuclear structure, as we find FR~II with FR I-like nuclei and this has
interesting bearings from the point of view of the AGN unified models.

during 24 observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. We
report the discovery of a new broad component in the power spectra. The
frequency of this component varied between 9 and 14 Hz, and remained close to
half that of the horizontal branch quasi-periodic oscillations (HBO). Its rms
amplitude was consistent with being constant around ~5%, while its FWHM
increased with frequency from 7 to 18 Hz. If this sub-HBO component is the
fundamental frequency, then the HBO and its second harmonic are the second and
fourth harmonic component, while the third harmonic was not detected. This is
similar to what was recently found for the black hole candidate XTE J1550-564.
The profiles of both the horizontal- and the normal branch quasi-periodic
oscillation peaks were asymmetric when they were strongest. We describe this in
terms of a shoulder component at the high frequency side of the quasi-periodic
oscillation peak, whose rms amplitudes were approximately constant at ~4% and
\~3%, respectively. The peak separation between the twin kHz quasi-periodic
oscillations was consistent with being constant at 339+-8 Hz but a trend
similar to that seen in, e.g. Sco X-1 could not be excluded. We discuss our
results within the framework of the various models which have been proposed for
the kHz QPOs and low frequency peaks.

IC4329a. The iron line is significantly broadened, but not to the extent
expected from an accretion disk which extends down to the last stable orbit
around a black hole. We marginally detect a narrow line component, presumably
from the molecular torus, but even including this gives a line profile from the
accretion disk which is significantly narrower that that seen in MCG-6-30-15,
and is much more like that seen from the low/hard state galactic black hole
candidates. This is consistent with the inner disk being truncated before the
last stable orbit, forming a hot flow at small radii as in the ADAF models.
However, we cannot rule out the presence of an inner disk which does not
contribute to the reflected spectrum, either because of extreme ionisation
suppressing the characteristic atomic features of the reflected spectrum or
because the X-ray source is intrinsically anisotropic, so it does not
illuminate the inner disk.
  The source was monitored by RXTE every 2 days for 2 months, and these
snapshot spectra show that there is intrinsic spectral variability. The data
are good enough to disentangle the power law from the reflected continuum and
we see that the power law softens as the source brightens. The lack of a
corresponding increase in the observed reflected spectrum implies that either
the changes in disk inner radial extent/ionisation structure are small, or that
the variability is actually driven by changes in the seed photons which are
decoupled from the hard X-ray mechanism.

196.7 um. The data was obtained with the ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer
(LWS). We conclude that the FIR emission in a 70 arcsec beam centred on the
nucleus is dominated by star formation rather than AGN activity. The flux in
the far-infrared lines is ~ 1 % of the total FIR: the [CII] line flux is ~ 0.4
% FIR and the [OI] line is ~ 0.2 %, with the remainder arising from [OIII],
[NII] and [NIII] lines. These are typical values for starburst galaxies.
  The ratio of the [NIII]/[NII] line intensities from the HII regions in the
dust lane can be modelled as a ~ 6 million year old starburst. This suggests
that the galaxy underwent either a recent merger or a merger which triggered a
series of bursts.
  We estimate that < 5 % of the observed [CII] arises in the cold neutral
medium (CNM) and that ~ 10 % arises in the warm ionized medium (WIM). The main
contributors to the [CII] emission are the PDRs, which are located throughout
the dust lane and in regions beyond where the bulk of the molecular material
lies. On scales of ~ 1 kpc the average physical properties of the PDRs are
modelled with a gas density, n ~ 1000 cm^-3, an incident far-UV field, G ~ 100
times the local Galactic field, and a gas temperature of ~ 250 K.

proposed that strong mass-losses trigger rotational instabilities in the
envelope of fast rotating stars. The kinetic energy transferred to turbulent
motions would then be the energy source of the active phenomena observed in the
outer atmosphere of Herbig Ae/Be stars (Vigneron et al. 1990; Lignieres et al.
1996).
  In this paper, we present a one-dimensional model of angular momentum
transport which allows to estimate the degree of differential rotation induced
by mass-loss. Gradients of angular velocity are very close to - 2 \Omega / R
(\Omega being the surface rotation rate and R the stellar radius). For strong
mass-loss, this process occurs in a short time scale as compared to other
processes of angular momentum transport. Application of existing stability
criteria indicates that rotational instabilities should develop for fast
rotating star. Thus, in fast rotating stars with strong winds, shear
instabilities are expected to develop and to generate subphotospheric turbulent
motions. Albeit very simple, this model gives strong support to the assumption
made by Vigneron et al. 1990 and Lignieres et al. 1996.

extreme degeneracy of the ground state: only one harmonic mode is present,
together with N-1 zero modes. We obtain empirically an analytical formula for
the probability density function for the angle made by the rotator, which
compares extremely well with numerical data and should become exact in the zero

with the well-known case of a one-dimensional (1D) parallel array of Josephson

expanding background due to a time varying scalar field oscillating at the
bottom of the inflationary potential. The two components of the gravitino,
namely helicity 1/2 and helicity 3/2, are excited differently due to the
presence of different time varying mass scales in the problem. In this paper we
analyse the production of both the helicities in a multi-chiral scenario, in
particular focusing on a general model of hybrid inflation. Fermion production
in hybrid models is very much different from that of the chaotic models
discussed so far in the literature. In this paper we give a full account of
gravitino production analytically and numerically. It is noticed that the
creation of gravitinos does not take place in the first few oscillations of the
inflaton field, rather the production is a gradual and delayed process. It
takes roughly 30-40 oscillations to build up the production and for the
saturation to take place it can even take longer time, depending on the model
parameters. We give an estimation of the reheat temperature and a brief
discussion upon back-reaction on the fermionic production, which could change
the gravitino abundance.

coefficients for the dimension 6 scalar gluon operators by Nikolaev and
Radyushkin, our result completes the list of all the Wilson coefficients of

that the density dependent contribution from dimension 6 operators is less than

about -4 MeV mass shift for the charmonium at rest in nuclear matter.

number of subtaxa per taxon tend to approximate power laws, but often show
strong deviationns from such a law. Previously, these deviations were
attributed to finite-time effects in a continuous time branching process at the
generic level. Instead, we describe here a simple discrete branching process
which generates the observed distributions and find that the distribution's
deviation from power-law form is not caused by disequilibration, but rather
that it is time-independent and determined by the evolutionary properties of
the taxa of interest. Our model predicts-with no free parameters-the
rank-frequency distribution of number of families in fossil marine animal
orders obtained from the fossil record. We find that near power-law
distributions are statistically almost inevitable for taxa higher than species.
The branching model also sheds light on species abundance patterns, as well as
on links between evolutionary processes, self-organized criticality and
fractals.

description of quantum mechanics. Our computational methodology is based upon a
finite-element moving least-squares method (MWLS) presented recently by Wyatt
and co-workers (Lopreore and Wyatt, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 5190 (1999)).
This method treats the ""particles"" in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation as
Lagrangian fluid elements which carry the phase, $S$, and density,
  $\rho$, required to reconstruct the quantum wavefunctions. Here, we compare
results obtained via the MWLS procedure to exact results obtained either
analytically or by numerical solution of the time dependent Schr\""odinger
equation. Two systems are considered: firstly, dynamics in a harmonic well and
secondly tunneling dynamics in a double well potential. In the case of
tunneling in the double well potential, the quantum potential acts to lower the
barrier separating the right and left hand sides of the well permitting
trajectories to pass from one side to another.
  However, as probability density passes from one side to the other, the
effective barrier begins to rise and eventually will segregate trajectories in
one side from the other. We note that the MWLS trajectories exhibited long time
stability in the purely harmonic cases. However, this stability was not evident
in the barrier crossing dynamics. Comparisons to exact trajectories obtained
via wave packet calculations indicate that the MWLS trajectories tend to
underestimate the effects of constructive and destructive interference effects.

more effective way of increasing entanglement. An explicit decomposition into

distribution is indistinguishable from the Planck law for T<T_{critical} but
for T>T_{critical} the maximum of the distribution gets lowered and shifts
towards higher frequencies. T_{critical} is a parameter that, in principle,
