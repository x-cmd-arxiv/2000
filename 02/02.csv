Overmerging is the disruption of subhaloes within embedding haloes due to {\it

shown that the process responsible for overmerging is particle-subhalo two-body
heating. Various solutions to the overmerging problem are discussed

the form of these correlators. We finally show how these correlators may be
decomposed into eigenmodes, thereby reducing a defect problem to a series of

these theories and how they fare against observations. We finally describe yet
another application of topological defects in cosmology: baryogenesis.

literature measurements of this fading rate at lower (38 - 300 MHz) and higher

factor of approximately 3 over the past 50 years at the lower frequencies,

with a measurement of the fading rate at the nearby frequency of 927 MHz by
Vinyajkin (1997), show an intermediate behavior at intermediate frequencies. We
also find that Cassiopeia A, as of approximately 1990, was fading at about the

measurements are required to determine whether the fading rate will continue to
decrease at the lower frequencies, or whether Cassiopeia A will now fade at a
relatively constant rate at all of these frequencies.

flat radio spectra. Our spectroscopy indicates that the optical counterpart of
the radio core is at a redshift of z=0.145, so the linear size of the radio

host galaxy reveals an excess number of candidate galaxy cluster members above
the number typically found in the field surrounding a giant radio galaxy. WIYN
HYDRA spectra of a sample of the candidate cluster members reveal that six
share the same redshift as NVSS 2146+82, indicating the presence of at least a

limiting any X-ray emission at the distance of the radio galaxy to that typical
of a poor group or weak AGN. Several other giant radio galaxies have been found
in regions with overdensities of nearby galaxies, and a separate study has
shown that groups containing FR IIs are underluminous in X-rays compared to
groups without radio sources. We speculate that the presence of the host galaxy
in an optically rich group of galaxies that is underluminous in X-rays may be
related to the giant radio galaxy phenomenon.

density, and velocity distribution of galaxies in the near neighborhood of a
host galaxy. The fractional luminosity in kinematic pairs combines all of these
effects in a single estimator which is relatively insensitive to population
evolution. Here we use a k-corrected and evolution compensated volume-limited
sample drawing about 300 redshifts from CFGRS and 3000 from CNOC2 to measure
the rate and redshift evolution of merging. We identify kinematic pairs with
projected separations less than either 50 or 100 \hkpc and rest-frame velocity
differences of less than 1000\kms. The fractional luminosity in pairs is
modeled as f_L(Delta v,r_p,M_r^{ke})(1+z)^{m_L} where [f_L,m_L] are
[0.14+/-0.07,0+/-1.4] and [0.37+/-0.7,0.1+/-0.5] for r_p<= 50 and 100\hkpc,
respectively (Omega_M=0.2, Omega_Lambda=0.8). The value of m_L is about 0.6
larger if Lambda=0. To convert these redshift space statistics to a merger rate
we use the data to derive a conversion factor to physical space pair density, a
merger probability and a mean in-spiral time. The resulting mass accretion rate
per galaxy (M_1,M_2>= 0.2 M*) is 0.02+/-0.01(1+z)^{0.1+/-0.5} M*~Gyr^{-1}.
Present day high-luminosity galaxies therefore have accreted approximately
0.15M* of their mass over the approximately 7 Gyr to redshift one. (abridged)

core of galaxy clusters, which was indicated by our work on the X-ray
fundamental plane. The adopted model supposes that the gas distribution
characterized by the slope parameter is related to the preheated temperature.
Comparison with observations of relatively hot (~> 3 keV) and low redshift
clusters suggests that the preheated temperature is about 0.5-2 keV, which is
higher than expected from the conventional galactic wind model and possibly
suggests the need for additional heating such as quasars or gravitational
heating on the largest scales at high redshift. The dispersion of the preheated
temperature may be attributed to the gravitational heating in subclusters. We
calculate the central gas fraction of a cluster from the gas distribution,
assuming that the global gas mass fraction is constant within a virial radius
at the time of the cluster collapse. We find that the central gas density thus
calculated is in good agreement with the observed one, which suggests that the
variation of gas mass fraction in cluster cores appears to be explained by
breaking the self-similarity in clusters due to preheated gas. We also find
that this model does not change major conclusions on the fundamental plane and
its cosmological implications obtained in previous papers, which strongly
suggests that not only for the dark halo but also for the intracluster gas the
core structure preserves information about the cluster formation.

regions. These nebulae form the basis for measuring the primordial helium
abundance. Our models show that the helium ionization correction factor (ICF)
can be non-negligible for nebulae excited by stars with effective temperatures
larger than 40,000 K. Furthermore, we find that when the effective temperature
rises to above 45,000 K, the ICF can be significantly negative. This result is
independent of the choice of stellar atmosphere. However, if an HII region has
an [O III] 5007/[O I] 6300 ratio greater than 300, then our models show that,
regardless of its metallicity, it will have a negligibly small ICF. A similar,
but metallicity dependent, result was found using the [O III] 5007/H$\beta$
ratio. These two results can be used as selection criteria to remove nebulae
with potentially non-negligible ICFs. Using our metallicity independent
criterion on the data of Izotov & Thuan (1998) results in a 20% reduction of
the rms scatter about the best fit $Y-Z$ line. A fit to the selected data
results in a slight increase of the value of the primordial helium abundance.

are self-interacting, as a solution to two discrepancies between the
predictions of cold dark matter models and the observations: first, the
observed dark matter distribution in some dwarf galaxies has large,
constant-density cores, as opposed to the predicted central cusps; and second,
small satellites of normal galaxies are much less abundant than predicted. The
dark matter self-interaction would produce isothermal cores in halos, and would
also expel the dark matter particles from dwarfs orbiting within large halos.
However, another inevitable consequence of the model is that halos should
become spherical once most particles have interacted. Here, I rule out this
model by the fact that the innermost regions of dark matter halos in massive
clusters of galaxies are elliptical, as shown by gravitational lensing and
other observations. The absence of collisions in the lensing cores of massive
clusters implies that any dark matter self-interaction is too weak to have
affected the observed density profiles in the dark-matter dominated dwarf
galaxies, or to have eased the destruction of dwarf satellites in galactic
halos. If $s_x$ is the cross section and $m_x$ the mass of the dark matter

dendritic solidification in the low undercooling limit where the dendrite tip
radius is one or more orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic
spatial scale of variation of the surrounding thermal or solutal diffusion
field. The first key feature of this method is an efficient multiscale
diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) algorithm which allows off-lattice random walkers
to take longer and concomitantly rarer steps with increasing distance away from
the solid-liquid interface. As a result, the computational cost of evolving the
large scale diffusion field becomes insignificant when compared to that of
calculating the interface evolution. The second key feature is that random
walks are only permitted outside of a thin liquid layer surrounding the
interface. Inside this layer and in the solid, the diffusion equation is solved
using a standard finite-difference algorithm that is interfaced with the DMC
algorithm using the local conservation law for the diffusing quantity. Here we
combine this algorithm with a previously developed phase-field formulation of
the interface dynamics and demonstrate that it can accurately simulate
three-dimensional dendritic growth in a previously unreachable range of low
undercoolings that is of direct experimental relevance.

opposite, it de-couples from the superconducting matrix becoming more ordered.

erased random walk (LERW) critical exponent, suggested by numerical results,
this approach allows to estimate the lower critical dimension of the model and
the exact value of the critical exponent for LERW in three dimension. The
avalanche size distribution in two dimensions is found to be the difference
between two closed power laws.

diagrams vanish because energy is not conserved but the finite decaying widths
make the mixing possible. We can consider the neutrinos to be ""fuzzy"" states on
their mass shell and the mixing is understood as the overlap of two
wavefunctions. These considerations restrict the mass difference to be
approximately equal to or smaller than the largest of the two widths: abs(M_i -
M_j) lessorequal max(Gamma_i, Gamma_j).

standard Higgs model is, however, trivial and can only be an effective field
theory valid below some high energy scale characteristic of the underlying
non-trivial physics. Corrections to the custodial isospin violating parameter T
arising from interactions at this higher energy scale dramatically enlarge the
allowed range of Higgs mass. We perform a fit to precision electroweak data and
determine the region in the (m_H, Delta T) plane that is consistent with
experimental results. Overlaying the estimated size of corrections to T arising
from the underlying dynamics, we find that a Higgs mass up to 500 GeV is
allowed. We review two composite Higgs models which can realize the possibility
of a phenomenologically acceptable heavy Higgs boson. We comment on the
potential of improvements in the measurements of m_t and M_W to improve
constraints on composite Higgs models.

partial wave series is accelerated and possible spurious contributions in the
Faddeev components are avoided. We demonstrate how the method works with the
example of the Goldstone-boson-exchange chiral quark model for baryons.

proton-neutron mixed-symmetry quadrupole phonon in near-spherical nuclei is
investigated. The one-phonon states decay by collective E3 and E2 transitions
to the ground state and by relatively strong E1 and M1 transitions to the
isoscalar 2+ state. We apply the proton-neutron version of the Interacting
Boson Model including quadrupole and octupole bosons (sdf-IBM-2). Two F-spin
symmetric dynamical symmetry limits of the model, namely the vibrational and
the \gamma-unstable ones, are considered. We derive analytical formulae for
excitation energies as well as B(E1), B(M1), B(E2) and B(E3) values for a
number of transitions between low-lying states.

qualitatively the recently obtained experimental results concerning the
quasimolecular stage of a light-particle accompanied fission process. It was
derived from the liquid drop model under the assumption that the aligned
configuration, with the emitted particle between the light and heavy fragment,
is reached by increasing continuously the separation distance, while the radii
of the heavy fragment and of the light particle are kept constant. In such a
way,a new minimum of a short-lived molecular state appears in the deformation
energy at a separation distance very close to the touching point. This minimum
allows the existence of a short-lived quasi-molecular state, decaying into the
three final fragments.The influence of the shell effects is discussed. The
half-lives of some quasimolecular states which could be formed in the $^{10}$Be
and $^{12}$C accompanied fission of $^{252}$Cf are roughly estimated to be the
order of 1 ns, and 1 ms, respectively.

model allows one-qubit operations and the two-qubit controlled-NOT gate as
required for universal quantum computation. The n quantum bits are described by
two energy levels of each atom/dot. An external laser and n separate pairs of
electrodes are used to address a single atom/dot independent of the others, via
Stark effect. The third level of each system and an additional common-mode
qubit (a cavity photon) are used for realizing the controlled-NOT operation
between any pair of qubits. Laser frequency, cavity frequency, and energy
levels are far off-resonance, and they are brought to resonance by modifying
the energy-levels of a 3-level system using the Stark effect, only at the time
of operation.

equations. In the limit of short times, the photon statistics for small laser
devices such as typical semiconductor laser diodes show thermal characteristics
even above threshold. In the limit of long time averages represented by the low
frequency component of the noise, the same devices exhibit squeezing. It is
shown that squeezing and thermal noise can coexist in the multi-mode output
field of laser diodes. This result implies that the squeezed light generated by
regularly pumped semiconductor laser diodes is qualitatively different from
single mode squeezed light. In particular, no entanglement between photons can
be generated using this type of collective multi-mode squeezing.
