calculate that noise, as a function of the parameters of digitization. The
noise of the correlation function is related to the underlying spectrum, by
constants that depend on the digitization parameters. Noise affects variances
of elements of the correlation function and covariances between them. In the

change their topology. This process is essential for understanding a wide
variety of astrophysical processes, including stellar and galactic dynamos and
astrophysical turbulence. To account for solar flares, solar cycles and the
structure of the galactic magnetic field reconnection must be fast, propagating
with a speed close to the Alfven speed. We show that the presence of a random
magnetic field component substantially enhances the reconnection rate and
enables fast reconnection, i.e. reconnection that does not depend on fluid
resistivity. The enhancement of the reconnection rate is achieved via a
combination of two effects. First of all, only small segments of magnetic field
lines are subject to direct Ohmic annihilation. Thus the fraction of magnetic
energy that goes directly into fluid heating goes to zero as fluid resistivity
vanishes. However, the most important enhancement comes from the fact that
unlike the laminar fluid case where reconnection is constrained to proceed line
by line, the presence of turbulence enables many magnetic field lines to enter
the reconnection zone simultaneously. A significant fraction of magnetic energy
goes into MHD turbulence and this enhances reconnection rates through an
increase in the field stochasticity. In this way magnetic reconnection becomes
fast when field stochasticity is accounted for. As a consequence solar and
galactic dynamos are also fast, i.e. do not depend on fluid resistivity.

radiation of optically thin accretion flow is investigated. Bremsstrahlung and
synchrotron radiations amplified by Comptonization are taken into account and
two-temperature plasma assumption is adopted. The three OBCs we adopted are the
temperatures of the electrons and ions and the specific angular momentum of the
accretion flow at a certain outer boundary. We find that when the general
parameters such as the mass accretion rate and the viscous parameter are fixed,
the peak flux at various bands such as radio, IR and X-ray, can differ by as
large as several orders of magnitude under different OBCs in our example. Our
results indicate that OBC is both dynamically and radiatively important

discrepancy between the mass accretion rate favored by ADAF models in the

substellar with a mass in the range 0.02-0.03 solar masses. The accurate

the position of the star that illuminates (and presumably generated) the
bipolar, pre-planetary reflection nebula RAFGL 2688 (the Egg Nebula). The
polarimetric data pinpoint the illuminating star, which is not detected
directly at wavelengths less than or equal to 2 microns, at a position well
within the dark lane that bisects the nebula, 0.55"" (about 550 AU) southwest of
the infrared peak which was previously detected at the southern tip of the
northern polar lobe. The inferred position of the central star corresponds to
the geometric center of the tips of the four principle lobes of near-infrared
H2 emission; identifying the central star at this position also reveals the
strong point symmetric structure of the nebula, as seen both in the intensity
and polarization structure of the polar lobes. The polarimetric and imaging
data indicate that the infrared peak directly detected in the NICMOS images is
a self-luminous source and, therefore, is most likely a distant binary
companion to the illuminating star. Although present theory predicts that
bipolar structure in pre-planetary and planetary nebulae is a consequence of
binary star evolution, the separation between the components of the RAFGL 2688
binary system, as deduced from these observations, is much too large for the
presence of the infrared companion to have influenced the structure of the

ring threaded by a static magnetic flux phi that is generated by a
time-dependent electric field oscillating with frequency omega. We show that in
quadratic order in the field there are three fundamentally different
contributions to the current. (a) A time-independent contribution which can be
obtained from a thermodynamic derivative. (b) A term increasing linearly in
time that can be understood in terms of Fermi's golden rule. The derivation of
this term requires a careful treatment of the infinitesimal imaginary parts
that are added to the real frequency omega when the electric field is
adiabatically switched on. (c) Finally, there is also a time-dependent current
oscillating with frequency 2 omega. We suggest an experiment to test our
results.

numerical simulation in the simplest cases of two and three coupled junctions.
At a given driving current, several different bunched states are stable and
move at velocities that are higher than corresponding single-fluxon velocity.
These and some of the more complex higher-order bunched states and transitions
between them are investigated in detail.

the cosine of the CP-violating phase of the higgsino mass parameter $\mu$, and

Assuming the usual GUT inspired relation between M_1 and M_2 we show that there
are only small regions with moderate tanbeta and large stop mixings that may be
dangerous. Pathological models not excluded by LEP which have degeneracy
between the sneutrino and the chargino are however a real danger because of
large branching fraction of the Higgs into invisibles. We have also studied
models where the gaugino masses are not unified at the GUT scale. We take
M_1=M_2/10 as an example where large reductions in the signal at the LHC can
occur. However we argue that such models with a very light neutralino LSP may
give a too large relic density unless the sleptons are light. We then combine
this cosmological constraint with neutralino production with light sfermions to
further reduce the parameter space that precludes observability of the Higgs at
the LHC. We still find regions of parameter space where the drops in the usual
Higgs signals at the LHC can be drastic. Nonetheless, in such scenarios where
Higgs may escape detection we show that one should be able to produce all
charginos and neutralinos. Although the heavier of these could cascade into the
Higgs, the rates are not too high and the Higgs may not always be recovered
this way.
