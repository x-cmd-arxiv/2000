population of luminous, sub-mm sources. These are proposed to lie at high
redshift and to be optically faint due to their high intrinsic dust
obscuration. The presence of dust has been previously invoked in optical galaxy
count models which assume $\tau=9$ Gyr Bruzual & Charlot evolution for spirals
and these fit the count data well from U to K. We now show that by using either
a 1/$\lambda$ or Calzetti absorption law for the dust and re-distributing the
evolved spiral galaxy UV radiation into the far infra-red(FIR), these models
can account for all of the `faint'($\leq1$mJy) $850\mu$m galaxy counts, but
fail to fit 'bright'($\ge2$mJy) sources, indicating that another explanation
for the sub-mm counts may apply at brighter fluxes(e.g. QSOs, ULIRGs). We find
that the main contribution to the faint, sub-mm number counts is in the
redshift range $0.5 < z < 3$, peaking at $z\approx 1.8$. The above model, using
either dust law, can also explain a significant proportion of the
extra-galactic background at $850\mu$m as well as producing a reasonable fit to
the bright $60\mu m$ IRAS counts.

theoretical considerations, suggest that the breaking of self-similarity in the
hot gas results from an `entropy floor', established by some heating process,
which affects the structure of the intracluster gas strongly in lower mass
systems. Fitting analytical models for the radial variation in gas density and
temperature to X-ray spectral images from the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS, we
derive gas entropy profiles for 20 galaxy clusters and groups. Scaling these
profiles to coincide in the self-similar case, the lowest mass systems are
found to have higher scaled entropy profiles than more massive systems. This
appears to be due to a baseline entropy of 70-140 h50^-1/3 keV cm^2, depending
on the extent to which shocks have been suppressed in low mass systems. The
extra entropy may be present in all systems, but is detectable only in poor
clusters, compared to the entropy generated by gravitational collapse. This
excess entropy appears to be distributed uniformly with radius outside the
central cooling regions. We determine the energy associated with this entropy
floor, by studying the net reduction in binding energy of the gas in low mass
systems, and find that it corresponds to a preheating temperature of ~0.3 keV.
Since the relationship between entropy and energy injection depends upon gas
density, we can combine the excesses of 70-140 keV cm^2 and 0.3 keV to derive
the typical electron density of the gas into which the energy was injected. The
resulting value of 1-3x10^-4 h50^1/2 cm-3, implies that the heating must have
happened prior to cluster collapse but after a redshift z~7-10. The energy
requirement is well matched to the energy from supernova explosions responsible
for the metals which now pollute the intracluster gas.

radio galaxies spanning the redshift range 1 < z < 5. The primary aim of this
work is to elucidate the star-formation history of this sub-class of elliptical
galaxies by tracing the cosmological evolution of dust mass. Using SCUBA on the
JCMT we have obtained 850-micron photometry of 47 radio galaxies to a
consistent rms depth of 1 mJy, and have detected dust emission in 14 cases. The
radio galaxy targets have been selected from a series of low-frequency radio
surveys of increasing depth (3CRR, 6CE, etc), in order to allow us to separate
the effects of increasing redshift and increasing radio power on submillimetre
luminosity. Although the dynamic range of our study is inevitably small, we
find clear evidence that the typical submillimetre luminosity (and hence dust
mass) of a powerful radio galaxy is a strongly increasing function of redshift;
the detection rate rises from 15 per cent at z < 2.5 to 75 per cent at z > 2.5,
and the average submillimetre luminosity rises as (1+z)^3 out to z~4. Moreover
our extensive sample allows us to argue that this behaviour is not driven by
underlying correlations with other radio galaxy properties such as radio power,
radio spectral index, or radio source size/age. Although radio selection may
introduce other more subtle biases, the redshift distribution of our detected
objects is in fact consistent with the most recent estimates of the redshift
distribution of comparably bright submillimetre sources discovered in blank
field surveys. The evolution of submillimetre luminosity found here for radio
galaxies may thus be representative of massive ellipticals in general.

with an e-folding time of 14.4 d. The exponential decay was interrupted by an
increase in the X-ray flux, and a secondary maximum occurred 89 d after the

in other black hole candidate X-ray binaries. Most of the changes associated
with the transition occurred in less than 2 d. The timing changes include an
increase in the continuum noise level from less than 4% RMS to greater than 10%
RMS and the appearance of a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at 3.4 Hz with an
RMS amplitude of 7.3% in the 2-21 keV energy band. At the transition, the

the RXTE band pass. A change in the power-law photon index from 2.3 to 1.8,
also associated with the transition, occurred over a time period of 8 d. After
the transition, the source flux continued to decrease, and the QPO frequency
decayed gradually from 3.4 Hz to about 0.2 Hz.

is developed which explains all empirical trends and correlations in a large
number of cluster observables and provides a small but complete set of truly
independent constraints on theories of cluster formation and evolution in the

models, it is shown that (1) 39 regular (non--core-collapsed) globulars with
measured core velocity dispersions share a common V-band mass-to-light ratio of
1.45 +/- 0.10, and (2) a complete sample of 109 regular globulars reveals a
very strong correlation between cluster binding energy and total luminosity,
regulated by Galactocentric position: E_b \propto (L^{2.05} r_{\rm gc}^{-0.4}).
The observational scatter about either of these two constraints can be
attributed fully to random measurement errors, making them the defining
equations of a fundamental plane for globular clusters. A third, weaker
correlation, between total luminosity and the King-model concentration
parameter, c, is then related to the (non-random) distribution of globulars on
the plane. The equations of the FP are used to derive expressions for any

First, the spatial distribution of globulars in three large galaxies, together
with trends in total cluster population vs. galaxy luminosity for 97 early-type
systems plus the halo of the Milky Way, imply that bound stellar clusters
formed with a universal efficiency throughout early protogalaxies: by mass,
always 0.26% of star-forming gas was converted into globulars rather than halo
field stars. That this fraction is so robust in the face of extreme variations
in local and global galaxy environment suggests that any parcel of gas needs
primarily to exceed a relative density threshold in order to form a bound
cluster of stars. Second, it is shown that a strict, empirical scaling of total
binding energy with luminosity and Galactocentric position is a defining
equation for a fundamental plane of Galactic globular clusters. The
characteristics of this plane, which subsumes all other observable correlations
between the structural parameters of globulars, provide a small but complete
set of facts that must be explained by theories of cluster formation and
evolution in the Milky Way. It is suggested that the E_b(L,r_{\rm gc}) relation
specifically resulted from star formation efficiencies having been
systematically higher inside more massive protoglobular gas clumps.

scintillation shot noise, and correlator saturation. Modulation index, a single
number, can be biased by all of these, whereas the distribution of intensity is
affected in different ways by different effects, providing means of
distinguishing among them. Self-noise and gain variations are likely more
important at long observing wavelengths, and correlator saturation and
scintillation shot noise at short wavelengths. We find a size of about 500 km
at decimeter wavelengths. Interestingly, this agrees with measurements of
modulation index by Roberts & Ables at the same wavelength. Their results (and
more recently that reported by Macquart et al.) suggest that size decreases
with increasing wavelength. Although consistent with the observations, this
conclusion is perhaps surprising from the standpoint of the traditional
radius-to-frequency mapping. However, these measurements are of size rather
than height; and of course systematic effects may play a role.

in liquid and supercooled liquid states divides the motion into two parts:
oscillations within a given many-particle potential valley, and transit motion
which carries the system from one many-particle valley to another. Building on
this picture, we construct a model for the trajectory of an average atom in the
system. The trajectory consists of oscillations at the normal-mode distribution
of frequencies, representing motion within a fluctuating single-particle well,
interspersed with position- and velocity-conserving transits to similar
adjacent wells. For the supercooled liquid in nondiffusing states, the model
gives velocity and displacement autocorrelation functions which exactly match
those found in the many-particle harmonic approximation, and which are known to
agree almost precisely with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of liquid Na.
At higher temperatures, by allowing transits to proceed at a
temperature-dependent rate, the model gives velocity autocorrelation functions
which are also in remarkably good agreement with MD simulations of Na at up to
three times its melting temperature. Two independent processes in the model
relax velocity autocorrelations: (a) dephasing due to the presence of many
frequency components, which operates at all temperatures but which produces
zero diffusion, and (b) the transit process, which increases with increasing

temperature) is identified to a $c=1$ conformal field theory (CFT) with
compactified radius determined by the statistics parameter $\lambda$. Moreover,
this CFT can be put into a form of the harmonic fluid description for Luttinger
liquids, with the Haldane controlling parameter identified with the statistics
parameter (of quasi-particle excitations). Thus we propose to use the latter to
characterize the fixed points of 1-d Luttinger liquids. Such a characterization
is further shown to be valid for generalized ideal gas of particles with mutual
statistics in momentum space and for non-ideal gas with Luttinger-type

we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief

ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several
semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs.
Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic
constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as
modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for
default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic.
Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be
viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate,
the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy
different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result
explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two
semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with
autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind

are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time

that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for
randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal
notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use
both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate
the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as
clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We
demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of

nonthermal, indicating that a temperature is not defined. Moreover, the

relativistic solutions towards a part of the boundary of the state space that

Newtonian models and thus the relationship to the Newtonian solution space is
clearly displayed. It is numerically demonstrated that general relativistic
models have finite radii when the polytropic index $n$ satisfies $0\leq n
\lesssim 3.339$ and infinite radii when $n\geq 5$. When $3.339\lesssim n<5$,
there exists a 1-parameter set of models with finite radii and a finite number,

$AdS_7\times S_4$. As a side result, we obtain a lagrangian formulation of 7d
${\cal N}=2$ gauged sugra, which so far had only a on-shell formulation,
through field equations and constraints. The $AdS_7\times S_4$ ansatz
generalizes therefore all previous sphere compactifications to 7d. Then we
consider the case when the scalars in the lower dimensional theory are in a
coset $Sl(m+1)/SO(m+1)$, and we keep the maximal gauge group $SO(m+1)$. The
11-dimensional sugra truncated on $S_4$ fits precisely the case under
consideration, and serves as a model for our construction. We find that the
metric ansatz has a universal expression, with the internal space deformed by
the scalar fluctuations to a conformally rescaled ellipsoid. We also find the
ansatz for the dependence of the antisymmetric tensor on the scalars. We
comment on the fermionic ansatz, which will contain a matrix $U$ interpolating
between the spinorial $SO(m+1)$ indices of the spherical harmonics and the
$R$-symmetry indices of the fermionic fields in the lower dimensional sugra
theory. We derive general conditions which the matrix $U$ has to satisfy and we
give a formula for the vielbein in terms of $U$. As an application of our

under the global non-linear supersymmetry. As an interesting consequence, we
find a non-linear supersymmetric Born-Infeld action for a non-Abelian gauge
group for arbitrary D and N, which coincides with the linearly supersymmetric
Born-Infeld action in D=10 at the lowest order. For the gauge group U({\cal N})
for M(atrix)-theory, this model has {\cal N}^2-extended non-linear
supersymmetries, so that its large {\cal N} limit corresponds to the infinitely
many (\aleph_0) supersymmetries. We also perform a duality transformation from
F_{\mu\nu} into its Hodge dual N_{\mu_1...\mu_{D-2}}. We next point out that
any Chern-Simons action for any (super)groups has the non-linear supersymmetry
as a hidden symmetry. Subsequently, we present a superspace formulation for the
component results. We further find that as long as superspace supergravity is
consistent, this generalized Volkov-Akulov action can further accommodate such
curved superspace backgrounds with local supersymmetry, as a super p-brane
action with fermionic kappa-symmetry. We further elaborate these results to
what we call `simplified' (Supersymmetry)^2-models, with both linear and
non-linear representations of supersymmetries in superspace at the same time.
Our result gives a proof that there is no restriction on D or N for global
non-linear supersymmetry. We also see that the non-linear realization of
supersymmetry in `curved' space-time can be interpreted as `non-perturbative'
effect starting with the `flat' space-time.

the Cauchy-Szego kernel on the Heisenberg group, we calculate the traces on

different factorization problem, in which so-called characteristic pairs

one-optical-electron atoms (e.g. hydrogenlike or alkali atoms) and ions at
low-to-medium impact velocities (v/v_e <= 1) working on a modification of an
already developed classical Over Barrier Model (OBM) [V. Ostrovsky, J. Phys. B:
At. Mol. Opt. Phys. {\bf 28} 3901 (1995)], which allows to give a
semianalytical formula for the cross sections. The model is discussed and then
applied to a number of test cases including experimental data as well as data
coming from other sophisticated numerical simulations. It is found that the
accuracy of the model, with the suggested corrections and applied to quite
different situations, is rather high.

molecules. Using rate equations, we study theoretically the rupture of such
multiple parallel bonds under dynamic loading assisted by thermal activation.
For a simple generic type of cooperativity, both the rupture time and force
exhibit several different scaling regimes. The dependence of the rupture force
on the number of bonds is predicted to be either linear, like a square root or
logarithmic.

energy levels can store three qubits. The formalism allows to realize a
universal set of quantum gates. Feasible formalism implementation is suggested
which uses nuclear spin-7/2 as a storage medium and radio frequency pulses as
the gates. One pulse realization of all universal gates has been found,
including three-qubit Toffoli gate.
