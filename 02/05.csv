gives a positive cosmological constant at high significance.

a two-phase medium and of cold gas clouds with a clumpy substructure is
investigated. In optically thin clouds, the growth rate of small isobaric
density perturbations is independent of their length scale. However, the growth
of a perturbation is limited by its transition from isobaric to isochoric
cooling. The temperature at which this transition occurs decreases with the
length scale of the perturbation. Consequently small scale perturbations have
the potential to reach higher amplitudes than large scale perturbations. When
the amplitude becomes nonlinear, advection overtakes the pressure gradient in
promoting the compression resulting in an accelerated growth of the
disturbance. The critical temperature for transition depends on the initial
amplitude. The fluctuations which can first reach nonlinearity before their
isobaric to isochoric transition will determine the characteristic size and
mass of the cold dense clumps which would emerge from the cooling of an
initially nearly homogeneous region of gas. Thermal conduction is in general
very efficient in erasing isobaric, small-scale fluctuations, suppressing a
cooling instability. A weak, tangled magnetic field can however reduce the
conductive heat flux enough for low-amplitude fluctuations to grow isobarically
and become non-linear if their length scales are of order 0.01 pc. Finally, we
demonstrate how a 2-phase medium, with cold clumps being pressure confined in a
diffuse hot residual background component, would be sustained if there is
adequate heating to compensate the energy loss.

  288.1","27 pages with figures and tables, in press with ApJ",,"10.1086/308936",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss new Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy of the radio-loud quasar,
3C 288.1. The data cover ~590 A to ~1610 A in the quasar rest frame. They
reveal a wealth of associated absorption lines (AALs) with no accompanying
Lyman-limit absorption. The metallic AALs range in ionization from C III and N
III to Ne VIII and Mg X. We use these data and photoionization models to derive
the following properties of the AAL gas: 1) There are multiple ionization zones
within the AAL region, spanning a factor of at least ~50 in ionization
parameter. 2) The overall ionization is consistent with the ``warm'' X-ray
continuum absorbers measured in Seyfert 1 nuclei and other QSOs. However, 3)
the column densities implied by the AALs in 3C 288.1 are too low to produce
significant bound-free absorption at any UV-X-ray wavelengths. Substantial
X-ray absorption would require yet another zone, having a much higher
ionization or a much lower velocity dispersion than the main AAL region. 4) The
total hydrogen column density in the AAL gas is log N_H (cm-2)= 20.2. 5) The
metallicity is roughly half solar. 6) The AALs have deconvolved widths of ~900
km/s and their centroids are consistent with no shift from the quasar systemic
velocity (conservatively within +/-1000 km/s). 7) There are no direct
indicators of the absorber's location in our data, but the high ionization and
high metallicity both suggest a close physical relationship to the quasar/host
galaxy environment. Finally, the UV continuum shape gives no indication of a
``blue bump'' at higher energies. There is a distinct break of unknown origin
at ~1030 A, and the decline toward higher energies (with spectral index alpha =
-1.73, for f_nu ~ nu^alpha) is even steeper than a single power-law
interpolation from 1030 A to soft X-rays.

Hubble types from elliptical to irregular with emphasis on spirals at low
inclination angle, provides a valuable database for comparison with images of
high-z galaxies whose FUV light is redshifted into the optical and near-
infrared bands. Ultraviolet data are from the UIT Astro-2 mission. We present
images and surface brightness profiles for each galaxy, and we discuss the
wavelength-dependence of morphology for different Hubble types in the context
of understanding high-z objects. In general, the dominance of young stars in
the FUV produces the patchy appearance of a morphological type later than that
inferred from optical images. Prominent rings and circumnuclear star formation
regions are clearly evident in FUV images of spirals, while bulges, bars, and
old, red stellar disks are faint to invisible at these short wavelengths.
However, the magnitude of the change in apparent morphology ranges from
dramatic in early--type spirals with prominent optical bulges to slight in
late-type spirals and irregulars, in which young stars dominate both the UV and
optical emission. Starburst galaxies with centrally concentrated, symmetric
bursts display an apparent ``E/S0'' structure in the FUV, while starbursts
associated with rings or mergers produce a peculiar morphology. We briefly
discuss the inadequacy of the optically-defined Hubble sequence to describe FUV
galaxy images and estimate morphological k-corrections, and we suggest some
directions for future research with this dataset.

temperature. Among the cooler stars in the sample, at Teff ~ 8500 K, metal
abundances are in rough agreement with the canonical cluster metallicity, and
the v sin i rotations appear to have a bimodal distribution, with eight stars
at v sin i < 15 km/s and two stars at v sin i ~ 35 km/s. Most of the stars at
Teff > 10000 K, however, are slowly rotating, v sin i < 7 km/s, and their iron

Magnesium maintains a nearly constant abundance over the entire range of Teff,

Diffusion effects in the stellar atmospheres are the most likely explanation
for these large differences in composition. Our results are qualitatively very
similar to those previously reported for M13 and NGC 6752, but with even larger
enhancement amplitudes, presumably due to the increased efficiency of radiative
levitation at lower intrinsic [Fe/H]. We also see evidence for faster stellar
rotation explicitly preventing the onset of the diffusion mechanisms among a

the Hobby-Eberly Telescope to obtain optical spectra for several of our
sources; combining these spectra with archival data we find that the sources
appear to be active galaxies, often with narrow permitted lines, red optical
continua or hard X-ray spectra. Four of the X-ray sources are undetected to
R=21.7; if they reside in L* galaxies they must have z > 0.55-0.75 and hard
X-ray luminosities of L_{2-8} > 4x10^{42} erg s^{-1}. We detect all but one of
our 2-8 keV sources in the 0.2-2 keV band as well. This result extends to
significantly lower fluxes the constraints on any large, completely new
population of X-ray sources that appears above 2-3 keV.

WF/PC-1 and WFPC2 of stars in the Galactic Bulge have concluded that the old
population may not make up more then 30% of the total. Other studies using
HST/WFPC2 differential studies of `Bulge' globular clusters and field stars
have found the bulge to be comparable in age to the Galactic Halo. A
complication in all these studies is the presence of a substantial population
of stars which mimic a young bulge population, but which may be, and are often
assumed to be, foreground disk stars whose reddening and distance distributions
happen to mimic a young bulge turnoff. We show, using number counts in
HST/WFPC2 colour-magnitude diagrams of both field stars in the Bulge and of two
`bulge' and one `disk' globular cluster (NGC6528, NGC6553, and NGC5927) that
the stars interpreted as young in fact are foreground disk stars. Thus, we
confirm that the bulk of the bulge field stars in Baade's Window are old. The
existence of a young metal-rich population cannot, however, be ruled out from
our data. We also test for age and metallicity gradients using the CMD of a
metal-rich globular cluster as an empirical isochrone and derive a metallicity
difference of <0.2 dex between Baade's window and SGR-I window.

to approximately 4% of the studied time interval over which the acceleration is
documented. This rounding-off of the finite-time singularity is probably due to
a combination of well-known finite-size effects and friction and suggests that
we have already entered the transition region to a new regime. In theoretical
support, a multivariate analysis coupling population, capital, R&D and
technology shows that a dramatic acceleration in the population during most of

the evolution of the Yukawa couplings and show the following: 1. the CKM matrix
depends on the energy on only one function of energy; 2. the ratios of the down
quark masses depend on the energy through the same function as the CKM matrix;

relative corrections are of the order (\lambda ^{4}) for the quark Yukawa
