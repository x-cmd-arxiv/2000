  Euroconference Erice, 5-16 December 1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Galaxy structures are certainly fractal up to a certain crossover scale
\lambda_0. A clear determination of such a scale is still missing. Usually, the
conceptual and practical implications of this property are neglected and the
structures are only discussed in terms of their global amplitude. Here we
present a compact summary of these implications. First, we discuss the problem
of the identification of the crossover scale \lambda_0 and the proper
characterization of the scaling. We then consider the implications of these
properties with respect to various physical phenomena and to the corresponding
characteristic values, i.e. r_0, \sigma_8, \Omega, etc. These implications
crucially depend on the value of \lambda_0, but they are still important for a
relatively small value, say \lambda_0 \approx 50 \hmp. Finally we consider the
main theoretical consequences of these results.

  May",,"10.1086/316567",,"astro-ph",,"  Some QSOs show an abrupt, strong rise in polarization near rest wavelength
750 A. If this arises in the atmosphere of an accretion disk around a
supermassive black hole, it may have diagnostic value. In PG 1222+228, the
polarization rise occurs at the wavelength of a sharp drop in flux. We examine
and reject interpretations of this feature involving a high velocity outflow.
The observations agree with a model involving several intervening Lyman limit
systems, two of which happen to coincide with the Lyman continuum polarization
rise. After correction for the Lyman limit absorption, the continuum shortward
of 912 A is consistent with a typical power-law slope, alpha = -1.8. This
violates the apparent pattern for the Lyman limit polarization rises to occur
only in ``candidate Lyman edge QSOs''. The corrected, polarized flux rises
strongly at the wavelength of the polarization rise, resembling the case of PG
1630+377. The rise in polarized flux places especially stringent requirements
on models.

if the large entropy are produced at t $\sim$ 1 sec, the neutrinos are not
thermalized very well and do not have the perfect Fermi-Dirac distribution.
Then the freeze-out value of the neutron to proton ratio is altered
considerably and the produced light elements, especially He4, are drastically
changed. Comparing with the observational light element abundances, we find
that $T_R$ < 0.7 MeV is excluded at 95 % C.L. We also study the case in which
the massive particle has a decay mode into hadrons. Then we find that $T_R$

strongly interacting binary systems, where the mass-losing star is an evolved
giant star, e.g., an asymptotic giant branch star, is caused by an enhanced
mass loss rate during periastron passages. Tidal interaction by itself will
circularize the orbits of these systems in a relatively short time, hence a
mechanism which increases the eccentricity on a shorter time scale is required.
The proposed scenario predicts that the nebula formed by the mass loss process
possesses a prominent departure from axisymmetrical structure. Such a departure
is observed in the Red Rectangle, which has a central binary system, HD 44179,

While the characteristics of small-world networks are now fairly well

whether the small-world topology arises as a consequence of a tradeoff between
maximal connectivity and minimal wiring. Using simulated annealing, we study
the properties of a randomly rewired network as the relative tradeoff between
wiring and connectivity is varied. When the network seeks to minimize wiring, a
regular graph results. At the other extreme, when connectivity is maximized, a
near random network is obtained. In the intermediate regime, a small-world
network is formed. However, unlike the model of Watts and Strogatz (Nature {\bf

the formation of hubs, small clusters where one vertex is connected to a large

Abelian-like skeleton expansion, which allows one to disentangle
running-coupling effects from the remaining skeleton coefficients. The latter
are by construction renormalon-free, and hence hopefully better behaved. We
consider a simple ansatz for the expansion, where an observable is written as a
sum of integrals over the running-coupling. We show that in this framework one
can set a unique Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting procedure as an
approximation to the running-coupling integrals, where the BLM coefficients
coincide with the skeleton ones. Alternatively, the running-coupling integrals
can be approximated using the effective charge method. We discuss the
limitations in disentangling running coupling effects in the absence of a
diagrammatic construction of the skeleton expansion. Independently of the
assumed skeleton structure we show that BLM coefficients coincide with the
conformal coefficients defined in the small $\beta_0$ (Banks-Zaks) limit where
a perturbative infrared fixed-point is present. This interpretation of the BLM
coefficients should explain their previously observed simplicity and smallness.

scattering length of the two-body potential. We assume that the two-body
potential is short range and nonnegative. The amusing feature of this result is
that, in contrast to the three-dimensional case, the energy, $E_0$ is not
simply $N(N-1)/2$ times the energy of two particles in a large box of volume
(area, really) $V$. It is much larger.

element $\phi \in GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. We show that $M$ is the boundary of a
4-manifold fibered by tori over a surface such that the bundle structure on $M$
is the restriction of the bundle structure on the 4-manifold if and only if
$\phi$ is from the commutator subgroup $(GL(2,\mathbb{Z}))'$. The notions of
oriented and unoriented cobordisms in the class of closed 3-manifolds fibered
by tori are introduced. It turns out that in this case the cobordisms form a
group, namely $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ in the oriented case and
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ in the unoriented one. When the surface on
the base of oriented cobordism is orientable, it is shown that its minimal
genus can be calculated by Culler's algorithm.

--> Z_{(p)}-mod, where D is one of the standard categories which arise when
studying the homotopy theory of the classifying space of a finite group G,
e.g., the orbit category or the Quillen category of G. These higher limits are
of importance e.g., for the study of maps between classifying spaces as well as
for group cohomology.
  We show that these higher limits can be identified with the G-equivariant
Bredon cohomology of the subgroup complex of p-subgroups in G (i.e., the nerve
of the poset of p-subgroups in G) with values in a G-local coefficient system.
We examine when smaller complexes can be used e.g., taking only p-radical
subgroups, p-centric subgroups, elementary abelian p-subgroups or various
subcollections thereof.
  Since the subgroup complexes are finite complexes, and often rather small,
this provides concrete, computable formulas for these higher limits,
generalizing earlier work of especially Jackowski-McClure-Oliver.
  As an application we look at the special case where all the higher limits
vanish, as for example is the case for group cohomology. If F is a functor on
the orbit category our formulas for the higher limits in this case yield five
different expressions of F(G) in terms of values of F on proper subgroups. Two
of these are `classical' namely Webb's exact sequence of Mackey functors and a
formula for calculating stable elements, previously obtained using Alperin's
fusion theorem. Examining this case also leads to improvements of sharpness
results of homology decompositions due to Dwyer and others.

framework of the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory with
self-consistent finite-range pairing. Using 2-neutron separation energies of Ni
and Sn isotopes, the role of $\sigma$- and $\omega$-meson couplings on the
shell effects in nuclei is examined. It is observed that the existing
successful nuclear forces (Lagrangian parameter sets) based upon the nonlinear
scalar coupling of $\sigma$-meson exhibit shell effects which are stronger than
suggested by the experimental data. We have introduced nonlinear vector
self-coupling of $\omega$-meson in the RHB theory. It is shown that the
inclusion of the vector self-coupling of $\omega$-meson in addition to the
nonlinear scalar coupling of $\sigma$-meson provides a good agreement with the
experimental data on shell effects in nuclei about the stability line. A
comparison of the shell effects in the RHB theory is made with the Hartree-Fock
Bogoliubov approach using the Skyrme force SkP. It is shown that the
oft-discussed shell quenching with SkP is not consistent with the available
experimental data.
