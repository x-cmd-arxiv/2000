global array of 16 stations and yielded data on the total sample of 47 sources.
A subsample of 26 GPS sources with peak frequencies > 5 GHz and/or peak flux
densities > 125 mJy was observed with the VLBA at 15 GHz. A second subsample of
29 sources, with peak frequencies <5 GHz, was observed at 1.6 GHz using a 14

decomposition allowed us to identify 3, 11, 7, and 2 objects as compact
symmetric objects, compact doubles, core-jet and complex sources respectively.
  However, many of the sources classified as compact double or core-jet sources
show only two components making their classification rather tentative. This may
explain why the strong morphological dichotomy of GPS quasars and galaxies
found for radio-bright GPS sources, is not as clear in this faint sample.

radio sources using samples of faint and bright Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS)
and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. Correlations found between
their peak frequency, peak flux density and angular size provide strong
evidence that synchrotron self absorption is the cause of the spectral
turnovers, and indicate that young radio sources evolve in a self-similar way.
In addition, the data seem to suggest that the sources are in equipartition
while they evolve. If GPS sources evolve to large size radio sources, their
redshift dependent birth-functions should be the same. Therefore, since the
lifetimes of radio sources are thought to be short compared to the Hubble time,
the observed difference in redshift distribution between GPS and large size
sources must be due to a difference in slope of their luminosity functions. We
argue that this slope is strongly affected by the luminosity evolution of the
individual sources. A scenario for the luminosity evolution is proposed in
which GPS sources increase in luminosity and large scale radio sources decrease
in luminosity with time. This evolution scenario is expected for a ram-pressure
confined radio source in a surrounding medium with a King profile density. In
the inner parts of the King profile, the density of the medium is constant and
the radio source builds up its luminosity, but after it grows large enough the
density of th e surrounding medium declines and the luminosity of the radio
source decreases. A comparison of the local luminosity function (LLF) of GPS
galaxies with that of extended sources is a good test for this evolution
scenario [abridged].

statistical technique to determine the distribution of $\beta$ angles {\it in 3

analysis of the data, not differentiating between Seyfert 1's and 2's, showed
that the observed distribution of $i$ and $\delta$ values can be well
represented by a homogeneous $\beta-$distribution in the range
$0^{\circ}\leq\beta\leq90^{\circ}$. However, when we distinguished between
Seyfert 1's and 2's, the models could not represent Seyfert 1's adequately. It
was necessary to introduce viewing angle restrictions, that a galaxy can only
be recognized as a Seyfert 1 if the angle between the jet and the line of sight
($|\phi|$) is smaller than a given angle $\phi_c$ and that the galaxy
inclination $i$ is smaller than an angle $i_c$, in order to have statistically
acceptable models. This is a direct and independent confirmation of the
underlying concepts of the Unified Model. We discuss several ways to explain
the misalignment between the accretion disk axis and the host galaxy disk axis.

Primordial molecular clouds with ~10^5 solar masses are assembled by mergers of
multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with a
fractional abundance of ~10^-4. As the subclumps merge cooling lowers the
temperature to ~200 Kelvin in a `cold pocket' at the center of the halo. Within
this cold pocket, a quasi-hydrostatically contracting core with ~200 solar mass
and number densities > 10^5 cm^-3 is found. We find that less than 1% of the
primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and collapses to
sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star formation.
Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that this study achieved the highest
dynamic range covered by structured adaptive mesh techniques in cosmological
hydrodynamics to date.

5063 confirms and completes the one derived from previous Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) lower resolution observations. A strong interaction
between the radio plasma ejected from the nucleus and a molecular cloud of the
ISM is occurring at the position of the western hot spot, about 0.6 kpc from
the active nucleus. Because of this interaction, the gas is swept up, forming,
around the radio lobe, a cocoon-like structure where the gas is moving at high
speed. Due to this, part of the molecular gas is dissociated and becomes
neutral or even ionised if the UV continuum produced by the shocks is hard and
powerful enough. The main component detected in the VLBI HI absorption profile
has a central velocity of 2786 km/s and is therefore blue-shifted 614 km/s with
respect to the systemic velocity. Its peak optical depth is 5.4 %. The
corresponding column density of the detected absorption, for a spin temperature
of 100 K, is N_HI ~ 2x10^21 atoms cm^-2. The HI absorption properties observed

formation, with any currently known high redshift objects. We find that the

where a `seed' protobinary system forms, via fragmentation, within a collapsing
molecular cloud core and evolves to its final mass by accreting material from
an infalling gaseous envelope. This accretion alters the mass ratio and orbit
of the binary, and is largely responsible for forming the circumstellar and/or
circumbinary discs. Given this model for binary formation, we predict the
properties of binary systems and how they depend on the initial conditions
within the molecular cloud core. We predict that there should be a continuous
trend such that closer binaries are more likely to have equal mass components
and are more likely to have circumbinary discs than wider systems. Comparing
our results to observations, we find that the observed mass-ratio distributions
of binaries and the frequency of circumbinary discs as a function of separation
are most easily reproduced if the progenitor molecular cloud cores have radial
density profiles between uniform and 1/r (e.g. Gaussian) with near
uniform-rotation. This is in good agreement with the observed properties of
pre-stellar cores. Conversely, we find that the observed properties of binaries
cannot be reproduced if the cloud cores are in solid-body rotation and have
initial density profiles which are strongly centrally condensed. Finally, in
agreement with the radial-velocity searches for extra-solar planets, we find
that it is very difficult to form a brown dwarf companion to a solar-type star
with a separation < 10 AU, but that the frequency of brown dwarf companions
should increase with larger separations or lower mass primaries.

the Lya forest. The Discrete Wavelet Transform of a QSO spectrum is used to
decompose the light fluctuations that comprise the forest into orthogonal
wavelets. It is demonstrated that most of the signal is carried by the moderate
to lower frequency wavelets in high resolution spectra, and that a
statistically acceptable description of even high signal-to-noise spectra is
provided by only a fraction (10-30%) of the wavelets. The distributions of the
wavelet coefficients provide a statistical basis for discriminating between
different models of the Lya forest. The method is illustrated using the
measured spectrum of Q1937-1009. The procedure described is readily automated
and may be used to process both measured spectra and the large number of
spectra generated by numerical simulations, permitting a fair comparison
between the two.

we propose another: all of the moduli but the dilaton sit at points of enhanced
symmetry. The dilaton has a potential similar to those of racetrack models; it
is very massive and its dynamics do not break supersymmetry. The dilaton is
able to find the minimum of its potential because the energy is dominated by
non-zero momentum modes. This energy need not be thermal. The effective
potential for the dilaton is quite different from its flat space form. If
certain conditions are satisfied, the dilaton settles into the desired minimum;
if not, it is forced to weak coupling.
