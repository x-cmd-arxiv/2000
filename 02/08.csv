photoionization on the gas fraction in low mass objects, in particular the
characteristic mass scale below which the gas fraction is reduced compared to
the universal value. I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an
order of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if
one defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the
evolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass,
which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are
smoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the
characteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on
structure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a
single characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In
contrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal
history of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it
accounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas
distribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic
suppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to
find an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total
mass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple
fitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass. This simple
description of the probability distribution may be useful for semi-analytical
modeling of structure formation in the early universe.

fluctuations at small angular scales (less than one arcsec) is a second-order
contribution known as the Vishniac or Ostriker-Vishniac effect. This effect is
caused by the scattering of CMB photons off free electrons after the universe
has been reionized, and is dominated by linear perturbations near the R_V =2
Mpc/(h Gamma/0.2) scale in the Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. As the reionization
of the universe requires that nonlinear objects exist on some scale, however,
one can compare the scale responsible for reionization to R_V and ask if a
linear treatment is even feasible in different scenarios of reionization. For
an Omega_0 = 1 cosmology normalized to cluster abundances, only about 65% of
the linear integral is valid if reionization is due to quasars in halos of mass
10^9 solar, while 75% of the integral is valid if reionization was caused by
stars in 10^6 solar mass halos. In lambda or open cosmologies, both the
redshift of reionization and z_V are pushed further back, but still only 75% to
85% of the linear integral is valid, independent of the ionization scenario. We
point out that all odd higher-order moments from Vishniac fluctuations are zero
while even moments are non-zero, regardless of the gaussianity of the density
perturbations. This provides a defining characteristic of the Vishniac effect

galaxies from a redshift survey. The nonlinear biasing is characterized by the
conditional mean of the galaxy density fluctuation given the underlying mass
density fluctuation, or by the associated parameters of mean biasing and
nonlinearity (following Dekel & Lahav 1999). Using the distribution of galaxies
in cosmological simulations, at smoothing of a few Mpc, we find that the mean
biasing can be recovered to a good accuracy from the cumulative distribution
functions (CDFs) of galaxies and mass, despite the biasing scatter. Then, using
a suite of simulations of different cosmological models, we demonstrate that
the matter CDF is robust compared to the difference between it and the galaxy
CDF, and can be approximated for our purpose by a cumulative log-normal
distribution of 1+\delta with a single parameter \sigma. Finally, we show how
the nonlinear biasing function can be obtained with adequate accuracy directly
from the observed galaxy CDF in redshift space. Thus, the biasing function can
be obtained from counts in cells once the rms mass fluctuation at the
appropriate scale is assumed a priori. The relative biasing function between
different galaxy types is measurable in a similar way. The main source of error
is sparse sampling, which requires that the mean galaxy separation be smaller
than the smoothing scale. Once applied to redshift surveys such as PSCz, 2dF,
SDSS, or DEEP, the biasing function can provide valuable constraints on galaxy
formation and structure evolution.

demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations that the mean and dispersion of the

with strong jet-cloud interactions. Although the brightest emission line
components are closely aligned with the radio jets --- providing nearby
examples of the ``alignment effect'' most commonly observed in high redshift (z
> 0.5) radio galaxies --- lower surface brightness emission line structures are
detected at large distances (10's of kpc) from the radio jet axis. These latter
structures cannot be reconciled with anisotropic illumination of the ISM by
obscured quasar-like sources, since parts of the structures lay outside any
plausible quasar ionization cones. Rather, the distribution of the emission
lines around the fringes of the extended radio lobes suggests that the gas is
ionized either by direct interaction with the radio components, or by the
diffuse photoionizing radiation fields produced in the shocks generated in such
interactions. These observations serve to emphasise that the ionizing effects
of the radio components can extend far from the radio jet axes, and that deep
emission line imaging observations are required to reveal the true distribution
of warm gas in the host galaxies. We expect future deep imaging observations to
reveal similar structures perpendicular to the radio axes in the high-z radio
galaxies.

magnetic fluctuations by turbulence have been confined to the model of
white-noise-like advecting turbulent velocity field. In this work, the
statistics of the passive magnetic field in the diffusion-free regime are
considered for the case when the advecting flow is finite-time correlated. A
new method is developed that allows one to systematically construct the
correlation-time expansion for statistical characteristics of the field. The
expansion is valid provided the velocity correlation time is smaller than the
characteristic growth time of the magnetic fluctuations. This expansion is
carried out up to first order in the general case of a d-dimensional
arbitrarily compressible advecting flow. The growth rates for all moments of
the magnetic field are derived. The effect of the first-order corrections is to
reduce these growth rates. It is shown that introducing a finite correlation
time leads to the loss of the small-scale statistical universality, which was
present in the limit of the delta-correlated velocity field. Namely, the shape
of the velocity time-correlation profile and the large-scale spatial structure
of the flow become important. The latter is a new effect, that implies, in
particular, that the approximation of a locally-linear shear flow does not
fully capture the effect of nonvanishing correlation time. Physical
applications of this theory include the small-scale kinematic dynamo in the
interstellar medium and protogalactic plasmas.

A, taken with the NICMOS camera of the HST at a wavelength of 2.0 microns.These
maps reveal a highly collimated region of polarized emission straddling the
nucleus and extending to a radius of 1.2 arcseconds. Remarkably, this feature
coincides with one, but only one, limb of the edge-brightened bicone structure
seen in the total intensity image. The high degree (P_k ~ 25%) and orientation
of the extended polarization feature are consistent with a scattering origin.
Most plausibly, the detection of polarization along only one limb of the bicone
is a consequence of intrinsic anisotropy of the near-IR continuum within the
radiation cones, with the direction of maximum intensity of the near-IR
radiation field significantly displaced from the direction of the radio axis.
The unresolved nuclear core source is also highly polarized (P_k > 28%), with a
position angle close to the perpendicular to the radio axis. Given that this
high degree of nuclear polarization can only be explained in terms of dichroic
extinction if the dichroic mechanism is unusually efficient in Cygnus A, it is
more likely that the nuclear polarization is due to the scattering of nuclear
light in an unresolved scattering region close to the AGN. In this case, the
flux of the core source in the K-band is dominated by scattered rather than
transmitted quasar light, and previous extinction estimates based on K-band
photometry of the core substantially underestimate the true nuclear extinction.

Carlo (GFMC) simulations. The DMRG is most successful in 1-dimensional systems
and can only be extended to 2-dimensional systems for strips of limited width.
GFMC is not restricted to low dimensions but is limited by the efficiency of
the sampling. This limitation is crucial when the system exhibits a so-called
sign problem, which on the other hand is not a particular obstacle for the
DMRG. We show how to combine the virtues of both methods by using a DMRG
wavefunction as guiding wave function for the GFMC. This requires a special
representation of the DMRG wavefunction to make the simulations possible within
reasonable computational time. As a test case we apply the method to the
2-dimensional frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. By supplementing the
branching in GFMC with Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) we get a stable
simulation with a small variance also in the region where the fluctuations due
to minus sign problem are maximal. The sensitivity of the results to the choice
of the guiding wavefunction is extensively investigated. We analyse the model
as a function of the ratio of the next-nearest to nearest neighbor coupling
strength. We observe in the frustrated regime a pattern of the spin
correlations which is in-between dimerlike and plaquette type ordering, states
that have recently been suggested. It is a state with strong dimerization in
one direction and weaker dimerization in the perpendicular direction.

are parameterized by a dimensionless ``coupling constant'' $\beta$, the sign of
the cosmological constant, and an integer ``excitation number'' $n$. The
phenomenology we find is compared to the corresponding solutions found for the
Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) equations with positive $\Lambda$ (EYM$\Lambda$). If
we choose $\Lambda$ positive and fix $n$, we find a family of static spacetimes
with a Killing horizon for $0 \leq \beta < \beta_{max}$. As a limiting solution
for $\beta = \beta_{max}$ we find a {\em globally} static spacetime with
$\Lambda=0$, the lowest excitation being the Einstein static universe. To
interpret the physical significance of the Killing horizon in the cosmological
context, we apply the concept of a trapping horizon as formulated by Hayward.
For small values of $\beta$ an asymptotically de Sitter dynamic region contains
the static region within a Killing horizon of cosmological type. For strong

expressions of the form factors of the $\eeww$ amplitude and those of the

Goldstone bosons $\chi^\pm$, hence they hold within the expected accuracy of

amplitudes decouple in the heavy mass limit. This property is used to test the
overall normalization of the amplitudes. In order to observe the analytically
exact decoupling, the amplitudes are expanded by the $\bar{\rm MS}$ couplings
of the Standard Model. (iii) The high-energy analytic formulas of the helicity
amplitudes, which are verified by using the equivalence theorem analytically,
are used for the numerical test of the high energy behavior of the amplitudes.
We then investigate the magnitude of the one-loop effects on each helicity
amplitude which may be measured by experiments at future linear colliders.
Under the constraint from available precision data, the one-loop corrections to
a few helicity amplitudes (for example, the longitudinal-$W$-pair production)
can be at most from -0.8% to $+0.6$% in magnitude in the observables. The
corrections in the helicity-summed cross sections are smaller, typically a few
times $\pm 0.1$% at large scattering angles.

singularity corresponding to the sphere shrinking to zero volume. The naked
singularity is the source of an infinite attractive gravitational potential for
the fluctuating modes. Nevertheless, the spectrum is bounded from below,
continuous and positive definite, with the wave functions suppressed in the
region close to the singularity. The massless bound state is formally excluded
due to the boundary condition for the fluctuating mode wave functions at the
naked singularity. However, a regularisation of the naked singularity, for
example by effects of the order of the inverse string scale, in turn
regularises the gravitational potential and allows for precisely one (massless)
bound-state spin-2 fluctuating mode. We also contrast spectra in these domain
wall backgrounds with those of the domain walls due to the massless modes of
sphere reductions.
