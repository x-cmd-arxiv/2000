peak location to be in the range 175--243 and 151--259 respectively (both
ranges 95% confidence) and determine the peak amplitude to be between ~70 and
90 micro Kelvin. By combining all the data, we constrain the full-width at
half-maximum to be between 180 and 250 at 95% confidence. Such a peak is
consistent with inflation-inspired flat, cold dark matter plus cosmological
constant models of structure formation with adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant
initial conditions. It is inconsistent with open and defect models.

between the Doppler and eclipse maps reveal that the Keplerian velocities

emission becomes progressively fainter and redder for increasing disc radius --
reflecting the radial temperature gradient -- and reveal that the HI and HeI
lines appear as deep, narrow absorption features in the inner disc regions
transitioning to emission with P Cygni profiles for intermediate and large disc
radii. The spectrum of the uneclipsed component has strong HI and HeI emission
lines plus a Balmer jump in emission and is explained as optically thin
emission from a vertically extended disc chromosphere + wind. Most of the line
emission probably arises from the wind. The spatially-resolved spectra also
suggest the existence of gas stream ``disk-skimming'' overflow in UU Aqr, which

galaxies around a sample of luminous radio-quiet quasars. The K-band images,
obtained at UKIRT, are of sufficient quality to allow accurate modelling of the
underlying host galaxy. Initially, the basic structure of the hosts is revealed
using a modified Clean deconvolution routine optimised for this analysis. 2 of
the 14 quasars are shown to have host galaxies with violently disturbed
morphologies which cannot be modelled by smooth elliptical profiles. For the
remainder of our sample, 2D models of the host and nuclear component are fitted
to the images using the chi-squared statistic to determine goodness of fit.
Host galaxies are detected around all of the quasars. The reliability of the
modelling is extensively tested, and we find the host luminosity to be well
constrained for 9 quasars. The derived average K-band absolute K-corrected host
galaxy magnitude for these luminous radio-quiet quasars is <M_K>=-25.15+/-0.04,
slightly more luminous than an L* galaxy. The spread of derived host galaxy
luminosities is small, although the spread of nuclear-to-host ratios is not.
These host luminosities are shown to be comparable to those derived from
samples of quasars of lower total luminosity and we conclude that there is no
correlation between host and nuclear luminosity for these quasars.
Nuclear-to-host ratios break the lower limit previously suggested from studies
of lower nuclear luminosity quasars and Seyfert galaxies. Morphologies are less
certain but, on the scales probed by these images, some hosts appear to be
dominated by spheroids but others appear to have disk-dominated profiles.

Low Ionization Emission Line Region (LINER) hosted by Hydra A, a nearby
(z=0.0537) powerful FRI radio galaxy with complex radio and optical morphology.
In a 20 ks ACIS-S exposure during the calibration phase of the instrument, a
point source is detected at energies $\grtsim$ 2 keV at the position of the
compact radio core, embedded in diffuse thermal X-ray emission ($kT \sim 1$
keV) at softer energies. The spectrum of the point source is well fitted by a
heavily absorbed power law with intrinsic column density N$_H^{int} \sim 3
\times 10^{22}$ \nh and photon index $\Gamma \sim 1.7$. The intrinsic
(absorption-corrected) luminosity is $L_{2-10 keV} \sim 1.3 \times 10^{42}$
\lum. These results provide strong evidence that an obscured AGN is present in
the nuclear region of Hydra~A. We infer that the optical/UV emission of the AGN
is mostly hidden by the heavy intrinsic reddening. In order to balance the
photon budget of the nebula, we must either postulate that the ionizing
spectrum includes a UV bump or invoke and additional power source (shocks in
the cooling flow or interaction with the radio jets). Using an indirect
estimate of the black hole mass and the X-ray luminosity, we infer that the
accretion rate is low, suggesting that the accretion flow is advection
dominated. Finally, our results support current unification schemes for
radio-loud sources, in particular the presence of the putative molecular torus
in FR~Is. These observations underscore the power of the X-rays and of \chandra

supernova phenomenon, the structure of neutron stars, and in the mergers of
compact objects (neutron stars and black holes). During the collapse phase of a
supernova, the EOS at subnuclear densities controls the collapse rate, the
amount of deleptonization and thus the size of the collapsing core and the
bounce density. Properties of nuclear matter that are especially crucial are
the symmetry energy and the nuclear specific heat. The nuclear
incompressibility, and the supernuclear EOS, play supporting roles. In a
similar way, although the maximum masses of neutron stars are entirely
dependent upon the supernuclear EOS, other important structural aspects are
more sensitive to the equation of state at nuclear densities. The radii,
moments of inertia, and the relative binding energies of neutron stars are, in
particular, sensitive to the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy. The
dependence of the radius of a neutron star on its mass is shown to critically
influence the outcome of the compact merger of two neutron stars or a neutron
star with a small mass black hole. This latter topic is especially relevant to
this volume, since it stems from research prompted by the tutoring of David
Schramm a quarter century ago.

overlap for the four-dimensional Ising spin glass in the Migdal-Kadanoff
approximation. Similar to what is seen in three dimensions, we find that
temperatures well below those studied in Monte Carlo simulations have to be

the double-peak structure of the link overlap distribution function is related
to the difference between domain-wall excitations that cross the entire system

the peculiar ground state of an underlying quantum field theory leads to
consider the implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking through an
elementary scalar field. We point out that Bose-Einstein condensation implies
the existence of long-range order and of a gap-less mode of the (singlet)
Higgs-field. This gives rise to a $1/r$ potential and couples with
infinitesimal strength to the inertial mass of known particles. If this is
interpreted as the origin of Newtonian gravity one finds a natural solution of
the hierarchy problem. As in any theory incorporating the Equivalence
Principle, the classical tests in weak gravitational fields are fulfilled as in
general relativity. On the other hand, our picture suggests that Einstein
general relativity may represent the weak field approximation of a theory
generated from flat space with a sequence of conformal transformations. This
explains naturally the absence of a {\it large} cosmological constant from
symmetry breaking. Finally, one also predicts new phenomena that have no
counterpart in Einstein theory such as typical `fifth force' deviations below
the centimeter scale or further modifications at distances $10^{17}$ cm in
connection with the Pioneer anomaly and the mass discrepancy in galactic
systems.

superposition of type I parametric down conversion produced in two different
non-linear crystals pumped by the same laser, but with different polarisation.
The produced state is non-maximally entangled. We discuss the advantages and
the possible developments of this configuration.

on the environment induces a decomposition of the system state. Using
algorithmic information theory, we define the preparation information of a pure
or mixed state in a given decomposition. We then define an optimal
decomposition as a decomposition for which the average preparation information
is minimal. The average preparation information for an optimal decomposition
characterizes the system-environment correlations. We discuss properties and
applications of the concepts introduced above and give several examples.
