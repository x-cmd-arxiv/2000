of photons yet attain high angular resolution. Because X-ray telescopes utilize
grazing optics, to collect more photons requires a larger acceptance angle
which in turn compromises the angular resolution. All X-ray telescopes thus
have angular resolution far poorer than their diffraction limit. Although
collecting more photons is a desirable goal, sometimes selective collecting
fewer photons may yield more information. Natural (such as lunar) occultations
have long been used to study sources on small angular scales. But natural
occulters are of limited utility because of their large angular velocities
relative to the telescope, and because of the serendipity of their transits. We
describe here how one can make use of an X-ray Big Occulting Steerable
Satellite (X-BOSS) to achieve very-high resolution of X-ray sources. An X-BOSS
could significantly improve the resolution of existing X-ray facilities such as
the Chandra telescope, or X-ray Multiple Mirror (XMM) satellite, and could
vastly improve the resolution of some future X-ray telescopes, particularly
Constellation X where sub-milliarcsecond resolution is possible for a wide
range of sources. Similar occulting satellites could also be deployed in
conjunction with planned space observatories for other wavebands.

analyze the combined ROSAT/ASCA dataset for the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy, NGC 3227.
We show that the data are well fit by a combination of the lukewarm absorber

gaseous disk drives material inwards to form a proto-bulge. We start from the
standard picture of disk formation through the settling of gas into a dark halo
potential well, with the disk initially coming into centrifugal equilibrium
with detailed conservation of angular momentum. We derive generic analytic
solutions for the disk-halo system after adiabatic compression of the dark
halo, with free choice of the input virialized dark halo density profile and of
the specific angular momentum distribution. We derive limits on the final
density profile of the halo in the central regions. Subsequent viscous
evolution of the disk is modelled by a variation of the specific angular
momentum distribution of the disk, providing analytic solutions to the final
disk structure. The assumption that the viscous evolution timescale and star
formation timescale are similar leads to predictions of the properties of the
stellar components. Focusing on small `exponential' bulges, ones that may be
formed through a disk instability, we investigate the relationship between the
assumed initial conditions, such as halo `formation', or assembly, redshift
$z_f$, spin parameter $\lambda$, baryonic fraction $F$, and final disk
properties such as global star formation timescale, gas fraction, and
bulge-to-disk ratio. We find that the present properties of disks, such as the
scale length, are compatible with a higher initial formation redshift if the
re-distribution by viscous evolution is included than if it is ignored. We also

models is that the predicted abundance of galactic subhalos with circular

satellites actually observed within the Local Group. Using a simple model for
the formation and evolution of dark halos, based on the extended
Press-Schechter formalism and tested against N-body results, we show that the
theoretical predictions can be reconciled with observations if gas accretion in
low-mass halos is suppressed after the epoch of reionization. In this picture,
the observed dwarf satellites correspond to the small fraction of halos that
accreted substantial amounts of gas before reionization. The photoionization
mechanism naturally explains why the discrepancy between predicted halos and
observed satellites sets in at about 30 km/s, and for reasonable choices of the
reionization redshift (z_re = 5-12) the model can reproduce both the amplitude
and shape of the observed velocity function of galactic satellites. If this
explanation is correct, then typical bright galaxy halos contain many low-mass
dark matter subhalos. These might be detectable through their gravitational
lensing effects, through their influence on stellar disks, or as dwarf
satellites with very high mass-to-light ratios. This model also predicts a
diffuse stellar component produced by large numbers of tidally disrupted
dwarfs, perhaps sufficient to account for most of the Milky Way's stellar halo.

flare in the TeV and X-ray energy bands, lasting for about six days and with a
larger amplitude at TeV energies than in the X-ray band. At the peak of the TeV
flare, rapid TeV flux variability on sub-hour timescales is found. Large
spectral variations are observed at X-rays, with the 3--20 keV photon index of
a pure power law continuum flattening from $\Gamma=2.3$ to $\Gamma=1.8$ on a
timescale of 2--3 days. This implies that during the maximum of the TeV
activity, the synchrotron peak shifted to energies $\gtrsim 50$ keV, a behavior
similar to that observed during the longer-lasting, more intense flare in 1997
April. The TeV spectrum during the flare is described by a power law with
photon index $\Gamma=1.9$ and an exponential cutoff at $\sim$ 4 TeV; an
indication for spectral softening during the flare decay is observed in the TeV
hardness ratios. Our results generally support a scenario where the TeV photons

electron population responsible for the synchrotron X-rays. The simultaneous

connects with the smallest scale structure seen in VLA images. We have

matched-resolution images to ground-based images at higher frequencies and the
ability to measure high brightness temperatures. A spectral index map was made
by combining the VSOP 1.6 GHz image with a matched-resolution VLBA-only image
at 5 GHz from our VSOP observation on the following day. The spectral index map
shows the core to have a highly inverted spectrum, with some areas having a
spectral index approaching the limiting value for synchrotron self-absorbed
radiation of 2.5. Gaussian model fits to the VSOP visibilities revealed high
brightness temperatures (>10^{12} K) that are difficult to measure with
ground-only arrays. An extensive error analysis was performed on the brightness
temperature measurements. Most components did not have measurable brightness
temperature upper limits, but lower limits were measured as high as 5x10^{12}

are probably due to dynamical wind instabilities but not to eclipses. WR 140
featured a dip in the light curve, the amplitude increasing towards shorter
wavelengths. The probable cause is electron and Rayleigh scattering when the
star was eclipsed by a dust envelope. In the case of WR 148 we found a period
of 4.3 days and significant scatter in the light curves. Additionally there

radiation in cores of supernovae by evaluating the two-particle-two-hole

is carried out in the particle-particle channel to all orders in the
interaction. We show that at two loops there are two distinct sources of
coherence effects in the bremsstrahlung. One is the generically off-shell
intermediate state propagation, which leads to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal

obtained in the leading order in quasiparticle width, by deriving the exact
non-perturbative expression. A new contribution due to off-shell finial/initial
baryon states is treated in the leading order in the quasiparticle width. The
latter contribution corresponds to processes of higher order than second order
in the virial expansion in the number of quasiparticles. At 2p-2h level, the
time component of the polarization tensor for the vector transitions vanishes
identically in the soft neutrino limit. Vector current thereby is conserved.
The contraction of the neutral axial vector current with tensor interaction
among the baryons leads to a non-vanishing contribution to the bremsstrahlung
rate. These rates are evaluated numerically for finite temperature pure neutron
matter at and above the nuclear saturation density.

afterglow was measured few hours after the main event and for an elapsed time

its extreme, cosmological distance (z=3.42). The prompt event shows a hard
photon spectrum, consistent with a broken power law with photon indices
Gamma_X~0.1 below ~20 keV and Gamma_g~1.3 above 60 keV. The afterglow spectrum,
measured with the MECS and LECS BeppoSAX telescopes, is consistent with a power
law with spectral photon index Gamma=1.6. Within the statistical accuracy of
our measure no spectral evolution is detected during the observation of the
afterglow. When integrated during the time span covered by BeppoSAX
observations, the power in the afterglow emission, even with very conservative
assumptions, is at least comparable with the power in the main event. The
IR-to-X rays broad band spectrum is also presented, collecting data from the

values of the Lyapunov exponents have been calculated with the use of an
extended Lorentz-Boltzmann equation. In this paper we develop a method to
extend these results to higher density, using the BBGKY hierarchy equations and
extending them to include the additional variables needed for calculation of
Lyapunov exponents. We then consider the effects of correlated collision
sequences, due to the so-called ring events, on the Lyapunov exponents. For
small values of the applied electric field, the ring terms lead to
non-analytic, field dependent, contributions to both the positive and negative
Lyapunov exponents which are of the form ${\tilde{\epsilon}}^{2}
\ln\tilde{\epsilon}$, where $\tilde{\epsilon}$ is a dimensionless parameter
proportional to the strength of the applied field. We show that these
non-analytic terms can be understood as resulting from the change in the
collision frequency from its equilibrium value, due to the presence of the
thermostatted field, and that the collision frequency also contains such
non-analytic terms.

models is investigated for two- and three-dimensional lattices. Besides the
conventional signatures of phase transitions, here obtained through time
averages of thermodynamical observables in place of ensemble averages,
qualitatively new information is derived from the temperature dependence of
Lyapunov exponents. A Riemannian geometrization of newtonian dynamics suggests
to consider other observables of geometric meaning tightly related with the
largest Lyapunov exponent. The numerical computation of these observables -
unusual in the study of phase transitions - sheds a new light on the
microscopic dynamical counterpart of thermodynamics also pointing to the
existence of some major change in the geometry of the mechanical manifolds at
the thermodynamical transition. Through the microcanonical definition of the
entropy, a relationship between thermodynamics and the extrinsic geometry of
the constant energy surfaces $\Sigma_E$ of phase space can be naturally
established. In this framework, an approximate formula is worked out,
determining a highly non-trivial relationship between temperature and topology
of the $\Sigma_E$. Whence it can be understood that the appearance of a phase
transition must be tightly related to a suitable major topology change of the
$\Sigma_E$. This contributes to the understanding of the origin of phase
transitions in the microcanonical ensemble.

  Condensate of Alkali Atoms","6 pages, 3 figures, to be appeared in Phys.Rev.A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.62.063613",,"cond-mat",,"  The behavior of collective oscillations of a trapped boson-fermion mixed
condensate is studied in the sum rule approach. Mixing angle of bosonic and
fermionic multipole operators is introduced so that the mixing characters of
the low-lying collective modes are studied as functions of the boson-fermion
interaction strength. For an attractive boson-fermion interaction, the
low-lying monopole mode becomes a coherent oscillation of bosons and fermions
and shows a rapid decrease in the excitation energy towards the instability
point of the ground state. In contrast, the low-lying quadrupole mode keeps a
bosonic character over a wide range of the interaction strengths. For the
dipole mode the boson-fermion in-phase oscillation remains to be the eigenmode
under the external oscillator potential. For weak repulsive values of the
boson-fermion interaction strengths we found that an average energy of the
out-of-phase dipole mode stays lower than the in-phase oscillation.
  Physical origin of the behavior of the multipole modes against boson-fermion
interaction strength is discussed in some detail.

in space. We consider the potential to be close to one that is time periodic

constructed and the corresponding Schroedinger equation solved by Miller and
Akhmediev. Exact bound states, or breather modes, exist in the unperturbed
problem and are found to be generically metastable in the presence of small
periodic perturbations. Thus, these states are long-lived but eventually decay.
On a time scale of order $\epsilon^{-2}$, where $\epsilon$ is a measure of the
perturbation size, the decay is exponential, with a rate of decay given by an
analogue of Fermi's golden rule. For times of order $\epsilon^{-1}$ the
breather modes are frequency shifted. This behavior is derived first by
classical multiple-scale expansions, and then in certain circumstances we are
able to apply the rigorous theory developed by Soffer and Weinstein and
extended by Kirr and Weinstein to justify the expansions and also provide
longer-time asymptotics that indicate eventual dispersive decay of the bound
states with behavior that is algebraic in time. As an application, we use our
techniques to study the frequency dependence of the guidance properties of
certain optical waveguides. We supplement our results with numerical

the static field with respect to the polarization of the microwave field allows
us to investigate the effect of generalized time-reversal symmetry breaking on
the statistical properties of energy levels.

with 112Sn and 124Sn targets at projectile energies 30 and 50 MeV/nucleon. The
quasiprojectile observables were reconstructed using isotopically identified
charged particles with Z_f <= 5 detected at forward angles. The nucleon
exchange between projectile and target was investigated using isospin and
excitation energy of reconstructed quasiprojectile. For events with total
reconstructed charge equal to the charge of the beam (Z_tot = 14) the influence
of beam energy and target isospin on neutron transfer was studied in detail.
Simulations employing subsequently model of deep inelastic transfer,
statistical model of multifragmentation and software replica of FAUST detector
array were carried out. A concept of deep inelastic transfer provides good
description of production of highly excited quasiprojectiles. The isospin and
excitation energy of quasiprojectile were described with good overall
agreement. The fragment multiplicity, charge and isospin were reproduced
satisfactorily. The range of contributing impact parameters was determined
using backtracing procedure.

transfer provides detailed information on the deuteron wave function. This
determines the range dependence of the orbital and spin components of the one-

currents and of quark/gluon degrees of freedom, as well as the nucleon
component. The R-matrix boundary condition model combines all these effects,
predicting nucleon-nucleon reactions and the deuteron form-factors
simultaneously. A brief description of the model is followed by a comparison of
its results with data, emphasizing the restrictions placed on the model by ed
elastic form-factors.

"physics/0002019",,"Carlos Castro, Alex Granik","On M Theory, Quantum Paradoxes and the New Relativity","11 pages Tex file",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Recently a New Relativity Principle has been proposed by one of the authors
as the underlying physical and geometrical foundations of String and {\bf M}
Theory. It is explicitly shown that within the framework of the New Relativity
Theory, some Quantum Mechanical Paradoxes like the Einstein-Rosen Podolsky and
the Black Hole Information Loss, are easily resolved. Such New Relativity
Theory requires the introduction of an Infinite Dimensional Quantum Spacetime
as has been shown recently by one of us. This can be viewed as just another way
of looking at Feynman's path integral formulation of Quantum Mechanics. Instead
of having an infinite dimensional funcional integral over $all$ paths, smooth,
forwards and backwards in time, random and fractal, in a finite-dimensional
spacetime, one has a finite number of paths in an Infinite Dimensional Quantum
Spacetime. We present a few-lines proof why there is no such a thing as an {\bf
EPR} Paradox in this New Relativity theory. The reason is {\bf not} due to a
superluminal information speed but to a {\bf divergent} information charge
density. In the infinite dimensional limit, due to the properties of gamma
functions, the hypervolume enclosed by a $D$-dim hypersphere, of finite nonzero
radius, shrinks to zero : to a {\bf hyperpoint}, the infinite-dimensional
analog af a point. For this reason, Information flows through the
infinite-dimensional hypersurface of nonzero radius, but zero size, the
hyperpoint, in an instant. In this fashion we imbue an abstract mathematical
""point"" with a true physical meaning : it is an entity in infinite dimensions
that has zero hypervolume at nonzero radius . A plausible resolution of the
Information Loss Paradox in Black Holes is proposed.

are in relative motion so that both detectors, each in its own inertial
reference frame, are first to perform the measurement. The data always
reproduces the quantum correlations and thus rule out a class of collapse
models. The results also set a lower bound on the ""speed of quantum
