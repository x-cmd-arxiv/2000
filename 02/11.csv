quadruple system composed of a pair of low-mass spectroscopic binaries
separated by 0.8'' (38 AU), each with a K-dwarf primary. Images at wavelengths
ranging from 5 to 24.5 microns show unequivocally that the optically fainter
binary, HD 98800B, is the sole source of a comparatively large infrared excess
upon which a silicate emission feature is superposed. The excess is detected
only at wavelengths of 7.9 microns and longer, peaks at 25 microns, and has a
best-fit black-body temperature of 150 K, indicating that most of the dust lies
at distances greater than the orbital separation of the spectroscopic binary.
We estimate the radial extent of the dust with a disk model that approximates
radiation from the spectroscopic binary as a single source of equivalent
luminosity. Given the data, the most-likely values of disk properties in the
ranges considered are R_in = 5.0 +/- 2.5 AU, DeltaR = 13+/-8 AU, lambda_0 =
2(+4/-1.5) microns, gamma = 0+/-2.5, and sigma_total = 16+/-3 AU^2, where R_in
is the inner radius, DeltaR is the radial extent of the disk, lambda_0 is the
effective grain size, gamma is the radial power-law exponent of the optical
depth, tau, and sigma_total is the total cross-section of the grains. The range
of implied disk masses is 0.001--0.1 times that of the moon. These results show
that, for a wide range of possible disk properties, a circumbinary disk is far
more likely than a narrow ring.

observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star
structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of
the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density.
In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the
radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude
of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening, or those that
are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that
in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron
star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of
state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily
a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the
nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles.
  In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of
neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal
functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by
considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations,
due, respectively, to Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for
the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a
function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the presssure at the
core-crust interface.

reveals a wealth of newly identified interesting objects, including early
O-type supergiants, a high mass double-lined binary in the SMC, and, in the
LMC, a newly confirmed LBV (R 85), a newly discovered WR star (Sk-69 194), and
a newly found luminous B[e] star (LH85-10). We use the data to evaluate the
extent that each association is coeval, and for the ones with little age
spread, determine the turn-off masses of the unevolved stars, as a means of
finding the progenitor masses of LBVs and WRs. Our data is also used to find
the (minimum) bolometric corrections that apply to these evolved objects. We
find that WRs in the SMC come from only the highest mass stars (>70Mo), while
in the LMC the WNEs come from a wide range of masses---possibly all stars with
masses >30Mo pass though a WNE stage at LMC metallicities. In both the SMC and
LMC the WCs appear to come from the same mass range as do the WNs, a finding
that has important implications for interpreting the WC/WN ratio among Local
Group galaxies. LBVs appear to come from the very highest mass stars. The
Ofpe/WN9 stars, sometimes implicated in the ""LBV phenonomon"" come from very
modest mass stars, 25-35Mo, suggesting a different origin for their
variability. The BCs of WRs are considerably more negative than those of O-type
stars, with BC(WNE)=-6.0 mag and BC(WC4)=-5.5mag; more modest values are found
for the Ofpe/WN9 stars (-2 to -4 mag). These findings are consistent with

global galaxy properties with the submillimetre and find that there is a

greater star formation efficiencies (cf. Young 1999). The average gas-to-dust
ratio for the sample is 581 +/- 43 (using both atomic and molecular hydrogen),
significantly higher than the Galactic value of 160. We believe this
discrepancy is due to a cold dust component at T < 20 K. There is a suprisingly
tight correlation between dust mass and the mass of molecular hydrogen as
estimated from CO measurements, with an intrinsic scatter of ~50%.

exploded in 1006AD, Wellstein et al. (1999) have demonstrated that it could be
the remnant of the donor star in a pre-supernova Type Ia interacting binary, if
it possesses an unusually low mass. We show that, if it had a mass of 0.1-0.2
Msun, the SM star would lie at the same distance (~800pc) as the SNR as
estimated by Willingale et al. (1995). However, most distance estimates to

suggest that the SM star lies behind this SNR. Assuming the canonical subdwarf

to the theoretical primeval galaxy model of Lin and Murray (1992) based on the
inside-out, self-similar collapse of an isothermal sphere. In this model, star
formation among field galaxies is a protracted process. Galaxies are thought to

hypothesis and provide quantitative support for the model. The inferred
physical fireball parameters imply that protons may be accelerated to >10^20
eV, and the inferred GRB energy generation rate is similar to that required to
account for the observed flux of UHECRs.
  Strong suppression of UHECR flux is expected in this model above 10^19.7 eV,
due to proton interaction with CMB photons. Strong deviations from model flux
derived under the assumption of uniform source distribution is expected above
10^20 eV, due to source clustering. The flux above 10^20.5 eV is expected to be
dominated by few, narrow spectrum sources. While model predictions can not be
tested (with high confidence level) at present, the predicted signatures should
be observed with the planned Auger and Telescope-Array UHECR detectors.

of a large fraction, ~10%, of the fireball energy to accompanying burst of

several tens of events per year correlated with GRBs, and test for neutrino

photons with respect to X-rays. An important conclusion is that powerful AGNs
can be hidden even at mid-infrared wavelengths and, therefore, the nature of
luminous dusty galaxies cannot be always characterized by long-wavelength data
alone but must be complemented with sensitive hard X-ray observations.

The
model incorporates infall of cooling gas from a halo and outflow of hot gas
from a multiphase interstellar medium and a self-regulated model for star
formation. Hot gas is created by thermal evaporation of cold gas clouds in
supernovae remnants, and criteria are derived to estimate the characteristic
temperature and density of the hot component and hence the net mass outflow
rate. A number of refinements of the model are investigated, including a simple
model of a galactic fountain, the response of the cold component to the
pressure of the hot gas, pressure induced star formation and chemical
evolution. The main conclusion of this paper is that low rates of star
formation can expel a large fraction of the gas from a dwarf galaxy. Effective
feedback can therefore take place in a quiescent mode and does not require
strong bursts of star formation. Consequences for galaxy formation and damped
Ly alpha systems are discussed.

observed with the CANGAROO 3.8m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope. The

under different instrumental conditions with estimated threshold energies of
4.5 TeV (1996), 1.9 TeV (1997) and 2.5 TeV (1998) at zenith angles of ~30 deg.
Although no strong evidence of the gamma-ray emission was found, the lowest
energy threshold data of 1997 showed a marginal excess of gamma-ray--like
events at the 4.1 sigma significance level. The corresponding gamma-ray flux is
calculated to be (2.9 +/- 0.7) * 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 1.9 TeV. The
observations of 1996 and 1998 yielded only upper limits (99.5% confidence

excess is due to Very High-Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from the pulsar
nebula, our result, when combined with the X-ray observations, leads to a value
of the magnetic field strength ~5 micro G. This is consistent with the
equipartition value previously estimated in the X-ray nebula surrounding the
pulsar. No significant periodicity at the 150ms pulsar period has been found in
any of the three years' data. The flux upper limits set from our observations

non-Bravais lattices built up from elliptical dots is investigated. The Coulomb
interaction between the dots is considered in dipole approximation. Then only
the center of mass (c.m.) coordinates of different dots couple with each other.
This c.m. subsystem can be solved exactly and provides magneto- phonon like
collective excitations. The inter-dot interaction is involved only through a
single interaction parameter. The relative coordinates of individual dots form
decoupled subsystems giving rise to intra-dot excitations. As an example, the
latter are calculated exactly for two-electron dots.
  Emphasis is layed on qualitative effects like: i) Influence of the magnetic
field on the lattice instability due to inter-dot interaction, ii) Closing of
the gap between the lower and the upper c.m. mode at B=0 for elliptical dots
due to dot interaction, and iii) Kinks in the single dot excitation energies
(versus magnetic field) due to change of ground state angular momentum. It is
shown that for obtaining striking qualitative effects one should go beyond
simple cubic lattices with spherical dots. We also prove a more general version
of the Kohn Theorem for quantum dot lattices. It is shown that for observing
effects of electron- electron interaction between the dots in FIR spectra

transition from the ordered DO3 phase to the disordered A2 phase. The data are
analyzed in terms of an effective interface Hamiltonian for a system with
several order parameters in the framework of the linear renormalization
approach due to Brezin, Halperin and Leibler. We show that the model provides a
good description of the system in the vicinity of the interface. In particular,
we recover the logarithmic divergence of the thickness of the disordered layer

predicts that all order parameters vanish continuously at the surface with a
nonuniversal, but common critical exponent. However, we find different
exponents for the order parameter of the DO3 phase and the order parameter of
the B2 phase. Using the effective interface model, we derive the finite size
scaling function for the surface order parameter and show that the theory
accounts well for the finite size behavior of the DO3 ordering but not for that

  Haptotaxis is referred to motion induced by an adhesion gradient on a
substrate. The problem is solved within a local approximation where a
Rayleigh-type dissipation is adopted. The dynamical model is akin to the Rousse
model for polymers. A powerful gauge-field invariant formulation is used to
solve a dynamical model which includes a kind of dissipation due to bond
breaking/restoring with the substrate. For a stationary situation where the
vesicle acquires a constant drift velocity, we formulate the propulsion problem
in terms of a nonlinear eigenvalue (the a priori unknown drift velocity) one of
Barenblat-Zeldovitch type. A counting argument shows that the velocity belongs
to a discrete set. For a relatively tense vesicle, we provide an analytical
expression for the drift velocity as a function of relevant parameters. We find
good agreement with the full numerical solution. Despite the oversimplification
of the model it allows the identification of a relevant quantity, namely the
adhesion length, which turns out to be crucial also in the nonlocal model in
the presence of hydrodynamics, a situation on which we have recently reported

which is 2.2-\sigma away from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, could be
explained by the exchange of the heavy mass eigenstate Z_2 in the intermediate
state. The improvement over the SM can be found in \chi, \eta, \nu models,
where the total \chi^2 of the fit to the 26 data points decreases by about five
units, owing to the better fit to the atomic parity violation. Impacts of the
kinetic mixing between the U(1)_Y and U(1)' gauge bosons on the \chi^2-analysis
are studied. We find that the Z' model with (\beta_E, \delta)=(-\pi/4,0.2),
where \beta_E is the mixing angle between Z_\chi and Z_\psi bosons and \delta
denotes the kinetic mixing, shows the most excellent fit to the data: the total
\chi^2 decreases by about seven units as compared to the SM. We introduce the
effective mixing parameter \zeta, a combination of the mass and the kinetic
mixing parameters. The 95% CL lower mass bound of Z_2 can be shown as a
function of \zeta. A theoretical prediction on \zeta and the U(1)'gauge

  ""Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification"" held in
  Paris in September 1999",,,"CERN-TH/2000-046, NEIP-00-003","hep-th",,"  Supersymmetric domain-wall solutions of maximal gauged supergravity are
classified in 4, 5 and 7 dimensions in the presence of non-trivial scalar
fields taking values in the coset SL(N, R)/SO(N) for N=8, 6 and 5 respectively.
We use an algebro-geometric method based on the Christoffel-Schwarz
transformation, which allows for the characterization of the solutions in terms
of Riemann surfaces whose genus depends on the isometry group. The
uniformization of the curves can be carried out explicitly for models of low
genus and results into trigonometric and elliptic solutions for the scalar
fields and the conformal factor of the metric. The Schrodinger potentials for
the quantum fluctuations of the graviton and scalar fields are derived on these
backgrounds and enjoy all properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Special attention is given to a class of elliptic models whose quantum
fluctuations are commonly described by the generalized Lame potential
\mu(\mu+1)P(z) + \nu(\nu+1)P(z+\omega_1)+ \kappa(\kappa+1)P(z+\omega_2) +
\lambda(\lambda+1)P(z+\omega_1 +\omega_2) for the Weierstrass function P(z) of
the underlying Riemann surfaces with periods 2\omega_1 and 2\omega_2, for
different half-integer values of the coupling constants \mu, \nu, \kappa,
\lambda.

$SU(N)/Z_N$ and thereby is endowed with a non-trivial vacuum structure
(k-sectors). The static potential between adjoint charges, in the limit of
infinite mass, can be therefore obtained by computing Wilson loops in the pure
Yang-Mills theory with the same non-trivial structure. When the (Euclidean)
space-time is compactified on a sphere $S^2$, Wilson loops can be exactly
expressed in terms of an infinite series of topological excitations
(instantons). The presence of k-sectors modifies the energy spectrum of the
theory and its instanton content. For the exact solution, in the limit in which
the sphere is decompactified, a k-sector can be mimicked by the presence of
k-fundamental charges at $\infty$, according to a Witten's suggestion. However
this property neither holds before decompactification nor for the genuine
perturbative solution which corresponds to the zero-instanton contribution on
$S^2$.

that Hodge theory could be extended to (non compact) K\""ahler complete
manifolds, within the L^2 framework. Also, many vanishing theorems on
projective or K\""ahler manifolds rely on the Kodaira-Bochner-Nakano identity,
and thus possess natural L^2 versions. Our goal is to define canonical L^2
cohomology groups on any unramified covering of an analytic variety X, with
values in a coherent analytic sheaf on X. This cohomology shares all usual
properties of standard coherent sheaf cohomology (especially, exact sequences,
spectral sequences, vanishing theorems,...). These properties are obtained by
incorporating the information provided by L^2 estimates in the standard proofs,
with suitable adaptations. L^2 cohomology should provide a comfortable and
efficient framework for the study the geometry of coverings, by providing a
relevant fonctorial formalism. When the base variety is compact and the
covering is a Galois covering of group $\Gamma$, there is a $\Gamma$ action on
cohomology groups and a related concept of $\Gamma$-dimension. In that case, we
prove that the $\Gamma$-dimension of cohomology groups is finite, and we extend
Atiyah's L^2 index theorem to the case of arbitrary coherent sheaves. Finally,
if the base manifold is projective, L^2 analogues of the usual vanishing
theorems (Kodaira-Serre, Kawamata-Viehweg,...) are valid. Similar constructions
and results have also been studied by P. Eyssidieux.

toward a better understanding of the global concepts behind spinor
representations of surfaces in 3-space. The important new aspect is a
quaternionic-valued function theory, whose ""meromorphic functions"" are

theory on Riemann surfaces. The first results along these lines were presented
at the ICM 98 in Berlin. An important new invariant of the quaternionic
holomorphic theory is the Willmore energy. For quaternionic holomorphic curves
in the quaternionic projective line, i.e., the conformal 4-sphere, this energy
is the classical Willmore energy of conformal surfaces. Using these new
techniques, the article discusses the mean curvature sphere of conformal
surfaces in the 4-sphere, Willmore surfaces in the 4-sphere, Baecklund
tranformations of Willmore surfaces, super-conformal surfaces and twistor
projections, and a duality between Willmore surfaces in the 3-sphere and
minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space. Finally, a new proof of Montiel's

the nonlinear interaction between the breather and its internal mode always
leads to a slow growth of the breather amplitude and frequency. In case (ii),
corresponding to interaction between the breather and a standing-wave phonon,
the breather will grow provided that the wave vector of the phonon is such that
the generation of radiating higher-harmonics at the breather is possible. In
other cases, breather decay is observed. This condition yields a limit value

generated by ultrarelativistic heavy ions to produce exotic particles in
$\gamma\gamma$ fusion reactions. To estimate the background conditions for such
reactions we analyze various mechanisms of meson production in very peripheral
collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions at RHIC and LHC energies. Besides
$\gamma\gamma$ fusion they include also electromagnetic $\gamma A$ interactions
and strong nucleon-nucleon interactions in grazing $AA$ collisions. All these
processes are characterised by low multiplicities of produced particles.
$\gamma A$ and $AA$ events are simulated by corresponding Monte Carlo codes,
RELDIS and FRITIOF. In each of these processes a certain fraction of pions is
produced close to the mid-rapidity region that gives a background for the
$\gamma\gamma$ events. The possibility of selecting mesons produced in
$\gamma\gamma$ fusion events via different $p_t$ cut procedures is
demonstrated.

where individual nucleons are treated as (non point-like) partons of the
nucleus, is presented. All the necessary target-mass corrections to asymptotic
scaling are evaluated and a new scaling variable is obtained. Recent inclusive
data from Jefferson Lab are analyzed and shown to scale in terms of the new
variable. The new approach allows to extract in a model-independent way the
nucleon light-cone momentum distribution in the nucleus.
