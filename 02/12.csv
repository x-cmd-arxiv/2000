extremely strong emission and high variability. We examine multiwavelength
aspects of this event using radio, optical, soft and hard X-ray and TeV data.
We concentrate on the medium-timescale variability of the broadband spectra,
averaged over weekly intervals.
  We confirm the previously found correlation between soft and hard X-ray
emission and the emission at TeV energies, while the source shows only minor
variability at radio and optical wavelengths. The non-linear correlation
between hard X-ray and TeV fluxes is consistent with a simple analytic estimate
based on an SSC model in which Klein-Nishina effects are important for the
highest-energy electrons in the jet, and flux variations are caused by
variations of the electron density and/or the spectral index of the electron
injection spectrum.
  The time-averaged spectra are fitted with a Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC)
dominated leptonic jet model, using the full Klein-Nishina cross section and
following the self-consistent evolution of relativistic particles along the
jet, accounting for gamma-gamma absorption and pair production within the
source as well as due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation. The
contribution from external inverse-Compton scattering is tightly constrained by
the low maximum EGRET flux and found to be negligible at TeV energies. We find
that high levels of the X-ray and TeV fluxes can be explained by a hardening of
the energy spectra of electrons injected at the base of the jet, in remarkable
contrast to the trend found for gamma-ray flares of the flat-spectrum radio
quasar PKS 0528+134.

Newton Telescope (INT) to conduct a pixel-lensing survey towards M31. In this
paper we investigate what we can learn from pixel-lensing observables about the
MACHO mass and fractional contribution in M31 and the Galaxy for the case of
spherically-symmetric near-isothermal haloes. We employ detailed pixel-lensing
simulations which include many of the factors which affect the observables. For
a maximum MACHO halo we predict an event rate in V of up to 100 per season for
M31 and 40 per season for the Galaxy. However, the Einstein radius crossing
time is generally not measurable and the observed full-width half-maximum
duration provides only a weak tracer of lens mass. Nonetheless, we find that
the near-far asymmetry in the spatial distribution of M31 MACHOs provides
significant information on their mass and density contribution. We present a
likelihood estimator for measuring the fractional contribution and mass of both
M31 and Galaxy MACHOs which permits an unbiased determination to be made of
MACHO parameters, even from data-sets strongly contaminated by variable stars.
If M31 does not have a significant population of MACHOs in the mass range
0.001-1 Solar masses strong limits will result from the first season of INT
observations. Simulations based on currently favoured density and mass values
indicate that, after three seasons, the M31 MACHO parameters should be
constrained to within a factor four uncertainty in halo fraction and an order
of magnitude uncertainty in mass (90% confidence). Interesting constraints on
Galaxy MACHOs may also be possible. For a campaign lasting ten years,
comparable to the lifetime of current LMC surveys, reliable estimates of MACHO
parameters in both galaxies should be possible. (Abridged)

physical components, making use of their statistical independence. To test the
capabilities of this approach, we apply the ICA algorithm on sky patches, taken
from simulations and observations, at the microwave frequencies, that are going
to be deeply explored in a few years on the whole sky, by the Microwave

recovered down to a flux limit corresponding to $0.7\sigma_{CMB}$, where
$\sigma_{CMB}$ is the rms level of CMB fluctuations. The signal recovering

strategies for allowing the separation of detector properties from sky

developing a figure of merit (FOM) for dithering procedures based on their

measures how well the gain characteristics of the detector are encoded in the

Patterns similar to the antenna arrangements of radio interferometers with good

patterns for both deep surveys of limited sky areas and for shallow surveys. By
choosing a strategy that encodes the calibration in the observations in an

to binary millisecond pulsars) are formed via long-term, low-mass binary
evolution. After detachment from the Roche lobe, the hot helium cores have a
rather thick hydrogen layer with mass between 0.01 to 0.06$~M_\odot $. Due to
mixing between the core and outer envelope, the surface hydrogen content is 0.5
to 0.35, depending on the initial value of the heavy element (Z) and the
initial secondary mass. We found that the majority of our computed models
experience one or two hydrogen shell flashes. We found that the mass of the
helium dwarf in which the hydrogen shell flash occurs depends on the chemical
composition. The minimum helium white dwarf mass in which a hydrogen flash
takes place is 0.213$~M_\odot $ (Z=0.003), 0.198$~M_\odot $ (Z=0.01),
0.192$~M_\odot $ (Z=0.02) or 0.183$~M_\odot $ (Z=0.03). The duration of the
flashes (independent of chemical composition) is between few $\times 10^6 $
years to few $\times 10^7 $ years. In several flashes the white dwarf radius
will increase so much that it forces the model to fill its Roche lobe again.
Our calculations show that cooling history of the helium white dwarf depends
dramatically on the thickness of the hydrogen layer. We show that the
transition from a cooling white dwarf with a temporary stable hydrogen-burning
shell to a cooling white dwarf in which almost all residual hydrogen is lost in
a few thermal flashes (via Roche-lobe overflow) occurs between
0.183-0.213$~M_\odot $ (depending on the heavy element value).

that share many properties with ellipticals and are, in essence, present-day
protoellipticals. There is also tantalizing evidence that minor mergers of

such interactions. Because of its dissipative nature, it tends to get crunched
into molecular form, turning into fuel for starbursts and active nuclei.
Besides the evidence for ongoing interactions, signatures of past interactions

do, indeed, find that the Fe K-alpha lines and Compton ""reflection"" components,
which are hallmarks of the X-ray spectra of Seyferts galaxies, are weaker in
BLRGs by about a factor of 2. This observational result is in agreement with
the conclusions of other recent studies of these objects. We examine several
possible explanations for this systematic difference, including beaming of the
primary X-rays away from the accretion disk, a low iron abundance, a small
solid angle subtended by the disk to the primary X-ray source, and dilution of
the observed spectrum by beamed X-rays from the jet. We find that a small solid
angle subtended by the disk to the primary X-ray source is a viable and
appealing explanation, while all others suffer from drawbacks. We interpret
this as an indication of a difference in the inner accretion disk structure
between Seyfert galaxies and BLRGs, namely that the inner accretion disks of
BLRGs have the form of an ion-supported torus or an advection-dominated
accretion flow, which irradiates the geometrically thin outer disk.

simple real pole solutions. For quite some time, those solutions have been
considered interesting as models of cosmological shock waves. A coordinate
singularity on the wave fronts was removed by a transformation which induces a
null fluid with negative energy density on the wave front. This null fluid is
usually seen as another coordinate artifact, since there seems to be a general
belief that that this kind of solution can be seen as the real pole limit of
the smooth solution generated with a pair of complex conjugate poles in the
transformation. We perform this limit explicitly, and find that the belief is
unfounded: two coalescing complex conjugate poles cannot yield a solution with
one real pole. Instead, the two complex conjugate poles go to a different
limit, what we call a ``pole on a pole''. The limiting procedure is not unique;
it is sensitive to how quickly some parameters approach zero. We also show that
there exists no improved coordinate transformation which would remove the
negative energy density. We conclude that negative energy is an intrinsic part
of this class of solutions.

radiation in a black hole spacetime can be separated into four ordinary

radiation's amplitude is small enough that its own gravitation may be
neglected.) Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately compute solutions to
the separated radial equation (the Teukolsky equation), particularly in a
numerical implementation. The fundamental reason for this is that the Teukolsky
equation's potentials are long ranged. For non-spinning black holes, one can
get around this difficulty by applying transformations which relate the
Teukolsky solution to solutions of the Regge-Wheeler equation, which has a
short-ranged potential. A particularly attractive generalization of this
approach to spinning black holes for gravitational radiation (spin weight s =
-2) was given by Sasaki and Nakamura. In this paper, I generalize Sasaki and
Nakamura's results to encompass radiation fields of arbitrary integer spin
weight, and give results directly applicable to scalar (s = 0) and
electromagnetic (s = -1) radiation. These results may be of interest for
studies of astrophysical radiation processes near black holes, and of programs
to compute radiation reaction forces in curved spacetime.

images, three basic types of submanifolds are discovered: cones, tangentially
degenerate hypersurfaces, and torsal submanifolds. Moreover, for tangentially
degenerate submanifolds, a structural theorem is proven. By this theorem,
tangentially degenerate submanifolds that do not belong to one of the basic

transformation on the quantum cohomology rings of general type projective
hypersurfaces. This characterics is useful for explicit determination of the
form of the generalized mirror transformation. As applications, we rederive the
generalized mirror transformation up to $d=3$ rational Gromov-Witten invariants
obtained in our previous article, and determine explicitly the the generalized
mirror transformation for the $d=4, 5$ rational Gromov-Witten invariants in the
case when the first Chern class of the hypersurface equals $-H$ (i.e.,
$k-N=1$).

Schr\""{o}dinger equation reduced from the Klein-Gordon equation. Local
potentials are assumed, and phenomenological potential parameters are searched
energy-dependently for $\pi^{-} + ^{12}$C system so as to reproduce not only
elastic differential cross sections but also total elastic, reaction and total
cross sections at 13 pion incident energies from 120 to 766 MeV. The real and
imaginary parts of the local potentials thus obtained are shown to satisfy the
dispersion relation. The imaginary part of the potentials as a function of the
pion energy is found to peak near the $\Delta$(1232)-resonance energy. The
strong absorption radius of the pion projectile with incident energies near the
$\Delta$-resonance region is found to be about $1.6 A^{1/3}$ fm, which is
consistent with previous studies of the region where the decay of the
$\Delta$'s takes place in nuclei. The phenomenological local potentials are
then compared with the local potentials exactly phase-shift equivalent to
Kisslinger potentials for pion energies near the $\Delta$-resonance.

quantum systems, and discuss the practical advantages of this approach for
scaling up a quantum computer. Generalizing the methods of binary quantum
logic, we establish that arbitrary unitary operations on any number of d-level
systems (d > 2) can be decomposed into logic gates that operate on only two
systems at a time. We show that such multi-valued logic gates are
experimentally feasible in the context of the linear ion trap scheme for
quantum computing. By using d levels in each ion in this scheme, we reduce the
number of ions needed for a computation by a factor of log d.

owing to hyperfine interaction of nuclear spins with electronic magnetic
moments in antiferromagnetic structure, is considered. The neighbor nuclear
spins in such array are opposite oriented and have resonant frequencies
determined by hyperfine interaction constant, applied magnetic field value and
interaction with the left and right nuclear neighbor spins. The resonant
frequencies difference of nuclear spins, when the neighbor spins have different

resonant RF-pulses both for single nuclear spins and for ensemble of nuclear
spins with the same resonant frequency.
  A model for the NMR quantum computer of cellular-automata type based on an
one-dimensional homonuclear periodic array of spins is proposed. This model may
be generalized to a large ensemble of parallel working one-dimensional arrays
and to two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures.
