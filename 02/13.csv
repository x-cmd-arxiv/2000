Quintessence scenarios on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy
spectra. In this class of models a scalar field $\phi$, assumed to provide most
of the cosmic energy density today, is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci
curvature scalar $R$. We implement the linear theory of cosmological
perturbations in scalar tensor gravitational theories to compute CMB
temperature and polarization spectra. All the interesting spectral features are
affected: on sub-degree angular scales, the acoustic peaks change both in
amplitude and position; on larger scales the low redshift dynamics enhances the
Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect. These results show how the future CMB
experiments could give information on the vacuum energy as well as on the
structure of the gravitational Lagrangian term.

(CMBR) power spectrum from the static and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effects, and from the moving cluster of galaxies (MCG) effect. We conclude, in
agreement with other studies, that at sufficiently small scales secondary
fluctuations caused by clusters provide important contributions to the CMBR. At
$\ell \gtrsim 3000$, these secondary fluctuations become important relative to
lensed primordial fluctuations. Gravitational lensing at small angular scales
has been proposed as a way to break the ``geometric degeneracy'' in determining
fundamental cosmological parameters. We show that this method requires the
separation of the static SZ effect, but the kinematic SZ effect and the MCG
effect are less important. The power spectrum of secondary fluctuations caused
by clusters of galaxies, if separated from the spectrum of lensed primordial
fluctuations, might provide an independent constraint on several important
cosmological parameters.

pulse period of the neutron star, confirming that it originates from A 0535+26.
The source is weaker than in previous quiescence detections by two orders of
magnitude and should be in the centrifugal inhibition regime. We show that the
X-ray luminosity cannot be due to accretion on to the magnetosphere of the
neutron star. Therefore this detection represents a new state of the accreting
pulsar. We speculate that the X-ray emission can be due to some matter leaking
through the magnetospheric barrier or thermal radiation from the neutron star
surface due to crustal heating. The observed luminosity is probably compatible
with recent predictions of thermal radiation from X-ray transients in
quiescence. The detection of the X-ray source in the inhibition regime implies
a reduced density in the outflow from the Be companion during its disc-less
phase.

Fermi-liquid like corrections to thermodynamical quantities. (Except the
possible Curie-like contributions from the residual moments in the latter

depending on the sign of orbital couplings, can be either an open chain with an
isolated orbital doublet due to Kondo screening or it will flow to an
intermediate fixed point with the same LCBO as that of the two-channel Kondo

quadrupole levels and for crystal field splitting of the cation d orbitals.
This is achieved by mixing the orbitals of different symmetry on a site with
coupling coefficients driven by the Coulomb potentials up to octapole level.
The additional forces on atoms due to the self-consistency and polarizabilities
are exactly obtained by straightforward electrostatics, by analogy with the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem as applied in first-principles calculations. The model
correctly orders the zero temperature energies of all zirconia polymorphs. The
Zr-O matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, which measure covalency, make a
greater contribution than the polarizability to the energy differences between
phases. Results for elastic constants of the cubic and tetragonal phases and
phonon frequencies of the cubic phase are also presented and compared with some
experimental data and first-principles calculations. We suggest that the model
will be useful for studying finite temperature effects by means of molecular
dynamics.

state and thus result in the quantum decoherence in the BEC. Since the
effective coupling coefficients are mainly determined by the Rabi frequency of
the pump laser, the quantum decoherence process can be controlled by adjusting
