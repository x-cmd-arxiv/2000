underlying cosmological model. Constraints on cosmological parameters of cold
dark matter models have been derived from mass, temperature and luminosity
functions of clusters. We study the importance of including cluster formation
history and a correction for collapsed fraction of objects in determining the
cluster X-ray temperature function. We find that both effects are important. We
compare temperature functions obtained by using a power law approximation for
the mass variance normalized to X-ray clusters to those obtained by using a
COBE normalized full CDM treatment. We conclude that the temperature function
could be a powerful test on the average density of the Universe if we could
find the correct way of interpreting the data.

neutrinos. It is formed as a result of the dynamical evolution of a galactic
nucleus prior to its collapse into a massive black hole and formation of
high-luminosity AGN. This stage can be referred to as ``pre-AGN''. A dense
central stellar cluster in the galactic nucleus on the late stage of evolution
consists of compact stars (neutron stars and stellar mass black holes). This
cluster is sunk deep into massive gas envelope produced by destructive
collisions of a primary stellar population. Frequent collisions of neutron
stars in a central stellar cluster are accompanied by the generation of
ultrarelativistic fireballs and shock waves. These repeating fireballs result
in a formation of the expanding rarefied cavity inside the envelope. The
charged particles are effectively accelerated in the cavity and, due to
pp-collisions in the gas envelope, they produce high energy neutrinos. All high
energy particles, except neutrinos, are absorbed in the thick envelope.
Duration of this pre-AGN phase is about 10 yr, the number of the sources can be
\~ 10 per cosmological horizon. High energy neutrino signal can be detected by
underground neutrino telescope with effective area ~1 km^2.

Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations in two smallest compact
hyperbolic (CH) models are investigated. First, it is numerically found that
the expansion coefficients of low-lying eigenmodes on the two CH manifolds
behave as if they are Gaussian random numbers at almost all the places. Next,
non-Gaussianity of the temperature fluctuations in the (l,m) space in these
models is studied. Assuming that the initial fluctuations are Gaussian, the
real expansion coefficients b_{l m} of the temperature fluctuations in the sky
are found to be distinctively non-Gaussian. In particular, the cosmic variances
are found to be much larger than that for Gaussian models. On the other hand,
the anisotropic structure is vastly erased if one averages the fluctuations at
a number of different observing points because of the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness of the eigenmodes. Thus the dominant contribution to the
two-point correlation functions comes from the isotropic terms described by the
angular power spectra C_l. Finally, topological quantities: the total length
and the genus of isotemperature contours are investigated. The variances of
total length and genus at high and low threshold levels are found to be
considerably larger than that of Gaussian models while the means almost agree
with them.

This length is determined by both Josephson and magnetic couplings between
layers. At higher fields the plasma frequency is suppressed collectively and is
determined by elastic energy of the vortex lattice. Analyzing experimental
data, we find that (i) the wandering length becomes comparable with the London
penetration depth near T_{c}, (ii) at small melting fields (< 20G) the
wandering length does not change noticeably at the melting transition
demonstrating existence of the line liquid phase in this field range, and (iii)

parameter exists along each of these families of rays such that the modulus of

the appropriate boundary conditions, can be integrated systematically to reveal
the well-known solutions in the interaction region. In so doing the mystery
behind the origin of such solutions is removed. With the use of the field

precision measurements on the present knowledge of particle physics, both in
the framework of the Standard Model and of its most straightforward extensions.
In Chapter 1 we give a general overview of the electroweak sector of the SM and
of SUSY phenomenology. In Chapter 2 we deal with different definitions of the
electroweak mixing angle, with particular attention to the relation between the
phenomenological angle $\theta$ and the MS parameter $\hat\theta$. In Chapter 3
we use results found in the previous chapter to discuss in detail how both the
decoupling and the non-decoupling approach to the running of coupling constants
in the MS scheme produce the same numerical value of $m_{GUT}$, despite of the
different initial conditions. In Chapter 4 we derive simple analytical formulas
for the contribution of a chargino almost degenerate with the lightest
neutralino to electroweak observables, showing that in the case of wino
domination the study of oblique corrections allows a concrete improvement of
experimental bounds on chargino mass. Finally, in Chapter 5 we consider the
possibility of extra fermion generations, proving that they are strongly
disfavoured by the present experimental data if all particles are heavier that
Z-boson, while for the specific case of the extra neutrino around 50 GeV in
mass (still allowed by experimental data) the quality of the fit is not worse
than the SM.

(Phys. Rev. D53, 7157 (1996), Nucl. Phys. B473, 143 (1996)), confinement is
discussed in terms of an effective Sine-Gordon theory for the timelike
component of the gauge field A_0. But whereas in the references above the
fermion mass m is a Lagrangian parameter, we consider the m=0 case and ask
whether an effective S-G theory can again be derived with m replaced by the
dynamically generated mass Sigma which appears below T_{ch}, the critical
temperature for the chiral phase transition. The fermion and gauge sectors are
strongly interdependent, but as a first approximation we decouple them by
taking Sigma to be a constant, depending only on the constant part of the gauge
field. We argue that the existence of a low-temperature confining phase may be
associated with the generation of Sigma; and that, analogously, the vanishing
of Sigma for T > T_{ch} drives the system to its deconfining phase. The effect
of the gauge field dynamics on mass generation is also indicated. (38kb)

that the evolution transformation is a non-unitary canonical transformation of
creation and annihilation operators. This observation was one of the arguments
for the hypothesis that one should choose different representations of the
canonical commutation relations at different moments of time in the exact
quantum field theory. In this paper the contradiction is analyzed for the case
of a simple quantum mechanical model being an analog of the leading order of
the large-N field theory. On the one hand, this model is renormalized with the
help of the constructive field theory methods; the Hilbert space and unitary
evolution operator are constructed. On the other hand, the leading order of the
evolution transformation in the strong external field is shown to be
non-unitary. Thus, unitarity of evolution in the exact theory is not in
contradiction with non-unitarity of the approximate theory.
