that the lens map is characterized by secondary critical curves producing small

dispersion. 8 cores, 2 with continuum sources, 6 without, lie at a local
linewidth minimum and optical depth maximum. The CS spectra are optically thick
and generally self-absorbed over the full 0.2 pc extent of the map. We use the
line wings to trace outflows around at least 3, and possibly 4, of the
continuum sources, and the asymmetry in the self-absorption as a diagnostic of
relative motions between core centers and envelopes. The quiescent regions with
low N2H+ linewidth tend to have more asymmetric CS spectra than the spectra
around the continuum sources indicating higher infall speeds. These regions
have typical sizes ~5000 AU, linewidths ~0.5 km/s, and infall speeds ~0.05
km/s. The correlation of CS asymmetry with N2H+ velocity dispersion suggests
that the inward flows of material that build up pre-protostellar cores are
driven at least partly by a pressure gradient rather than by gravity alone. We
discuss a scenario for core formation and eventual star forming collapse
through the dissipation of turbulence.

assumption of deep mixing between the convective envelope and the hydrogen
burning shell. We find that the extent of the observed abundance anomalies, and
in particular the universal O-Na anticorrelation, can be totally explained by
mixing which does not lead to significant helium enrichment of the envelope. On
the other hand, models with extremely deep mixing and strong helium enrichment
predict anomalies of sodium and oxygen, which are much larger than the observed
ones. This latter result depends solely on the nucleosynthesis inside the
hydrogen burning shell, but not on the details of the mixing descriptions.
These, however, influence the evolution of surface abundances with brightness,
which we compare with the limited observational material available. Our models
allow, nevertheless, to infer details on the depth and speed of the mixing
process in several clusters. Models with strong helium enrichment evolve to
high luminosities and show an increased mass loss. However, under peculiar
assumptions, red giants reach very high luminosities even without extreme
helium mixing. Due to the consequently increased mass loss, such models could
be candidates for blue horizontal branch stars, and, at the same time, would be
consistent with the observed abundance anomalies.

  We find that decaying hypersonic turbulence possesses an exponential tail of

proportional to t exp (-ktv) for shock velocity jump v and mean initial
wavenumber k. In contrast to the velocity gradients, the velocity Probability
Distribution Function remains Gaussian with a more complex decay law.
  The energy is dissipated not by fast shocks but by a large number of low Mach
number shocks. The power loss peaks near a low-speed turn-over in an
exponential distribution. An analytical extension of the mapping closure
technique is able to predict the basic decay features. Our analytic description
of the distribution of shock strengths should prove useful for direct modeling
of observable emission. We note that an exponential distribution of shocks such

metallicity distribution derived from the (V-I) colors has a mean [Fe/H] =
-0.3, a near-complete lack of metal-poor clusters, and only a small metallicity
gradient with radius; it may, however, have two roughly equal metallicity
subcomponents, centered at [Fe/H] ~ 0.0 and -1.0. The luminosity distribution
(GCLF) has the Gaussian-like form observed in all other giant E galaxies, with
a peak (turnover) at V = 27.8, consistent with a Coma distance of 100 Mpc. The
radial profiles of both the GCS and the halo light show an unusually steep
falloff which may indicate that the halo of this galaxy has been tidally
truncated. Lastly, the specific frequency of the GCS is remarkably large: we
find S_N = 11 +- 2, resembling the central cD-type galaxies even though IC 4051
is not a cD or brightest cluster elliptical. A formation model consistent with
most of the observations would be that this galaxy was subjected to removal of
a large fraction of its protogalactic gas shortly after its main phase of
globular cluster formation, probably by its first passage through the Coma
core. Since then, no significant additions due to accretions or mergers have
taken place.

near $k = 0.04h$Mpc$^{-1}$ which cannot be considered statistically significant
based on this data alone. We do not detect a narrow peak at $k \sim

consider only two cases, that is, the models with the stable fluid
stratification in the whole interior and the models that are fully convective.
For simplicity we call these two kinds of models ""radiative"" and ""convective""
models in this paper. For both cases, we assume the deviation of the models
from isentropic structure is small. Examining the dissipation timescales due to
the gravitational radiation and several viscous processes for the polytropic
neutron star models, we find that the gravitational radiation driven
instability of the r-modes remains strong even in the non-isentropic models.
Calculating the rotational modes of the radiative models as functions of the
angular rotation frequency $\Omega$, we find that the inertial modes are
strongly modified by the buoyant force at small $\Omega$, where the buoyant
force as a dominant restoring force becomes comparable with or stronger than
the Coriolis force. Because of this property we obtain the mode sequences in
which the inertial modes at large $\Omega$ are identified as g-modes or the
r-modes with l=|m| at small $\Omega$. We also note that as $\Omega$ increases
from $\Omega=0$ the retrograde g-modes become retrograde inertial modes, which
are unstable against the gravitational radiation reaction.

models of Luttinger liquids with open boundaries. We first consider the
Tomonaga-Luttinger model using bosonization. For weak interactions the boundary
exponent of the power-law suppression of the spectral weight close to the
chemical potential is dominated by a term linear in the interaction. This
motivates us to study the spectral properties also within the Hartree-Fock
approximation. It already gives power-law behavior and qualitative agreement
with the exact spectral function. For the lattice model of spinless fermions
and the Hubbard model we present numerically exact results obtained using the
density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. We show that many aspects of
the behavior of the spectral function close to the boundary can again be
understood within the Hartree-Fock approximation. For the repulsive Hubbard
model with interaction U the spectral weight is enhanced in a large energy
range around the chemical potential. At smaller energies a power-law
suppression, as predicted by bosonization, sets in. We present an analytical
discussion of the crossover and show that for small U it occurs at energies
exponentially (in -1/U) close to the chemical potential, i.e. that bosonization
only holds on exponentially small energy scales. We show that such a crossover
can also be found in other models.

each layer has a high-index Landau level that is half-filled. Hartree-Fock
calculations indicate that, above a critical layer separation, the system
becomes unstable to the formation of a unidirectional coherent charge density
wave (UCCDW), which is related to stripe states in single layer systems. The
UCCDW state supports a quantized Hall effect when there is tunneling between
layers, and is {\it always} stable against formation of an isotropic Wigner
crystal for Landau indices $N \ge 1$. The state does become unstable to the
formation of modulations within the stripes at large enough layer separation.
The UCCDW state supports low-energy modes associated with interlayer coherence.
The coherence allows the formation of charged soliton excitations, which become
gapless in the limit of vanishing tunneling. We argue that this may result in a
novel {\it ``critical Hall state''}, characterized by a power law $I-V$ in
tunneling experiments.

total energy squared in the center of mass and $M_Z$ is the mass of the $Z$

uniform medium with resonance density. For all the other density distributions
(monotonically varying density, castle wall profile, etc.) the required width
$d_{1/2}$ is larger than $d_{min}$. The width $d_{min}$ depends on $s$, and for
$Z$-resonance channels at $s\sim M^2_Z$ we get that $d_{min}(s)$ is 20 times

Using this condition, we conclude that the matter effect is negligible for
neutrinos propagating in AGN and GRBs environments. Significant conversion can
be expected for neutrinos crossing dark matter halos of clusters of galaxies
and for neutrinos produced by cosmologically distant sources and propagating in

existence of remarkable consistent Kaluza-Klein sphere reductions of D=10 and

of the consistency of the full gauged SO(8) reduction on S^7 from D=11 was
given many years ago, but from a practical viewpoint a reduction to a smaller
subset of the fields can be more manageable, for the purposes of lifting
lower-dimensional solutions back to the higher dimension. The major complexity
of the spherical reduction Ansatze comes from the spin-0 fields, and of these,
it is the pseudoscalars that are the most difficult to handle. In this paper we
address this problem in two cases. One arises in a truncation of SO(8) gauged
supergravity in four dimensions to U(1)^4, where there are three pairs of
dilatons and axions in the scalar sector. The other example involves the
truncation of SO(6) gauged supergravity in D=5 to a subsector containing a

theory on anti-de Sitter spaces and conformal field theories is understanding
how location in the interior of spacetime is represented in the field theory.
It has recently been argued that the interior of the spacetime can be directly
probed by using intrinsically non-local quantities in the field theory. In
addition, Balasubramanian and Ross [hep-th/9906226] argued that when the
spacetime described the formation of an AdS_3 black hole, the propagator in the
field theory probed the whole spacetime, including the region behind the
horizon. We use the same approach to study the propagator for the BTZ black
hole and a black hole solution with a single exterior region, and show that it
reproduces the propagator associated with the natural vacuum states on these
spacetimes. We compare our result with a toy model of the CFT for the
single-exterior black hole, finding remarkable agreement. The spacetimes
studied in this work are analytic, which makes them quite special. We also
discuss the interpretation of this propagator in more general spacetimes,
shedding light on certain issues involving causality, black hole horizons, and
products of local operators on the boundary.

where AdS_4 supergravity arises from compactification of M-theory on a coset
space G/H and preserves N<8 supersymmetries. One focal point of my review is
that the complete spectrum of such N-extended supergravity can be determined by
means of harmonic analysis on the homogeneous space G/H. This spectrum can be
matched with the candidate conformal theory on the boundary, in this way
providing very non-trivial checks of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Furthermore,
this spectrum can be useful to study the representation theory of N-extended
supersymmetry on AdS_4, namely representation theory for the superalgebra of
Osp(N|4). I review Osp(N|4) representation theory, and derive the translation
vocabulary between states of AdS_4 supergravity and conformal superfields on
the boundary, by means of the double interpretation of Osp(N|4) unitary
irreducible representations. In the cases of N=2,3, using results from harmonic
analysis I give the complete structure of all supermultiplets. Harmonic
analysis as a method to determine spectra of supergravity compactifications is
explained. Calculations are explicitly performed in the case
G/H=M^111=(SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1))/(SU(2)xU(1)xU(1)), preserving N=2 supersymmetries.

Legendre distributions on manifolds with codimension two corners and use it to
give a direct construction of the resolvent kernel of H, $R(\sigma + i0)$, for
$\sigma$ on the positive real axis. In this approach, we do not use the
limiting absorption principle at any stage; instead we construct a parametrix
which solves the resolvent equation up to a compact error term and then use
Fredholm theory to remove the error term.

eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an effective Hamiltonian H consisting of the
Hamiltonian H_0 of the corresponding closed system and a non-Hermitian
correction term W arising from the interaction via the continuum of decay
channels. The eigenvalues E_R of H are complex. They are the poles of the
S-matrix and provide both the energies and widths of the states. We illustrate
the interplay between Re(H) and Im(H) by means of the different interference
phenomena between two neighboured resonance states. Level repulsion along the
real axis appears if the interaction is caused mainly by Re(H) while a
bifurcation of the widths appears if the interaction occurs mainly due to
Im(H). We then calculate the poles of the S-matrix and the corresponding
wavefunctions for a rectangular microwave resonator with a scatter as a
function of the area of the resonator as well as of the degree of opening to a
guide. The calculations are performed by using the method of exterior complex
scaling. Re(W) and Im(W) cause changes in the structure of the wavefunctions
which are permanent, as a rule. At full opening to the lead, short-lived
collective states are formed together with long-lived trapped states. The
wavefunctions of the short-lived states at full opening to the lead are very
different from those at small opening. The resonance picture obtained from the
microwave resonator shows all the characteristic features known from the study
of many-body systems in spite of the absence of two-body forces. The poles of
the S-matrix determine the conductance of the resonator. Effects arising from
the interplay between resonance trapping and level repulsion along the real
axis are not involved in the statistical theory.
