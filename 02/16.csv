Doppler tomography shows a clear two-armed spiral pattern pointing to spiral
shocks in the disk. The Balmer and He II maps also give evidence for the
presence of spirals. The eclipse as seen in the red continuum indicates a disk
radius of 0.31 times the orbital separation, which might be large enough to
explain the observed spiral shocks through excitation by the tidal field of the

number of CMB data sets have led to differing claims on the origin of the
Galactic contamination at low frequencies. de Oliviera-Costa {\em et al} (1999)
have presented work based on Tenerife data supporting the spinning dust
hypothesis. Since the frequency coverage of these data is ideal to discriminate
spectrally between spinning dust and free-free emission, we used the latest
version of the Tenerife data, which have lower systematic uncertainty, to study
the correlation in more detail. We found however that the evidence in favor of
spinning dust originates from a small region at low Galactic latitude where the
significance of the correlation itself is low and is compromised by systematic
effects in the Galactic plane signal. The rest of the region was found to be
uncorrelated. Regions that correlate with higher significance tend to have a
steeper spectrum, as is expected for free-free emission. Averaging over all
correlated regions yields dust-correlation coefficients of $180\pm47$ and
$123\pm16$ $\mu$K /MJy sr$^{-1}$ at 10 and 15 GHz respectively.
  These numbers however have large systematic uncertainties that we have
identified and care should be taken when comparing with results from other
experiments. We do find evidence for synchrotron emission with spectral index
steepening from radio to microwave frequencies, but we cannot make conclusive
claims about the origin of the dust-correlated component based on the spectral
index estimates. Data with higher sensitivity are required to decide about the
significance of the dust-correlation at high Galactic latitudes and other
Galactic templates, in particular H$_\alpha$ maps, will be necessary for
constraining its origin.

Low-energy photons that subsequently pass through the hot plasma will be

resolves the ""line-of-death"" objection to the synchrotron shock model.
Illuminated clouds near GRBs will form relativistic plasmas containing large

observations of galaxies, groups, clusters, and superclusters of galaxies. We
find remarkably good agreement between observations and simulations.
Specifically, we find that the simulated mass-to-light ratio increases with
scale on small scales and flattens to a constant value on large scales, as
suggested by observations. We find that while mass typically follows light on
large scales, high overdensity regions --- such as rich clusters and
superclusters of galaxies --- exhibit higher M/L_B values than average, while
low density regions exhibit lower M/L_B values; high density regions are thus
antibiased in M/L_B, with mass more strongly concentrated than blue light. This
is true despite the fact that the galaxy mass density is unbiased or positively
biased relative to the total mass density in these regions. The M/L_B antibias
is likely due to the relatively old age of the high density regions, where
light has declined significantly since their early formation time, especially
in the blue band which traces recent star formation. Comparing the simulated
results with observations, we place a powerful constraint on the mass density
of the universe; using, for the first time, the entire observed mass-to-light
function, from galaxies to superclusters, we find Omega =0.16+/-0.05.

It has been pointed out that the adaptive smoothing filters are more efficient
tools to resolve cosmic structures than the traditional spatially fixed
filters. We study weakly nonlinear effects caused by two representative
adaptive methods often used in smoothed hydrodynamical particle (SPH)
simulations. Using framework of second-order perturbation theory, we calculate
the generalized skewness parameters for the adaptive methods in the case of
initially power-law fluctuations.

weakly nonlinear evolution of the genus statistics and the area statistics.
Isodensity contour surfaces are often parameterized by the volume fraction of
the regions above a given density threshold. We also discuss this
parameterization method in perturbative manner.

The solutions are expressed in a closed form in terms of elementary functions,
for arbitrary baryonic mass fraction. They are obtained assuming $\Omega=1$ and
a time independent comoving Jeans wavenumber, $k_J$. By working with a time
variable $\tau\equiv \ln(t^{2/3})$, the evolution of the perturbations is
described by linear differential equations with constant coefficients. The new
equations are then solved by means of Laplace transformation assuming that the
gas and dark matter trace the same density field before a sudden heating epoch.
In a dark matter dominated Universe, the ratio of baryonic to dark matter
density perturbation decays with time roughly like $\exp(-5\tau/4)\propto
t^{-5/6}$ to the limiting value $1/[1+(k/k_J)^2]$. For wavenumbers
$k>k_J/\sqrt{24}$, the decay is accompanied with oscillations of a period $

powerful symmetry arising from the Law of Corresponding States. This symmetry
gives rise to an infinite order discrete group which is a generalisation of
Kramers-Wannier duality for the two dimensional Ising model. The duality group,
which is a subgroup of the modular group, is analysed and it is argued that
there is a quantitative difference between a situation in which the spin
splitting of electron energy levels is comparable to the cyclotron energy and
one in which the spin splitting is much less than the cyclotron energy. In the
former case the group of symmetries is larger than in the latter case. These
duality symmetries are used to constrain the scaling functions of the theory
and, under an assumption of complex meromorphicity, a unique functional form is
obtained for the crossover of the conductivities between Hall states as a
function of the external magnetic field. This analytic form is shown to give
good agreement with experimental data.
  The analysis requires a consideration of the way in which longitudinal
resistivities are extracted from the experimentally measured longitudinal
resistances and a novel method is proposed for determining the correct
normalisation for the former.

surfactants. When such a mixed vesicle binds an oppositely-charged object, its
membrane partially demixes: the adhesion zone recruits more charged surfactants
from the rest of the membrane. Given an unlimited supply of adhering objects
one might expect the vesicle to remain attractive until it was completely
covered. Contrary to this expectation, we show that a vesicle can instead
exhibit {\it adhesion saturation,} partitioning spontaneously into an
attractive zone with definite area fraction, and a repulsive zone. The latter
zone rejects additional incoming objects because counterions on the interior of
the vesicle migrate there, effectively reversing the membrane's charge. The
effect is strongest at high surface charge densities, low ionic strength, and
with thin, impermeable membranes. Adhesion saturation in such a situation has
recently been observed experimentally [H. Aranda-Espinoza {\it et al.}, {\sl

gravitational-wave detectors. Finite-size effects increase the thermoelastic
noise by a modest amount; for example, for the sapphire test masses tentatively
planned for LIGO-II and plausible beam-spot radii, the increase is less than or
of order 10 per cent. As a side issue, errors are pointed out in the currently
used formulas for conventional, homogeneous thermal noise (noise associated
with dissipation which is homogeneous and described by an imaginary part of the
Young's modulus) in finite sized test masses. Correction of these errors
increases the homogeneous thermal noise by less than or of order 5 per cent for
LIGO-II-type configurations.

that quantization, we obtain here a complete quantum theory which describes the

results achieved by Ashtekar about the existence of important quantum gravity
effects in the Einstein-Maxwell system at large distances from the symmetry

significant difference is that, in order to admit an approximate classical

metric fluctuations on the symmetry axis and argue that they are generally
relevant for all of the coherent states.

proves possible to generate global solutions. In this paper CCM is applied to
an exact two-parameter family of cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions

This requires a modification of the previously constructed CCM cylindrical code

million hadronic and 245 thousand leptonic events selected. These data lead to
a significantly improved determination of Z parameters. From the total cross
sections, combined with our measurements in 1990-92, we obtain the final
results: m_Z = 91189.8 +/- 3.1 MeV, Gamma_Z = 2502.4 +/- 4.2 MeV, Gamma_had =

the number of light neutrino species N_nu = 2.978 +/- 0.014. Adding our results
on the leptonic forward-backward asymmetries and the tau polarisation, the
effective vector and axial-vector coupling constants of the neutral weak

function $g_1(x)$ is independent of the factorization scheme chosen in defining
the quark spin density. Consequently, the anomalous gluon and sea-quark
interpretations for the deviation of the observed first moment of $g_1^p(x)$
from the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule are equivalent. While it is well known that the
total quark spin in the chiral-invariant (CI) factorization scheme (e.g. the
improved parton model) can be made to be close to the quark model expectation
provided that the gluon spin is positive and large enough, it is much less
known that, contrary to the gauge-invariant scheme (e.g. the MSbar scheme), the
quark orbital angular momentum in the CI scheme deviates even farther from the
relativistic quark model prediction. Recent developments in the NLO analysis of
polarized DIS data, orbital angular momentum and lattice calculations of the

possibly changing its R-form by a central grouplike element of A^* of order

background of radiation emitted by a semiconductor diode laser. Combining our
result with atomic structure calculations yields 1.20 +- 0.01 s for the
lifetime of 3d D_{3/2}. We also use quantum jump observations to demonstrate
photon anti-bunching, and to estimate background pressure and heating rates in
the ion trap.

is investigated. The capture of moving in the frequency domain femtosecond
colored soliton by a dispersive trap formed in an amplifying fiber makes it
possible to accumulate an additional energy and to reduce significantly the
soliton pulse duration. Nonlinear dynamics of the chirped soliton pulses in the
dispersion managed systems is also investigated. The methodology developed does
provide a systematic way to generate infinite ``ocean'' of the chirped soliton
solutions of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NSE) with varying
coefficients.

  http://publish.aps.org/eprint/gateway/eplist/aps1997apr14_001",,,"041497","physics.gen-ph",,"  It is argued that there is a connection between the fundamental forces of
electromagnetism and gravitation. This connection occurs because of: 1) the
fundamental significance of the finite and invariant velocity of light in
inertial reference frames in the special theory, and 2) the reliance of the
general theory of relativity upon the special theory of relativity locally in
spacetime. The connection between the fundamental forces of electromagnetism
and gravitation follows immediately from these two points. A brief review is
provided of: 1) the role of the finite and invariant velocity of light in
inertial reference frames in the special theory, and 2) certain fundamental
concepts of the general theory, including its reliance on the special theory
locally.

and the physical world in modern physics. Special relativity, general
relativity, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and other areas of
physics are explored. Each area is found to support the existence of a link
between the mind and the physical world. Research from psychology is also
presented indicating that there is a role for the discipline of psychology in
delineating the nature of this link.

cylindrical symmetry, and in the presence of a magnetic field. We find that the
azimuthal quantum number m takes the values m = 0,1,2... when we increase the
magnetic field. At critical values of the magnetic field, the ground state is
twice degenerate. The magnetisation shows an oscillatory behaviour and jumps at
critical values of the magnetic field. This phase transition could be seen in
the condensate of a dilute gas of charged bosons confined by a double-well
potential.

unaffected by local manipulations of these parts. It is described by quantities
invariant under local unitary transformations. Here we present, for a system of
two qubits, a set of invariants which provides a complete description of
non-local properties. The set contains 18 real polynomials of the entries of
the density matrix. We prove that one of two mixed states can be transformed
into the other by single-bit operations if and only if these states have equal
values of all 18 invariants. Corresponding local operations can be found
efficiently. Without any of these 18 invariants the set is incomplete.
  Similarly, non-local, entangling properties of two-qubit unitary gates are
invariant under single-bit operations. We present a complete set of 3 real
polynomial invariants of unitary gates. Our results are useful for optimization
of quantum computations since they provide an effective tool to verify if and
how a given two-qubit operation can be performed using exactly one elementary
two-qubit gate, implemented by a basic physical manipulation (and arbitrarily
many single-bit gates).
