universes dominated by collisional, strongly self interacting dark matter
(SIDM) and collisionless, weakly interacting dark matter (CDM). While SIDM
virialised halos are more nearly spherical than CDM halos, they can be
rotationally flattened by as much as 20% in their inner regions. Substructure
halos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag which are more rapid and severe
than their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction.
Lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor of
two smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detection
of tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy Carina suggests
that its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs
--- an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by CDM models but consistent
with SIDM. The orbits of SIDM satellites suffer significant velocity bias
$\sigma_{SIDM}/\sigma_{CDM}=0.85$ and are more circular than CDM,
$\beta_{SIDM}} \approx 0.5$, in agreement with the inferred orbits of the
Galaxy's satellites. In the limit of a short mean free path, SIDM halos have
singular isothermal density profiles, thus in its simplest incarnation SIDM is
inconsistent with galactic rotation curves.

method of ``reduced parallaxes'' in V, I, K and the reddening-free
``Wesenheit-index''. We compare our sample to those considered by Feast &
Catchpole (1997) and Lanoix et al. (1999).
  We stress the importance of two systematic effects which influence the
distance to the LMC: the slopes of the Galactic PL-relations and metallicity
corrections. In order to assess the influence of these various effects, we
present 27 distance moduli (DM) to the LMC, based on three different colours
(V,I,K), three different slopes, and three different metallicity corrections.
  The DM to the LMC based on the parallax data can be summarised as follows.
Based on the PL-relation in V and I, and the Wesenheit-index, the DM is 18.60
\pm 0.11 (\pm 0.08 slope)(^{+0.08}_{-0.15} metallicity), which is our current
best estimate.
  Based on the PL-relation in K the DM is 18.52 \pm 0.18$ (\pm 0.03 slope) (\pm
0.06 metallicity)(^{+0.10}_{-0} sampling bias}).
  The random error is mostly due to the given accuracy of the Hipparcos
parallaxes and the number of Cepheids in the respective samples. The terms
between parentheses indicate the possible systematic uncertainties due to the
slope of the Galactic PL-relations, the metallicity corrections, and in the
K-band, due to the limited number of stars. Recent work by Sandage et al.
(1999) indicates that the effect of metallicity towards shorter distances may
be smaller in V and I than indicated here.

unprecedented view of the recurrent systematic pulse shape changes associated
with the 35-day cycle of Hercules X-1, a phenomenon currently unique among the
known accretion-powered pulsars. We present observations of the pulse shape
evolution. An explanation for the pulse evolution in terms of a freely
precessing neutron star is reviewed and shown to have several major
difficulties in explaining the observed pulse evolution pattern. Instead, we
propose a phenomenological model for the pulse evolution based upon an
occultation of the pulse emitting region by the tilted, inner edge of a
precessing accretion disk. The systematic and repeating pulse shape changes
require a resolved occultation of the pulse emission region. The observed pulse
profile motivates the need for a pulsar beam consisting of a composite coaxial
pencil and fan beam but the observed evolution pattern requires the fan beam to
be focused around the neutron star and beamed in the antipodal direction. The
spectral hardness of the pencil beam component suggests an origin at the
magnetic polar cap, with the relatively softer fan beam emission produced by
backscattering from within the accretion column, qualitatively consistent with
several theoretical models for X-ray emission from the accretion column of an
accreting neutron star.

function and the distribution of times at which isolated halos of a given mass
exist. By assuming that clumps of dark matter undergo monotonic growth on the
time-scales of interest, this distribution of times is also the distribution of
`creation' times of the halos. This monotonic growth is an inevitable aspect of
gravitational instability. The spherical top-hat collapse model is used to
estimate the rate at which clumps of dark matter collapse. This gives the prior
for the creation time given no information about halo mass. Applying Bayes'
theorem then allows any mass function to be converted into a distribution of
times at which halos of a given mass are created. This general result covers
both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. We also demonstrate how the mass
function and the creation time distribution can be combined to give a joint
density function, and discuss the relation between the time distribution of
major merger events and the formula calculated. Finally, we determine the
creation time of halos within three N-body simulations, and compare the link
between the mass function and creation rate with the analytic theory.

cusps. Primordial velocity dispersion is characterised by a ``phase density''
$Q\equiv \rho/<v^2>^{3/2}$, which for relativistically-decoupled relics is
determined by particle mass and spin and is insensitive to cosmological
parameters. Finite $Q$ leads to small-scale filtering of the primordial power
spectrum, which reduces substructure, and limits the maximum central density of
halos, which eliminates central cusps. The relationship between $Q$ and halo
observables is estimated. The primordial $Q$ may be preserved in the cores of
halos and if so leads to a predicted relation, closely analogous to that in
degenerate dwarf stars, between the central density and velocity dispersion.
Classical polytrope solutions are used to model the structure of halos of
collisional dark matter, and to show that self-interactions in halos today are
probably not significant because they destabilize halo cores via heat
conduction. Constraints on masses and self-interactions of dark matter
particles are estimated from halo stability and other considerations.

complementary to those found either in studies of CMB anisotropies or of

deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to
comparison with solar isotopic abundances. We found that (1) to avoid too large
ratios of $^{54}$Cr/$^{56}$Fe and $^{50}$Ti/$^{56}$Fe, the ignition density
should be as low as \ltsim 2 \e9 \gmc, and that (2) to avoid the overproduction

the sound speed in the central low $Y_e$ layers, or the progenitor star has to
be metal-poor compared with solar. Such low central densities can be realized
by a rapid accretion as fast as $\dot M$ \gtsim 1 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$M$_\odot$

needs progenitor systems that undergo ignition at higher densities. We also

of elements like Mn and Cr (incomplete Si-burning ashes), depend on the density
of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed detonations. Our

downstream from the wind critical point lead to convergence towards the
critical solution. By contrast, low-lying perturbations cause evolution towards

Such a wind differs fundamentally from the critical solution. For sufficiently

form a broad sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, whose slope is much
steeper than that expected from metallicity variations within a passively

provide clear evidence that electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies
in supernova remnants (SNRs). However, a viable mechanism for the
pre-acceleration of such electrons to mildly relativistic energies has not yet
been established. In this paper an electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code
is used to simulate acceleration of electrons from background energies to tens
of keV at perpendicular collisionless shocks associated with SNRs. Free energy
for electron energization is provided by ions reflected from the shock front,
with speeds greater than the upstream electron thermal speed. The PIC
simulation results contain several new features, including: the acceleration,
rather than heating, of electrons via the Buneman instability; the acceleration
of electrons to speeds exceeding those of the shock-reflected ions producing
the instability; and strong acceleration of electrons perpendicular to the
magnetic field. Electron energization takes place through a variety of resonant
and non-resonant processes, of which the strongest involves stochastic
wave-particle interactions. In SNRs the diffusive shock process could then
supply the final step required for the production of fully relativistic
electrons. The mechanisms identified in this paper thus provide a possible
solution to the electron pre-acceleration problem.

of excitonic ordering. At stoichiometry, the model reduces in the strong
coupling limit to a pseudo-spin model with approximate U(4) symmetry. Excitonic
order appears in the pseudo-spin model as in-plane pseudo-magnetism. The U(4)
symmetry unifies all possible singlet and triplet order parameters describing
such states. Super-exchange, Hunds-rule coupling, and other perturbations act
as anisotropies splitting the U(4) manifold, ultimately stabilizing a
paramagnetic triplet state. The tendency to ferromagnetism with doping
(observed experimentally in the hexaborides) is explained as a spin-flop
transition to a different orientation of the U(4) order parameter. The physical
mechanism favoring such a reorientation is the enhanced coherence (and hence
lower kinetic energy) of the doped electrons in a ferromagnetic background
relative to the paramagnet. A discussion of the physical meaning of various
excitonic states and their experimental consequences is also provided.

The basic features needed in modeling of this adsorption are discussed. We
first discuss the adsorption of a single and long polymer chain to the surface.
The surface interaction is modeled by a potential well with a long-ranged
attractive tail. A simple mean-field theory description is presented and the
concept of polymer ""blobs"" is used to describe the conformation of the chain at
the surface. The thickness of the adsorbed layer depends on several polymer and
surface parameters. Fluctuation corrections to mean-field theory are also
discussed. We then review adsorption as well as depletion processes in the
many-chain case. Profiles, changes in the surface tension and polymer surface
excess are calculated within mean-field theory. Corrections due to fluctuations
in good solvent are taken into account using scaling concepts. The proximal
exponent is introduced in analogy to surface critical phenomena. The
interaction between two surfaces with adsorbed polymer layers is discussed, and
various cases leading to attractive and repulsive interactions are mentioned.
Polyelectrolytes are of practical importance due to their water solubility; we
give a short summary of recent progress in this rapidly evolving field. The
behavior of grafted polymers, i.e., polymers which are anchored with one end to
a solid substrate is also reviewed.

When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of

enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the

propagating in extra dimensions. In the scenario of large extra dimensions,
proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, graviscalar Kaluza-Klein
excitations are less important than the spin-2 counterparts in most processes.
However, there are important exceptions. The Higgs boson can mix to these
particles by coupling to the Ricci scalar. Because of the large number of
states involved, this mixing leads, in practice, to a sizeable invisible width
for the Higgs. In the Randall-Sundrum scenario, the only graviscalar is the
radion. It can be produced copiously at hadron colliders by virtue of its
enhanced coupling to two gluons through the trace anomaly of QCD. We study both
the production and decay of the radion, and compare it to the Standard Model
Higgs boson. Furthermore, we find that radion detectability depends crucially
on the curvature-Higgs boson mixing parameter.

generalizations to algebraic and symplectic geometry. A natural
algebro-geometric generalization studied in our prior work involves random
holomorphic sections $H^0(M,L^N)$ of the powers of any positive line bundle $L
\to M$ over any complex manifold. Our main interest is in the statistics of
zeros of $k$ independent sections (generalized polynomials) of degree $N$ as
$N\to\infty$. We fix a point $P$ and focus on the ball of radius $1/\sqrt{N}$
about $P$. Under a microscope magnifying the ball by the factor $\sqrt{N}$, the
statistics of the configurations of simultaneous zeros of random $k$-tuples of
sections tends to a universal limit independent of $P,M,L$. We review this
result and generalize it further to the case of pre-quantum line bundles over
almost-complex symplectic manifolds $(M,J,\omega)$. Following [SZ2], we replace
$H^0(M,L^N)$ in the complex case with the `asymptotically holomorphic' sections
defined by Boutet de Monvel-Guillemin and (from another point of view) by
Donaldson and Auroux. Using a generalization to an $m$-dimensional setting of
the Kac-Rice formula for zero correlations together with the results of [SZ2],
we prove that the scaling limits of the correlation functions for zeros of
random $k$-tuples of asymptotically holomorphic sections belong to the same
universality class as in the complex case.

  substantially improved",,,,"math.GT",,"  We generalize Turaev's definition of torsion invariants of pairs (M,x), where
M is a 3-dimensional manifold and x is an Euler structure on M (a non-singular
vector field up to homotopy relative to bM and local modifications in int(M).
Namely, we allow M to have arbitrary boundary and x to have simple (convex
and/or concave) tangency circles to the boundary. We prove that Turaev's
H_1(M)-equivariance formula holds also in our generalized context. Our torsions
apply in particular to (the exterior of) pseudo-Legendrian knots (i.e. knots
transversal to a given vector field), and hence to Legendrian knots in contact
3-manifolds. We show that torsion, as an absolute invariant, contains a lifting
to pseudo-Legendrian knots of the classical Alexander invariant. We also
precisely analyze the information carried by torsion as a relative invariant of
pseudo-Legendrian knots which are framed-isotopic. Using branched standard
spines to describe vector fields we show how to explicitly invert Turaev's
reconstruction map from combinatorial to smooth Euler structures, thus making
the computation of torsions a more effective one. As an example we work out a
specific calculation.

  Phys.Rev.Lett",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  We introduce a method to estimate the initial conditions of a mutivariable
dynamical system from a scalar signal. The method is based on a modified
multidimensional Newton-Raphson method which includes the time evolution of the
system. The method can estimate initial conditions of periodic and chaotic
systems and the required length of scalar signal is very small. Also, the
method works even when the conditional Lyapunov exponent is positive. An
important application of our method is that synchronization of two chaotic
signals using a scalar signal becomes trivial and instantaneous.

to estimate unknown parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from a given
scalar chaotic time series. We present an important extension of the method
when time series of a scalar function of the variables of the underlying
dynamical system is given. We find that it is possible to obtain
synchronization as well as parameter estimation using such a time series. We
then consider a general quadratic flow in three dimensions and discuss
applicability of our method of parameter estimation in this case. In practical
situations one expects only a finite time series of a system variable to be
known. We show that the finite time series can be repeatedly used to estimate
unknown parameters with an accuracy which improves and then saturates to a
constant value with repeated use of the time series. Finally we propose that
the method can be used to confirm the correctness of a trial function modeling
an external unknown perturbation to a known system. We show that our method
produces exact synchronization with the given time series only when the trial
function has a form identical to that of the perturbation.

circulation patterns and that geomagnetic field variations are precursors to
climate change . The exact mechanism for the observed close relationship
between global geomagnetic field and the tropospheric weather patterns is not
clear. In this paper a universal theory of atmospheric eddy dynamics is
presented which shows that the global geomagnetic field, atmospheric electric
field and weather systems are manifestations of a semi permanent scale
invariant hierarchical atmospheric eddy continuum. Quantitative equations are
derived to show that the full continuum of atmospheric eddies exist as a
unified whole and originate from buoyant energy supply from frictional
turbulence at the planetary surface . Large eddy growth occurs from turbulence
scale by the universal period doubling route to chaos . The turbulent eddies
are carried upwards on the large eddy envelopes and vertical mixing occurs by
the turbulent eddy fluctuations resulting in downward transport of negative
space charges from higher levels and simultaneous upward transport of positive
space charges from surface levels. The eddy circulations therefore generate a
large-scale vertical aerosol current, which is of the correct sign and
magnitude to generate the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field.
Therefore, atmospheric circulation patterns leave signature on the geomagnetic
field lines whose global variations can be easily monitored by satellite borne
sensors and thus assist in weather and climate prediction.

suppose that good particle detectors are somehow fooled in the context of the
surreal trajectories experiments. Rather than showing that Bohm's theory
predicts the wrong particle trajectories or that it somehow prevents one from
making reliable measurements, such experiments ultimately reveal the special
role played by position and the fundamental incompatibility between Bohm's
theory and relativity.

requires the free energy kT ln 2. We argue that the reliability of the bit
erasure process is bounded by the accuracy inherent in the statistical state of
the energy source (`the resources') driving the process. We develop a general
framework describing the `thermodynamic worth' of the resources with respect to
reliable bit erasure or good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the
distinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in the
sense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly, Kullback-Leibler
relative information is a decisive quantity for the `worth' of the resource's
state. Due to the asymmetry of relative information, the reliability of the
erasure process is bounded rather by the relative information of the
equilibrium state wit respect to the actual state than by the relative
information of the actual state with respect to the equilibrium state (which is
the free energy up to constants).

in classical phase space and for the Wigner functions of its quantum
counterpart, we discuss a notion of Lyapunov exponent for quantum dynamics.
Because the marginal distributions, obtained by the tomography map, are always
well defined probabilities, the correspondence between classical and quantum
notions is very clear. Then we also obtain the corresponding expressions in
Hilbert space. Some examples are worked out. Classical and quantum exponents
are seen to coincide for local and non-local time-dependent quadratic
potentials. For non-quadratic potentials classical and quantum exponents are
different and some insight is obtained on the taming effect of quantum
mechanics on classical chaos. A detailed analysis is made for the standard map.
Providing an unambiguous extension of the notion of Lyapunov exponent to
quantum mechnics, the method that is developed is also computationally
efficient in obtaining analytical results for the Lyapunov exponent, both
classical and quantum.
