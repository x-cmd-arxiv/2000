extended radio regions and lobes is of the same order of that produced by
accretion and illuminating the emission line clouds. Most of the radiative
power is produced in a well localized region of the jet, and, at least during
flares, is mainly emitted in the gamma-ray band. A possible scenario
qualitatively accounting for these facts is the internal shock model, in which
the central engine produces a relativistic plasma flow in an intermittent way.

appeal, describing the aspects of the magnetospheric fuelling:storage:release
cycle which are generic to slowly-driven, interaction-dominated, thresholded
systems rather than unique to the magnetosphere. In consequence, several recent
numerical ""sandpile"" algorithms have been used with a view to comparison with
magnetospheric observables. However, demonstration of SOC in the magnetosphere
will require further work in the definition of a set of observable properties
which are the unique ""fingerprint"" of SOC. This is because, for example, a
scale-free power spectrum admits several possible explanations other than SOC.
  A more subtle problem is important for both simulations and data analysis
when dealing with multiscale and hence broadband phenomena such as SOC. This is
that finite length systems such as the magnetosphere or magnetotail will by
definition give information over a small range of orders of magnitude, and so
scaling will tend to be narrowband. Here we develop a simple framework in which
previous descriptions of magnetospheric dynamics can be described and
contrasted. We then review existing observations which are indicative of SOC,
and ask if they are sufficient to demonstrate it unambiguously, and if not,

representation of the least-action method that uses a redshift-space dataset to
simultaneously constrain the real-space fields $\delta$,$\b v$. This method is
robust in recovering the entire evolution of the matter density contrast and
peculiar velocities of galaxies in real space from current galaxy redshift
surveys. The main strength of the method is that it permits us to break the
degeneracy of the parameters $b$ and $\Omegam$ (customarily measured in the
ratio $\beta\equiv \Omegam^{0.6}/b$ from redshift-space distortions), and these
are evaluated in the current context separately. The procedure provides a
simple numerical means to extract as much information as possible from a given
sample, in the simplest linear bias model, before resorting to cosmic
complementarity to resolve the degeneracy in the measurement of $\Omegam$. The
same premise applies to more sophisticated choices of bias models. We construct
a likelihood parameter $\lambda(b,\Omegam)$ to evaluate the relative likelihood
of different values of $b$ and $\Omegam$. The method is applied to the \iras
redshift survey with a low-resolution Gaussian smoothing length of 1200 \km
within a spherical region $x_{\rm max} \sim 15,000$ \km and the reconstructed
velocity field is then compared with POTENT-reconstructed velocities from the
Mark III radial-velocity dataset within a radius $\sim 5000$ \km, which have
been suitably prepared to account for Malmquist bias and other systematic
errors. The analysis yields a likelihood for the parameters that is overall
consistent with $\Omegam\approx 0.3$ and $b\approx 1.1$, thus lending support
to a non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx 0.7$ in a

dominated by a dark matter halo. We follow the dynamical and chemical evolution
of the ISM by means of an improved 2-D hydrodynamical code coupled with
detailed chemical yields originating from type II SNe, type Ia SNe and single
low and intermediate mass stars (IMS). In particular we follow the evolution of
the abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Mg, Si and Fe. We find that for a galaxy
resembling IZw18, a galactic wind develops as a consequence of the starburst
and it carries out of the galaxy mostly the metal-enriched gas. In addition, we
find that different metals are lost differentially in the sense that the
elements produced by type Ia SNe are more efficiently lost than others. As a
consequence of that we predict larger [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for the gas inside
the galaxy than for the gas leaving the galaxy. A comparison of our predicted
abundances of C, N, O and Si in the case of a burst occurring in a primordial
gas shows a very good agreement with the observed abundances in IZw18 as long
as the burst has an age of $\sim 31$ Myr and IMS produce some primary nitrogen.
However, we cannot exclude that a previous burst of star formation had occurred
in IZw18 especially if the preenrichment produced by the older burst was lower
than $Z=0.01$ Z$_{\odot}$. Finally, at variance with previous studies, we find
that most of the metals reside in the cold gas phase already after few Myr.
This result is mainly due to the assumed low SNII heating efficiency, and
justifies the generally adopted homogeneous and instantaneous mixing of gas in
chemical evolution models.

We find that the luminosity function is steeper than a standard Schechter
function at faint magnitudes, and shows an excess of galaxies below M_R ~ -19.
After corrections for light loss and crowding, the data can be described by a
sum of two Schechter functions, one with M_R = -22.8 and alpha = -1.0, and one
steeper with M_R = -18.9 and alpha = -1.5, representing the dwarf population. A
straight-line fit to the faint part yields a slope similar to the Schechter
alpha = -1.5 of the dwarf population. The luminosity function of MS2255.7+2039
is compared to other clusters at lower redshifts, and does not show any
significant difference. The redshift range for clusters in which increased
number of dwarf galaxies have been found is therefore extended to higher
redshifts.

phenomena in High-Tc cuprates.
  The obtained results well explain the experimental results including their
doping dependences.
  In our previous paper (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 68 (1999) 2999.), we have shown
that the pseudogap phenomena observed in High-Tc cuprates are naturally
understood as a precursor of the strong coupling superconductivity. On the
other hand, there is an interpretation for the recent high field NMR
measurements to be an evidence denying the pairing scenarios for the pseudogap.
In this paper, we investigate the magnetic field dependence of NMR $1/T_{1}T$
on the basis of our formalism and show the interpretation to be inappropriate.
  The results indicate that the value of the characteristic magnetic field
$B_{{\rm ch}}$ is remarkably large in case of the strong coupling
superconductivity, especially near the pseudogap onset temperature $T^{*}$.
Therefore, the magnetic field dependences can not be observed and $T^{*}$ does
not vary when the strong pseudogap anomaly is observed. On the other hand,
$B_{{\rm ch}}$ is small in the comparatively weak coupling case and $T^{*}$
varies when the weak pseudogap phenomena are observed.
  These results properly explain the high magnetic field NMR experiments
continuously from under-doped to over-doped cuprates.
  Moreover, we discuss the transport phenomena in the pseudogap phase. The
behaviors of the in-plane resistivity, the Hall coefficient and the c-axis
resistivity in the pseudogap phase are naturally understood by considering the
d-wave pseudogap.

function of magnetic field (H) does not track magnetization (M) in the sense
that M saturates at low fields, while MR varies linearly with H. These
observations suggest that the magnetic layers interestingly do not dominate low
temperature magnetotransport process. Interestingly enough, as the T is
increased, say around 100 K, these magnetic layers dominate MR process as
evidenced by the tracking of M and MR in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$. These results tempts

Wannier functions. Some exact properties of a periodic one-dimensional
condensate are easily demonstrated: (i) the lowest band at positive energy
refers to phase modulations of the condensate and has a linear dispersion
relation near the Brillouin zone centre; (ii) the higher bands arise from the
superposition of localized excitations with definite phase relationships; and
(iii) the wavenumber-dependent current under a constant force in the
semiclassical transport regime vanishes at the zone boundaries. Early results

energy bands are used to specify the conditions under which the Wannier
functions may be approximated by on-site tight-binding orbitals of harmonic-
oscillator form. In this approximation the connections between the low-lying
excitations in a lattice and those in a harmonic well are easily visualized.
Analytic results are obtained in the tight-binding scheme and are illustrated
with simple numerical calculations for the dispersion relation and

detail the structure of the unusual peak recently observed in the relaxation
time in Cu. In particular, we discuss the role of Auger electrons in the
electron dynamics and its dependence on the d-hole lifetime, the optical
transition matrix elements and the laser pulse duration. We find that the Auger
contribution to the distribution is very sensitive to both the d-hole lifetime
tau_h and the laser pulse duration tau_l and can be expressed as a monotonic
function of tau_l/tau_h. We have found that for a given tau_h, the Auger
contribution is significantly smaller for a short pulse duration than for a
longer one. We show that the relaxation time at the peak depends linearly on
the d-hole lifetime, but interestingly not on the amount of Auger electrons
generated. We provide a simple expression for the relaxation time of excited
electrons which shows that its shape can be understood by a phase space
argument and its amplitude is governed by the d-hole lifetime. We also find
that the height of the peak depends on both the ratio of the optical transition

arises and has many applications in computational biology and coding theory.
This problem has two versions: the Closest String problem and the Closest
Substring problem. Assume that we are given a set of strings ${\cal S}=\{s_1,
s_2, ..., s_n\}$ of strings, say, each of length $m$. The Closest String
problem asks for the smallest $d$ and a string $s$ of length $m$ which is
within Hamming distance $d$ to each $s_i\in {\cal S}$. This problem comes from
coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from a given set
of codes. The problem is NP-hard. Berman et al give a polynomial time algorithm
for constant $d$. For super-logarithmic $d$, Ben-Dor et al give an efficient
approximation algorithm using linear program relaxation technique. The best
polynomial time approximation has ratio 4/3 for all $d$ given by Lanctot et al
and Gasieniec et al. The Closest Substring problem looks for a string $t$ which
is within Hamming distance $d$ away from a substring of each $s_i$. This
problem only has a $2- \frac{2}{2|\Sigma|+1}$ approximation algorithm
previously Lanctot et al and is much more elusive than the Closest String
problem, but it has many applications in finding conserved regions, genetic
drug target identification, and genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether
there are efficient approximation algorithms for both problems are major open
questions in this area. We present two polynomial time approxmation algorithms
with approximation ratio $1+ \epsilon$ for any small $\epsilon$ to settle both
questions.

different assumptions made concerning the atoms whose logical values cannot be

we propose to unify and extend this assumption-based approach by introducing
parameterized semantics for logic programs. The parameter holds the value that
one assumes for all atoms whose logical values cannot be inferred from the
rules. We work within multi-valued logic with bilattice structure, and we
consider the class of logic programs defined by Fitting.
  Following Fitting's approach, we define a simple operator that allows us to
compute the parameterized semantics, and to compare and combine semantics
obtained for different values of the parameter. The semantics proposed by
Fitting corresponds to the value false. We also show that our approach captures
and extends the usual semantics of conventional logic programs thereby unifying

theory of free quarks, and quarks interacting with gluons, into a generalized

which asserts that all real-space renormalization group schemes are necessarily
inaccurate, simple Contractor Renormalization group (CORE) computations can
give highly accurate results even if one only keeps a small number of states
per block and a few terms in the cluster expansion. In addition I argue that

that the simplest CORE computation yields a first principles understanding of

conventional approach from one in Ref. 1 [Joyce, Prokopec] and assume that the
Universe reheats by the scalar field decay before the nucleosynthesis epoch,
and find a larger expansion rate at the electroweak scale than the one obtained
in Ref. 1. The decaying field models suffer however from an entropy release
that dilutes the baryon number produced at the electroweak scale. This dilution
is minimized when the kinetic scalar field mode dominates (w_phi = 1), singling
it out as the preferred cosmology with regard to baryogenesis. We study both
cases, the electroweak transition with an expansion driven departure from
equilibrium, and a first order phase transition. We show that in the former
case with some tuning one can produce the amount of matter consistent with
observation. In the latter case the expansion rate at the electroweak scale may
be almost as large as the symmetric phase sphaleron rate, so that even the
electroweak models with a relatively weak first order phase transition can be
viable for baryogenesis.

are allowed. The purpose of this letter is to reanalize the problem including
all the solar neutrino data available, to discuss the dependence on the
statistical criteria in the determination of the CL of the ``dark side'' and to
extract the corresponding limits on the largest mixing allowed by the data. Our
results show that when the Super-Kamiokande data on the zenith angle
distribution of events and the spectrum information is included, the regions
extend more into the dark side.

light Higgs boson spectrum allowed by the (minimal and non-minimal) GMSB
framework. Today's most accurate GMSB model generation and two-loop
Feynman-diagrammatic calculation of m_h have been combined. The Higgs masses
are shown in dependence of various model parameters at the messenger and
electroweak scales. In the minimal model, an upper limit on m_h of about 124
GeV is found for m_t = 175 GeV. The second study is focused on the measurement
of the fundamental SUSY breaking scale sqrt(F) at the LHC in the GMSB scenario
where a stau is the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) and decays into a
gravitino with c*tau_NLSP in the range 0.5 m to 1 km. This implies the
measurement of mass and lifetime of long lived sleptons. The identification is
performed by determining the time of flight in the ATLAS muon chambers.
Accessible range and precision on sqrt(F) achievable with a counting method are
assessed.

experienced by particles in ordinary d-dimensions (one-time) can be described
in the language of two-time physics in a spacetime with d+2 dimensions. This is
obtained by generalizing the worldline formulation of two-time physics by
including background fields. A given two-time model, with a fixed set of
background fields, can be gauged fixed from d+2 dimensions to (d-1) +1
dimensions to produce diverse one-time dynamical models, all of which are
dually related to each other under the underlying gauge symmetry of the unified
two-time theory. To satisfy the gauge symmetry of the two-time theory the
background fields must obey certain coupled differential equations that are
generally covariant and gauge invariant in the target d+2 dimensional
spacetime. The gravitational background obeys a null homothety condition while
the gauge field obeys a differential equation that generalizes a similar
equation derived by Dirac in 1936. Explicit solutions to these coupled
equations show that the usual gravitational, gauge, and other interactions in d
dimensions may be viewed as embedded in the higher d+2 dimensional space, thus
displaying higher spacetime symmetries that otherwise remain hidden.

AdS and discuss their analytic properties. Using methods of conformal partial
wave analysis, we present a general procedure to study conformal four-point
functions in terms of exchanges of scalar and tensor fields. The logarithmic
terms in the four-point functions are connected to the anomalous dimensions of
the exchanged fields. Comparison of the results from AdS graphs with the
conformal partial wave analysis, suggests a possible general form for the
operator product expansion of scalar fields in the boundary CFT.

Calderon-Zygmund operators which are bounded in $L^2$ are bounded from

the colliding ions. In contrast, the directed flow of nucleons vanishes and
even develops antiflow in the midrapidity range in (semi)peripheral collisions

flow is linked to nuclear shadowing. Since the effect is stronger for a light
system, it can be distinguished from the similar phenomenon caused by the
quark-gluon plasma formation. In the latter case the disappearance of the flow
due to the softening of the equation of state should be most pronounced in
collisions of heavy ions. The centrality dependence of the elliptic flow shows
that the maximum in the <v_2(b)> distribution is shifted to very peripheral
events with rising incident energy, in accord with experimental data. This is
an indication of the transition from baryonic to mesonic degrees of freedom in
