particular emphasis on the recent work of morpholgical studies. The weight of
observational evidence shows that proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) are most
certainly axisymmetric like planetary nebulae. Recent work suggests two
subclasses of PPNe optical morphology, DUst-Prominent Longitudinally-EXtended
(DUPLEX) and Star-Obvious Low-level Elongated (SOLE). Radiative transfer models
of an example DUPLEX PPN and SOLE PPN, presented here, support the
interpretation that DUPLEX and SOLE are two physically distinct types of PPNe.
The DUPLEX PPNe and SOLE PPNe may well be the precursors to bipolar and
elliptical PNe, respectively.

Broad, blueshifted absorption arising in the nebula is seen in C IV 1550,
reaching about 2500 km/s. This can be interpreted as evidence for a fast outer
shell, and we adopt a spherically symmetric model to constrain the properties
of this. We find that the density appears to decrease outward in the shell. A
lower limit to the mass is 0.3 solar masses with an accompanying kinetic energy
of 1.5EE{49} ergs. A massive 10^{51} erg shell cannot be excluded, but is less
likely if the density profile is much steeper than R^{-4} and the velocity is
<6000 km/s. The observations cover the region 1140-1720 A. With the time-tag
mode of the spectrograph we obtain the pulse profile. It is similar to that in
the near-UV, although the primary peak is marginally narrower. Together with
the near-UV data, and new optical data from NOT, our spectrum of the pulsar
covers the entire region from 1140-9250 A. Dereddening the spectrum gives a
flat spectrum for E(B-V)=0.52, R=3.1. This dereddened spectrum of the Crab
pulsar can be fitted by a power law with spectral index alpha_{\nu} = 0.11 +/-
0.04. The main uncertainty is the amount and characteristics of the interstel-
lar reddening, and we have investigated the dependence of \alpha_{\nu} on
E(B-V) and R. In the extended emission covered by our 25"" x 0.5"" slit in the
far-UV, we detect C IV 1550 and He II 1640 emission lines from the Crab nebula.
Several interstellar absorption lines are detected toward the pulsar. The Ly
alpha absorption indicates a column density of 3.0+/-0.5\EE{21} cm^{-2} of
neutral hydrogen, which agrees well with our estimate of E(B-V)=0.52 mag. Other
lines show no evidence of severe depletion of metals in atomic gas.

brightness within $\sim$5 arcminutes around NGC 1275 -- the dominant galaxy of
the Perseus cluster. The typical amplitude of the variations is of the order of
30% of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness at a given distance from NGC
1275. We argue that this substructure could be related to the activity of NGC
1275 in the past. Bubbles of relativistic plasma, inflated by jets, be forced
to rise by buoyancy forces, mix with the ambient intracluster medium (ICM), and
then spread. Overall evolution of the bubble may resemble the evolution of a
hot bubble during a powerful atmospheric explosion. From a comparison of the
time scale of the bubble inflation to the rise time of the bubbles and from the
observed size of the radio lobes which displace the thermal gas, the energy
release in the relativistic plasma by the active nucleus of NGC 1275 can be
inferred. Approximate modeling implies a nuclear power output of the order of
$10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ averaged over the last $\sim 3~10^7$ years. This is
comparable with the energy radiated in X-rays during the same epoch. Detailed
measurements of the morphology of the X-ray structure, the temperature and
abundance distributions with Chandra and XMM may test this hypothesis.

B 62, 6241 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevB.62.6241",,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Elastic systems driven in a disordered medium exhibit a depinning transition
at zero temperature and a creep regime at finite temperature and slow drive
$f$. We derive functional renormalization group equations which allow to
describe in details the properties of the slowly moving states in both cases.
Since they hold at finite velocity $v$, they allow to remedy some shortcomings
of the previous approaches to zero temperature depinning. In particular, they
enable us to derive the depinning law directly from the equation of motion,
with no artificial prescription or additional physical assumptions. Our
approach provides a controlled framework to establish under which conditions
the depinning regime is universal. It explicitly demonstrates that the random
potential seen by a moving extended system evolves at large scale to a random
field and yields a self-contained picture for the size of the avalanches
associated with the deterministic motion. At $T>0$ we find that the effective
barriers grow with lenghtscale as the energy differences between neighboring
metastable states, and demonstrate the resulting activated creep law $v\sim
\exp (-C f^{-\mu}/T)$ where the exponent $\mu$ is obtained in a $\epsilon=4-D$
expansion ($D$ is the internal dimension of the interface). Our approach also
provides quantitatively a new scenario for creep motion as it allows to
identify several intermediate lengthscales. In particular, we unveil a novel
``depinning-like'' regime at scales larger than the activation scale, with
avalanches spreading from the thermal nucleus scale up to the much larger
correlation length $R_{V}$. We predict that $R_{V}\sim T^{-\sigma}f^{-\lambda
}$ diverges at small $f$ and $T$ with exponents $\sigma ,\lambda$ that we
determine.

surface of macroion such multivalent counterions form a strongly correlated
liquid, with the short range order resembling that of a Wigner crystal. These
correlations create additional binding of multivalent counterions to the
macroion surface with binding energy larger than $k_BT$. As a result even for a
moderate concentration of multivalent counterions in the solution, their total
charge at the surface of macroion exceeds the bare macroion charge in absolute
value. Therefore, the net charge of the macroion inverts its sign. In the
presence of a high concentration of monovalent salt the absolute value of
inverted charge can be larger than the bare one. This giant inversion of charge
can be observed by electrophoresis or by direct counting of multivalent
counterions.

between domain-walls ($L_s$) induces an effective quark mass ($m_{\rm eff}$)
which complicates the chiral limit. In this work, we study the size of the
effective mass as the function of $L_s$ and the domain-wall height $m_0$ by
calculating the smallest eigenvalue of the hermitian domain-wall Dirac operator
in the topologically-nontrivial background fields. We find that, just like in
the free case, $m_{\rm eff}$ decreases exponentially in $L_s$ with a rate
depending on $m_0$. However, quantum fluctuations amplify the wall effects
significantly. Our numerical result is consistent with a previous study of the
effective mass from the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation.

hyperbolic neighborhoods. The problem is local, and therefore we can consider
the case when our surface is ${\bf R^4}$ with an arbitrary almost-complex
structure $J$ of class $C^{1.\alpha}$. Let $C$ be a non-singular $J$-complex
curve passing through the origin. Our result cah be stated as follows: There
exists a basis $\{U_j\}$ of neighborhoods of zero in ${\bf R^4}$, such that
$(U_j,J)$ are complete hyperbolic in the sence of Kobayashi, moreover
$(U_j\setminus C,J)$ are complete hyperbolic as well.
  The fact that this result remains true for any almost-complex structure is
somewhat suprising. Really, given any germ of a non-singular real surface $C\ni
0$ in ${\bf R^4}$, one can easily construct an almost-complex structure $J$ in
a neighborhood of zero, such that $C$ becomes a $J$-complex curve.
  Typical corollary is the following:
  Let ${\cal M}_{\omega, 5l}$ be the Banach manifold consisting of pairs
$(J,\{D_j\}_{j=1}^5)$, where $J$ is any almost-complex structure on ${\bf
CP^2}$ tamed by the Fubini-Studi form $\omega$ and $\{D_j\}_{j=1}^5$ the union

  (eps) to be presented at Annual APS March Meeting 2000, session K25, 9 AM
  Wednesday",,"10.1121/1.1362685",,"nlin.CD",,"  Several acoustic experiments show a surprising degree of stability in wave
fronts propagating over multi-megameter ranges through the ocean's sound
channel despite the presence of random-like, sound speed fluctuations. Previous
works have pointed out the existence of chaos in simplified ray models
incorporating structure inspired by the true ocean environment. A
``predictability horizon'' has been introduced beyond which stable wave fronts
cease to exist and point-wise, detailed comparisons between even the most
sophisticated models and experiment may be limited for fundamental reasons. We
find, by applying one of the simplified models, that for finite ranges, the
fluctuations of the ray stabilities are very broad and consistent with
lognormal densities. A fraction of the rays retain a much more stable character
than the typical ray. This may be one of several possible mechanisms leading to
greater than anticipated sound field stability. The lognormal ray stability
density may underlie the recent, experimentally determined, lognormal density
of wave field intensities [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 105 (1999) 3202--18].

scale considerations and elementary particle Compton wavelength scale
considerations, particularly in the context of Wheeler's space time foam and a
space time arising out of a stochastic random heap of elementary particles
discussed in previous papers. These parallels lead to a semi qualitative
picture which shows how the short lived Planck scale arises from the Compton
wavelength considerations.

Ni$^{25+}$($1s^2 2s$) ions were measured at high-energy resolution at the
Heidelberg heavy-ion storage ring TSR. We studied the center-of-mass energy
range 0--130 eV which covers all $\Delta n$=0 core excitations. The influence
of external crossed electric (0--300 V/cm) and magnetic (41.8--80.1 mT) fields
was investigated. For the measurement at near-zero electric field resonance
energies and strengths are given for Rydberg levels up to n$=$32; also
Maxwellian plasma rate coefficients for the $\Delta n$=0 DR at electron
temperatures between 0.5 and 200 eV are provided. For increasing electric field
strength we find that for both the $2p_{1/2}$ and the $2p_{3/2}$ series of
Ni$^{24+}$($1s^2 2p_j n\ell$) Rydberg resonances with n>30 the DR rate
coefficient increases approximately linearly by up to a factor of 1.5. The
relative increase due to the applied electric field for Ni$^{25+}$ is
remarkably lower than that found in previous measurements with lighter
isoelectronic Si$^{11+}$, Cl$^{14+}$ and also Ti$^{19+}$ ions, [T. Bartsch et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 2233 (1997); {\bf 82}, 3779 (1999) and to be
published] and in contrast to the results for lighter ions no clear dependence
of the electric field enhancement on the magnetic field strength is found. The
Maxwellian plasma rate coefficients for $\Delta n$=0 DR of Ni$^{25+}$ are
enhanced by at most 11% in the presence of the strongest experimentally applied
fields.
