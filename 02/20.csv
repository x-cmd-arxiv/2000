in the density profiles of virialized dark haloes is predicted. This prediction
disagrees with the soft inner halo mass distribution inferred from observations
of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and some clusters of galaxies. By
analysing data for some of these objects, we find that the halo central density
is nearly independent of the mass from galactic to galaxy cluster scales with
an average value of around 0.02 M_sun/pc^3. We show that soft cores can be
produced in the CDM haloes by introducing a lower cut-off in the power spectra
of fluctuations and assuming high orbital thermal energies during halo
formation. However, the scale invariance of the halo central density is not
reproduced in these cases. The introduction of self-interaction in the CDM
particles offers the most attractive alternative to the core problem. We
propose gravothermal expansion as a possible mechanism to produce soft cores in
the CDM haloes with self-interacting particles. A global thermodynamical
equilibrium can explain the central density scale invariance. We find a minimum
cross section capable of establishing isothermal cores in agreement with the
observed shallow cores. If \sigma and m_x are the cross section and mass of the
dark matter particle, and v is the halo velocity dispersion, then (\sigma/m_x)

advantages. Using an integral the mathematical instability at early times is
avoided and the boundary conditions of the integral correspond closely with
available data. Here it is shown that such a least-action calculation for a
number of bodies interacting by gravity has a finite number of solutions,
possibly only one. Characteristics of the different possible solutions are
explored. The results are extended to cover the motion of a continuous fluid. A
method to generalize an action to use velocities, instead of positions, in
boundary conditions, is given, which reduces in particular cases to those given
by Giavalisco et al. (1993) and Schmoldt & Saha (1998). The velocity boundary

by gravity affect the hydrodynamic state of the flow? What can be said about
the dark matter that comprises 99.9 % of the mass of the universe according to
most cosmological models? Space telescope measurements show answers to these
questions persist literally frozen as fossils of the primordial turbulence and
nonturbulence that controlled structure formation, contrary to standard
cosmology which relies on the erroneous Jeans 1902 linear-inviscid-acoustic
theory and a variety of associated misconceptions (e. g., cold dark matter).
When effects of viscosity, turbulence, and diffusion are included, vastly
different structure scenarios and a clear explanation for the dark matter
emerge. From Gibson's 1996 theory the baryonic (ordinary) dark matter is
comprised of proto-globular-star-cluster (PGC) clumps of hydrogenous planetoids
termed ``primordial fog particles''(PFPs), observed by Schild 1996 as ``rogue
planets ... likely to be the missing mass'' of a quasar lensing galaxy. The
weakly collisional non-baryonic dark matter diffuses to form outer halos of
galaxies and galaxy clusters.

topological properties. For instance, the straight, passing through points A
and B, is defined as a set of such points R that the area S(A,B,R) of the
triangle ABR vanishes. The triangle area is expressed via metric by means of
the Hero's formula, and the straight appears to be defined only via metric,
i.e. without a reference to (topological) concept of curve. (Usually the
straight is defined as the shortest curve, connecting two points A and B). Such
a construction of geometry is free from constraints (continuity, dimensionality
of space), generated by a use of topology, but not by geometry in itself. At
such a description all information on the geometry properties (such as
uniformity, isotropy, continuity and degeneracy) is contained in metric.
Modifying the metric, one changes the geometry automatically. The Riemannian
geometry is constructed by two different ways: (1) by conventional way on the
basis of metric tensor, (2) as a result of modification of the metric in the
sigma-immanent description of the proper Euclidean geometry. The two obtained
geometries are compared. The convexity problem in geometry and the problem of
collinerity of vectors at distant points are considered. The nonmetric
definition of curve is shown to be a concept of only proper Euclidean geometry.
It is inadequate to any non-Euclidean geometry.
