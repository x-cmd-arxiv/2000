10^9 years, the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by several
orders of magnitude. We show that quasar clustering measurements can
substantially narrow the range of possible lifetimes with the assumption that
luminous quasars reside in the most massive host halos. If quasars are
long-lived, then they are rare phenomena that are highly biased with respect to
the underlying dark matter, while if they are short-lived they reside in more
typical halos that are less strongly clustered. For a given quasar lifetime, we
calculate the minimum host halo mass by matching the observed space density of
quasars, using the Press-Schechter approximation. We use the results of Mo &
White to calculate the clustering of these halos, and hence of the quasars they
contain, as a function of quasar lifetime. A lifetime of t_Q = 4 x 10^7 years,
the e-folding timescale of an Eddington luminosity black hole with accretion
efficiency eps=0.1, corresponds to a quasar correlation length r_0 ~ 10 Mpc/h
in low-density cosmological models at z=2-3; this value is consistent with
current clustering measurements, but these have large uncertainties.
High-precision clustering measurements from the 2dF and Sloan quasar surveys
will test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosity
and host halo mass, and if this assumption holds then they should determine t_Q
to a factor of three or better. An accurate determination of the quasar
lifetime will show whether supermassive black holes acquire most of their mass
during high-luminosity accretion, and it will show whether the black holes in
the nuclei of typical nearby galaxies were once the central engines of
high-luminosity quasars.

since it greatly exceeds the masses of central black holes. We explore here the
proposition that a population of low mass, optically dark stars is created from
the cooled gas. We consider a wide variety of radial distributions for the
interstellar cooling, but only a few are consistent with observed X-ray surface
brightness profiles. In a region of concentrated interstellar cooling, the
X-ray emission can exceed that observed, suggesting the presence of additional
support by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure. In general we find that
the mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to stellar dynamical mass to
light ratios which vary with galactic radius. If the stars formed from cooled
interstellar gas are optically luminous, their influence on the the mass to

the rate that old stars lose mass, which is nearly independent of the initial
mass function of the old stellar population.

observed at redshift $z\sim 3$ are best explained by assuming that they are
associated with the most massive haloes at $z\sim 3$ predicted in hierarchical
models of structure formation. In this paper we study, under the same
assumption, how star formation and chemical enrichment may have proceeded in
the LBG population. A consistent model, in which the amount of cold gas
available for star formation must be regulated, is suggested. It is found that
gas cooling in dark haloes provides a natural regulation process. In this
model, the star formation rate in an LBG host halo is roughly constant over
about 1 Gyr. The predicted star formation rates and effective radii are
consistent with observations. The metallicity of the gas associated with an LBG
is roughly equal to the chemical yield, or about the order of $1 Z_{\odot}$ for
a Salpeter IMF. The contribution to the total metals of LBGs is roughly
consistent with that obtained from the observed cosmic star formation history.
The model predicts a marked radial metallicity gradient in a galaxy, with the
gas in the outer region having much lower metallicity. As a result, the
metallicities for the damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems expected from the
LBG population are low. Since LBG halos are filled with hot gas in this model,
their contributions to the soft X-ray background and to the UV ionization
background are calculated and discussed.

profile. The effective radius of the galaxy, as determined by profile fitting,

the powerful AGN lies at the nucleus of the host galaxy. The peak also

these four parameters, only variations of Bout or Ceff can account for the
color-magnitude relation. A range of outflows results in a metallicity
sequence, whereas a range of star formation efficiencies will yield a mixed age
+ metallicity sequence. The age-metallicity degeneracy complicates the issue of
determining which mechanism contributes the most (i.e. outflows versus
efficiency). However, the determination of the slope of the correlation between
mass-to-light ratio and mass in clusters at moderate or high redshift will
allow us to disentangle age and metallicity.

electrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates are
evaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we compute
within the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are then
obtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full
inclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also
reported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the
band structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller
than those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in
Be, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the
density of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$
electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions
yields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in a
free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$)
electrons.

spatially uniform system of smooth inelastic spheres are performed. In order to
reach a steady state, the particles are assumed to be under the action of an
external driving force which does work to compensate for the collisional loss
of energy. Three different types of external driving are considered: (a) a
stochastic force, (b) a deterministic force proportional to the particle
velocity and (c) a deterministic force parallel to the particle velocity but
constant in magnitude. The Enskog-Boltzmann equation in case (b) is fully
equivalent to that of the homogeneous cooling state (where the thermal velocity
monotonically decreases with time) when expressed in terms of the particle
velocity relative to the thermal velocity. Comparison of the simulation results
for the fourth cumulant and the high energy tail with theoretical predictions
derived in cases (a) and (b) [T. P. C. van Noije and M. H. Ernst, Gran. Matt.

deviation from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not well represented by
Sonine polynomials in case (c), even for low dissipation. In addition, the high

physic, gives a new point of view for the study of singularities of integrable
1-forms. Namely, we will prove that any integrable 1-form which vanishes at a
point and has a non-zero linear part at this point is, up to multiplication by
a non-vanishing function, the formal pull-back of a two dimensional 1-form. We
also obtain a classification of quadratic integrable 1-forms.

  Evolution of Food Web Structure","40 pages, preprint format",,,,"nlin.AO q-bio",,"  We develop a set of equations to describe the population dynamics of many
interacting species in food webs. Predator-prey interactions are non-linear,
and are based on ratio-dependent functional responses. The equations account
for competition for resources between members of the same species, and between
members of different species. Predators divide their total hunting/foraging
effort between the available prey species according to an evolutionarily stable
strategy (ESS). The ESS foraging behaviour does not correspond to the
predictions of optimal foraging theory. We use the population dynamics
equations in simulations of the Webworld model of evolving ecosystems. New
species are added to an existing food web due to speciation events, whilst
species become extinct due to coevolution and competition. We study the
dynamics of species-diversity in Webworld on a macro-evolutionary timescale.
Coevolutionary interactions are strong enough to cause continuous overturn of
species, in contrast to our previous Webworld simulations with simpler
population dynamics. Although there are significant fluctuations in species
diversity because of speciation and extinction, very large scale extinction
avalanches appear to be absent from the dynamics, and we find no evidence for
self-organised criticality.

analytically by means of a formal perturbation expansion which uses weak
coupling and the vicinity to a symmetry breaking bifurcation point. In
parameter space four phases with different ergodic behaviour are observed.
Although the coupling in the map lattice is diffusive, antiferromagnetic
ordering is predominant. Via coarse graining the deterministic model is mapped
to a master equation which establishes an equivalence between our system and a
kinetic Ising model. Such an approach sheds some light on the dependence of the
transient behaviour on the system size and the nature of the phase transitions.

  Biophys. J. (Dec. 1999)",,,"ibr-00-02","physics.bio-ph",,"  The response kinetics of liquid crystalline phosphatidylcholine bilayer
stacks to rapid, IR-laser induced temperature jumps has been studied by
millisecond time-resolved x-ray diffraction. The system reacts on the fast
temperature change by a discrete bilayer compression normal to its surface and
a lateral bilayer expansion. Since water cannot diffuse from the excess phase
into the interbilayer water region within the 2 ms duration of the laser pulse,
the water layer has to follow the bilayer expansion, by an anomalous thinning.
Structural analysis of a 20 ms diffraction pattern from the intermediate phase
indicates that the bilayer thickness remains within the limits of isothermal
equilibrium values. Both, the intermediate structure and its relaxation into
the original equilibrium L_(alpha)-phase, depend on the visco-elastic
properties of the bilayer/water system. We present an analysis of the
relaxation process by an overdamped one-dimensional oscillation model revealing
the concepts of Hooke's law for phospholipid bilayers on a supramolecular
basis. The results yield a constant bilayer repulsion and viscosity within
Hooke's regime suggesting that the hydrocarbon chains act as a buffer for the
supplied thermal energy. The bilayer compression is a function of the initial
temperature and the temperature amplitude, but is independent of the chain
length.

if there is no further major axiom in quantum physics than those formulated for
example in Dirac's `Quantum Mechanics', then a quantum physicist would not be
able to tell a torus from a hole in the ground. We argue that there are indeed
such axioms involving observables with smooth time evolution: they contain
commutative subalgebras from which the spatial slice of spacetime with its
topology (and with further refinements of the axiom, its $C^K-$ and $C^\infty-$
structures) can be reconstructed using Gel'fand - Naimark theory and its
extensions. Classical topology is an attribute of only certain quantum
observables for these axioms, the spatial slice emergent from quantum physics
getting progressively less differentiable with increasingly higher excitations
of energy and eventually altogether ceasing to exist. After formulating these
axioms, we apply them to show the possibility of topology change and to discuss
quantized fuzzy topologies. Fundamental issues concerning the role of time in
quantum physics are also addressed.
