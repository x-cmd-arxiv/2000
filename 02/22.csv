The analysis of the lightcurves indicates that the outbursts do not start in
the outer disc regions. The disc expands during rise to maximum and shrinks
during decline and along the quiescent period. At the end of two outbursts the
system was seen to go through a phase of lower brightness, characterized by an
out-of-eclipse level ~15 per cent lower than the typical quiescent level and by
the fairly symmetric eclipse of a compact source at disc centre with little
evidence of a bright spot at disc rim. New eclipse timings were measured and a
revised ephemeris was derived. The residuals with respect to the linear
ephemeris are well described by a sinusoid of amplitude 1.2 minutes and period
\~4 years and are possibly related to a solar-like magnetic activity cycle in
the secondary star. Eclipse phases of the compact central source and of the
bright spot were used to derive the geometry of the binary. By constraining the
gas stream trajectory to pass through the observed position of the bright spot
we find q=0.72+/-0.06 and i= 85 +3/-2 degrees. The binary parameters were
estimated by combining the measured mass ratio with the assumption that the
secondary star obeys an empirical main sequence mass-radius relation. We find
M_1= 0.75+/-0.15 M_sun and M_2= 0.54+/-0.10 M_sun. The white dwarf at disc
centre is surrounded by an extended and variable atmosphere or boundary layer
of at least 3 times its radius and a temperature of T ~28000 K. The fluxes at
mid-eclipse yield an upper limit to the contribution of the secondary star and
lead to a lower limit photometric parallax distance of D= 290+/-80 pc. The
fluxes of the secondary star are well matched by those of a M0+/-2 main
sequence star.

UMi AP (=alpha UMi Aa) of the Polaris multiple stellar system. The orbit is
based on the spectroscopic orbit of the Cepheid alpha UMi A (orbital period of
AP: 29.59 years), and on the difference Delta mu between the
quasi-instantaneously measured HIPPARCOS proper motion of Polaris and the
long-term-averaged proper motion given by the FK5. There remains an ambiguity
in the inclination i of the orbit, since Delta mu cannot distinguish between a
prograde orbit (i=50.1 deg) and a retrograde one (i=130.2 deg). Available
photographic observations of Polaris favour strongly the retrograde orbit. For
the semi-major axis of the photo-center of AP we find about 29 milliarcsec
(mas). For the component P, we estimate a mass of 1.5 solar masses and a
magnitude difference with respect to the Cepheid of 6.5 mag. The present
separation between A and P should be about 160 mas. We obtain the proper motion
of the center-of-mass of alpha UMi AP with a mean error of about 0.45 mas/year.
Using the derived astrometric orbit, we find the position of the center-of-mass
at the epoch 1991.31 with an accuracy of about 3.0 mas. Our ephemerides for the
orbital correction, required for going from the position of the center-of-mass
to the instantaneous position of the photo-center of AP at an arbitrary epoch,
have a typical uncertainty of 5 mas. For epochs which differ from the HIPPARCOS
epoch by more than a few years, a prediction for the actual position of Polaris
based on our results should be significantly more accurate than using the
HIPPARCOS data in a linear prediction, since the HIPPARCOS proper motion
contains the instantaneous orbital motion of about 4.9 mas/year = 3.1 km/s.
Finally we derive the galactic space motion of Polaris.

in agreement with King (1993), but not with other studies using a lower
Teff-scale for subdwarfs. However we obtain slightly smaller O abundances for
the most luminous metal poor field stars than for fainter stars of similar
metallicities, an effect attributed to inadequacies of the adopted model
atmospheres (Kurucz 1992, with overshooting) for cool stars. We find a nearly
constant O overundance in metal poor stars ([Fe/H]<-0.8), at a mean value of
0.46+-0.02 dex (sigma=0.12, 32 stars), with only a gentle slope with [Fe/H] (~
-0.1); this result is different from the steeper slope recently obtained using
OH band in the near UV. If only 'bonafide' unmixed stars are considered, C
abundances scale with Fe ones (i.e. [C/Fe]~ 0) down to [Fe/H]~ -2.5. Due to our
adoption of a different Teff-scale, we do not confirm the slight C excess in
the most metal poor disk dwarfs (-0.8<[Fe/H]<-0.4) found in previous studies.
Na abundances scale as Fe ones in the high metallicity regime, while metal-poor
stars present a Na underabundance. None of the field stars analyzed belong to
the group of O-poor and Na-rich stars observed in globular clusters. Na is
deficient with respect to Mg in halo and thick disk stars; within these

Wilson--Polyakov renormalization group. In addition to the standard parameters
which define the non-linear $\sigma$-model, namely the conductance and the
external frequency, a new parameter enters, which may be related to the
fluctuations of the staggered density of states. We find that, when both the
regular hopping and the disorder only couple one sublattice to the other, the
quantum corrections to the Kubo conductivity vanish at the band center, thus
implying the existence of delocalized states. In two dimensions, the RG
equations predict that the conductance flows to a finite value, while both the
density of states and the staggered density of states fluctuations diverge. In
three dimensions, we find that, for arbitrarily weak disorder, sufficiently
close to the band center, all states are extended. We also discuss the role of

system. This refocusing originates a Polarization Echo whose amplitude
attenuates by increasing the time $t_R$ elapsed until the dynamics is reversed.
Different functional attenuations are found for a set of dipolar coupled
systems: ferrocene, (C$_5$H$_5$)$_2$Fe, cymantrene, (C$_5$H$_5$)Mn(CO)$_3$, and
cobaltocene, (C$_5$H$_5$)$_2$Co. To control a relevant variable involved in
this attenuation a pulse sequence has been devised to progressively reduce the
dipolar dynamics. Since it reduces the evolution of the polarization echo it is
referred as REPE sequence. Two extreme behaviors were found while
characterizing the materials: In systems with a strong source of relaxation and
slow dynamics, the attenuation follows an exponential law (cymantrene). In
systems with a strong dipolar dynamics the attenuation is mainly Gaussian. By
the application of the REPE sequence the characteristic time of the Gaussian
decay is increased until the presence of an underlying dissipative mechanism is
revealed (cobaltocene). For ferrocene, however, the attenuation remains
Gaussian within the experimental time scale. These two behaviors suggest that
the many body quantum dynamics presents an extreme intrinsic instability which,
in the presence of small perturbations, leads to the onset of irreversibility.
This experimental conclusion is consistent with the tendencies displayed by the
numerical solutions of model systems.

consequences.
  The paper should be accessible to topologists, category theorists, and anyone
acquainted with operads. After a review of operads and monoidal categories, the
definition of homotopy algebra is given. Specifically, suppose that M is a
monoidal category in which it makes sense to talk about algebras for some
operad P. Then our definition says what a homotopy P-algebra in M is, provided
only that some of the morphisms in M have been marked out as `homotopy
equivalences'.
  The bulk of the paper consists of examples of homotopy algebras. We show that
any loop space is a homotopy monoid, and, in fact, that any n-fold loop space
is an n-fold homotopy monoid in an appropriate sense. We try to compare
weakened algebraic structures such as A_infinity-spaces, A_infinity-algebras
and non-strict monoidal categories to our homotopy algebras, with varying
degrees of success. We also prove results on `change of base', e.g. that the
classifying space of a homotopy monoidal category is a homotopy topological
monoid. Finally, we reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of our
definition, and on how the definition really ought to be replaced by a more
subtle infinity-categorical version.

Fundamental objects of study are ""minimal extension sheaves"" on ""fan spaces"".
These are flabby sheaves of graded modules over a sheaf of polynomial rings,
satisfying three relatively simple axioms that characterize the properties of
the equivariant intersection cohomology sheaf on a toric variety, endowed with
the finite topology given by open invariant subsets. These sheaves are models
for the ""pure"" objects of a ""perverse category""; a ""Decomposition Theorem"" is
shown to hold. -- Formalizing those fans that define ""equivariantly formal""
toric varieties (where equivariant and non-equivariant intersection cohomology
determine each other by Kunneth type formulae), we study ""quasi-convex"" fans
(including fans with convex or with ""co-convex"" support). For these, there is a
meaningful ""virtual intersection cohomology"". We characterize quasi-convex fans
by a topological condition on the support of their boundary fan and prove a
generalization of Stanley's ""Local-Global"" formula realizing the intersection
Poincare polynomial of a complete toric variety in terms of local data. Virtual
intersection cohomology of quasi-convex fans is shown to satify Poincare
duality. To describe the local data in terms of virtual intersection cohomology
of lower-dimensional complete polytopal fans, one needs a ""Hard Lefschetz"" type
theorem. It requires a vanishing condition that is known to hold for rational
cones, but yet remains to be proven in the general case.

and the orbit closures for unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups,
are extended for actions of subgroups generated by unipotent elements. More
precisely: Let G be a Lie group (not necessarily connected) and Gamma a closed
subgroup of G. Let W be a subgroup of G such that Ad(W) is contained in the
Zariski closure (in the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra of G) of the
subgroup generated by the unipotent elements of Ad(W). Then any finite ergodic
invariant measure for the action of W on G/Gamma is a homogeneous measure
(i.e., it is supported on a closed orbit of a subgroup preserving the measure).
Moreover, if G/Gamma has finite volume (i.e., has a finite G-invariant
measure), then the closure of any orbit of W on G/Gamma is a homogeneous set
(i.e., a finite volume closed orbit of a subgroup containing W). Both the above
results hold if W is replaced by any subgroup Lambda of W such that W/Lambda
has finite volume.
