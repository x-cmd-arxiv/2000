halos initially contain kinematically cold, dense 1/r-power-law cores. For
interaction cross sections (sigma/mp) >= 10-100 cm**2/g weak self-interaction
leads to the formation of isothermal, constant density cores within a Hubble
time as a result of heat transfer into the cold inner regions. This core
structure is in good agreement with the observations of dark matter rotation
curves in dwarf galaxies. The isothermal core radii and core densities are a
function of the halo scale radii and scale masses which depend on the
cosmological model. Adopting the currently popular LCDM model, the predicted
core radii and core densities are on good agreement with the observations. For
large interaction cross sections, massive dark halos with scale radii rs >=
14000 cm**2/g/(sigma/mp) kpc could experience core collapse during their
lifetime, leading to cores with singular isothermal density profiles.

  Debris Disks","109 pages, 45 figures","Ph.D. Thesis, University of Florida, December 1999",,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent advances in astronomical instrumentation mean that we are now able to
image the thermal emission from the disks of dust around main sequence stars
that may be the fossil remnants of planetary formation. These observations
imply that the distribution of dust in the debris disks is neither smooth nor
symmetrical; e.g., mid-infrared images of the disk of dust around the young A0V
star HR 4796A show two lobes of emission, one of which may be ~5% brighter than
the other. The observed structure of the debris disk in the solar system, i.e.,
the zodiacal cloud, also contains asymmetries: it has an offset center of
symmetry, it is warped, and there is an asymmetric ring of dust co-orbiting
with the Earth. Since the zodiacal cloud's asymmetries have been shown to be
signatures of the gravitational perturbations of the solar system's planets, it
is hoped that it may be possible to indirectly detect extrasolar planetary
systems by their signatures in debris disk observations. This dissertation uses
the physical processes that affect the evolution of debris material in the
solar system to create a generalized model for the evolution of circumstellar
debris material. It then shows how planetary perturbations affect that
evolution, thereby causing the signatures of planets seen in the structure of
the zodiacal cloud. This model can be used to provide a quantitative
interpretation of debris disk observations, and the necessary modeling
techniques are demonstrated by their application to observations of the HR 4796
disk. As well as determining the large scale structure of the HR 4796 disk, the
modeling shows how a small body (>10 Earth mass) in the HR 4796 system that is
on an orbit with an eccentricity larger than 0.02 could be the cause of the
observed brightness asymmetry.

remnants (SNRs) is extended to study the cosmic ray (CR) and associated high
energy gamma-ray production during SN shock propagation through the
inhomogeneous circumstellar medium of a progenitor star that emits a strong
wind. The wind forms a low-density bubble surrounded by a swept-up shell of
interstellar matter. Gamma rays are produced as a result of decay of pions
which in turn are the result of collisions of CRs with nuclei of the thermal
plasma. The time evolution of the SNRs is followed numerically, taking into
account the nonlinear backreaction of the accelerated CRs. Examples typical for
SN type Ib and SN type II explosions are considered. Apart from the
confirmation of the known fact that acceleration is extremely rapid and that
the upper momentum cutoff is reached almost immediately after the explosion due
to the high wind magnetic field, it is also shown that the CRs are accelerated
with high efficiency. The CR energy spectrum, ultimately produced in the SNRs,
has a power law form with index = 2.0 to 2.1 in a wide energy range up to a
maximum energy which is about 10^14 eV if the CR diffusion coefficient is as
small as the Bohm limiting value. However, the expected pi^0-decay gamma-ray
flux is considerably lower than in the case of a uniform interstellar medium; a
relatively high gamma-ray luminosity in the TeV band, detectable at distances
of several kpc, is only expected in the case of a relatively dense ISM with a
number density above 10/cc.

an extension of the normal-mode formalism developed by Ipser & Lindblom for

material and the diffuse interstellar medium along the lines of sight toward
Sagittarius A* and the Quintuplet sources, GCS3 and GCS4. It is evident from
the depth of the 3.0 micron H2O and the 4.27 micron CO2 ice features that there
is more molecular cloud material along the line of sight toward Sgr A* than
GCS3 and 4. In fact, Sgr A* has a rich infrared ice spectrum with evidence for
the presence of solid CH4, NH3, and possibly HCOOH.
  Hydrocarbon dust in the diffuse interstellar medium along the line of sight
to the GC is characterized by absorption features centered at 3.4, 6.85, and

aliphatic hydrocarbons, and ISO has given us the first meaningful observations
of the corresponding modes at longer wavelengths. The integrated strengths of
these three features suggest that hydrogenated amorphous carbon is their
carrier. We attribute an absorption feature centered at 3.28 micron in the GCS3
spectrum to the C-H stretch in aromatic hydrocarbons. This feature is not
detected, and its C-C stretch counterpart appears to be weaker, in the SgrA*

mergers of compact objects and the explosions of massive stars. These two cases
have distinctive environments for GRBs: compact object mergers occur in the
interstellar medium (ISM) and the explosions of massive stars occur in the
preburst stellar wind. We here discuss neutrino afterglows from reverse shocks
as a result of the interaction of relativistic fireballs with their surrounding
wind matter. After comparing with the analytical result of Waxman & Bahcall
(2000) for the homogeneous ISM case, we find that the differential spectrum of
neutrinos with energy from $\sim 3\times 10^{15}$ to $\sim 3\times 10^{17}$ eV
in the wind case is softer by one power of the energy than in the ISM case.
Furthermore, the expected flux of upward moving muons produced by neutrino
interactions below a detector on the surface of the Earth in the wind case is
$\sim 5$ events per year per km$^2$, which is about one order of magnitude
larger than in the ISM case. In addition, these properties are independent of
whether the fireballs are isotropic or beamed. Therefore, neutrino afterglows,
if detected, may provide a way of distinguishing between GRB progenitor models
based on the differential spectra of neutrinos and their event rates in a
detector.

this are superclusters and voids and also by redshift taking discrete values.
In this paper it is proposed that discrete redshift can be explained by using
the spherical harmonic integer l; this occurs both in the metric or density
perturbations and also in the solution of wave equations in Robertson-Walker
spacetime. It is argued that the near conservation of energy implies that l
varies regularly for wave equations in Robertson-Walker spacetime, whereas for
density perturbations l cannot vary regularly. Once this is assumed then
perhaps the observed value of discrete redshift provides the only observational
or experimental data that directly requires an explanation using both
gravitational and quantum theory. In principle a model using this data could
predict the scale factor R (or equivalently the deceleration parameter q).
Solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in Robertson-Walker spacetimes are used
to devise models which have redshift taking discrete values, but they predict a
microscopic value for R. A model in which the stress of the Klein-Gordon
equation induces a metrical perturbation of Robertson-Walker spacetime is
devised. Calculations based upon this model predict that the Universe is closed
with $2q_0-1=10^{-4}$.

mathematically rigororous methods and a powerful Ansatz. The method exploited
is general, and can be applied to others disordered mean field models such as,
e.g., neural networks.
  It is well known that the probability measure of overlaps among replicas
carries the whole physical content of these models. A functional order
parameter of Parisi type is introduced by rigorous methods, according to
previous works by F. Guerra. By the Ansatz that the functional order parameter
is the correct order parameter of the model, we explicitly find the full
overlap distribution. The physical interpretation of the functional order
parameter is obtained, and ultrametricity of overlaps is derived as a natural
consequence of a branching diffusion process.
  It is shown by explicit construction that ultrametricity of the 3-replicas
overlap distribution together with the Ghirlanda-Guerra relations determines
the distribution of overlaps among s replicas, for any s, in terms of the
one-overlap distribution.

Hamiltonian treatment of black holes. It has been applied successfully to the
cases of {\it non-rotating}, {\it non-distorted} black holes in Einstein
Vacuum, Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories. In this note,
it is investigated the extent to which the framework can be generalized to the
case of non-Abelian gauge theories where `hairy black holes' are known to
exist. It is found that this extension is indeed possible, despite the fact
that in general, there is no `canonical normalization' yielding a preferred
Horizon Mass. In particular the zeroth and first laws are established for all
normalizations. Colored static spherically symmetric black hole solutions to
the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations are considered from this perspective. A
canonical formula for the Horizon Mass of such black holes is found. This
analysis is used to obtain nontrivial relations between the masses of the
colored black holes and the regular solitonic solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills
theory. A general testing bed for the instability of hairy black holes in
general non-linear theories is suggested. As an example, the embedded Abelian
magnetic solutions are considered. It is shown that, within this framework, the
total energy is also positive and thus, the solutions are potentially unstable.
Finally, it is discussed which elements would be needed to place the Isolated
Horizons framework for Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in the same footing as the
previously analyzed cases. Motivated by these considerations and using the fact
that the Isolated Horizons framework seems to be the appropriate language to
state uniqueness and completeness conjectures for the EYM equations --in terms
of the horizon charges--, two such conjectures are put forward.

a lattice and a plausible scaling region for the target chiral gauge theory in
the continuum limit. Following the previous analysis of massive and massless
fermion spectra in the scaling region, we compute the coupling vertices between
gauge field and fermions by the strong multifermion coupling expansion and
analytical continuation of these vertex functions in the energy-momentum space.
We show a peculiar scenario that a massless fermion is SU_L(2)-chirally gauged
in the low energy and 15 non-degenerate massive Dirac fermions are
SU_L(2)-vectorially gauged at the lattice scale O(1/a). The Ward identities
associated to the chiral gauge symmetry are realized by both the massless
chiral fermion and massive Dirac fermions. These Ward identities protect the
perturbative calculations in the small gauge coupling from hard gauge-symmetry
breakings and lead to the normal gauge-invariant renormalization prescription.
The vacuum functional is perturbatively computed by a continuum regularization
scheme in 16 edges of Brillouin zones. We achieve the correct form of the gauge
anomaly and U_L(1) fermion-flavour singlet anomaly with the soft chiral
symmetry breaking scale that is much smaller than the lattice scale. The
residual breakings of chiral gauge symmetry after the gauge anomaly
cancellation are eliminated in the normal gauge-invarinant renormalization
prescription. We discuss the consistency of the scenario and the reasons for it
to work for perturbative and non-perturbative gauge field.

consider a candidate theory for the dynamical stabilization, through the
introduction of a massless scalar field in the bulk, which interacts with the
branes. We find exact static solutions for the metric and scalar field in the
bulk and demonstrate that the inter-brane distance is determined by the
parameters of scalar field-brane interactions. However, these solutions are
always accompanied by a correlation between the bulk cosmological constant, the
brane self-energies and the interaction terms of the scalar field with the
branes and thus cannot be considered as candidates for the phenomenologically
viable stabilized geometry. We find that the aforementioned correlation cannot
be avoided even in the case of a single-brane solution with positive
self-energy where the fifth dimension ends on a singularity.

the construction of relevant classical solutions in supergravity. We discuss
the gauge theory and the conformal field theory relevant to D-brane description
of these systems. In order to discuss Hawking radiation we are automatically
led to a discussion of near-horizon geometries and their relation to gauge
theories and conformal field theories. We show how inputs from AdS/CFT
correspondence resolve some earlier puzzles regarding Hawking radiation.
Besides the D1/D5 system, we include a brief discussion of some
nonsupersymmetric systems which show unexpected agreement between supergravity
and perturbative brane/string computations. We also comment briefly on possible
implications of the AdS/CFT relation for the correspondence principle and for
the principle of black hole complementarity.

superalgebra residing on the world sheet, we construct explicitly the Virasoro
generators and the N supercurrents. N is even. The resulting superconformal
algebra has an affine SL(N/2) \otimes U(1) current algebra as an internal
subalgebra. Though we do not complete the general superalgebra, we outline the
underlying construction and present supporting evidence for its validity.
Particular attention is paid to its BRST invariance. In the classical limit
where the free field realization may be substituted by a differential operator
realization, we discuss further classes of generators needed in the closure of
the algebra. We find sets of half-integer spin fields, and for N>4 these
include generators of negative weights. An interesting property of the
construction is that for N>2 it treats the supercurrents in an asymmetric way.
Thus, we are witnessing a new class of superconformal algebras not obtainable
by conventional Hamiltonian reduction. The complete classical algebra is
provided in the case N=4 and is of a new and asymmetric form.

correct Newton's law can be obtained by exchanging bulk gravitons. This can be
interpreted as an exchange of a single {\it metastable} 4D graviton. Such
theories have remarkable phenomenological signatures since the evolution of the
Universe becomes high-dimensional at very large scales. Furthermore, the bulk
supersymmetry in the infinite volume limit might be preserved while being
completely broken on a brane. This gives rise to a possibility of controlling
the value of the bulk cosmological constant. Unfortunately, these theories have
difficulties in reproducing certain predictions of Einstein's theory related to
relativistic sources. This is due to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity
in the propagator of a massive graviton. This suggests that all theories in

gauge-invariant but B-dependent correction terms involving metric in the field
redefinition which have not been considered before. With the problem resolved,
we establish a systematic method under the alpha' expansion to derive the

hole spacetimes. The effective quantum spacetime felt by a point-like test mass
is constructed by ``renormalization group improving'' the Schwarzschild metric.
The key ingredient is the running Newton constant which is obtained from the
exact evolution equation for the effective average action. The conformal
structure of the quantum spacetime depends on its ADM-mass M and it is similar
to that of the classical Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. For M larger than,
equal to, and smaller than a certain critical mass $M_{\rm cr}$ the spacetime
has two, one and no horizon(s), respectively. Its Hawking temperature, specific
heat capacity and entropy are computed as a function of M. It is argued that
the black hole evaporation stops when M approaches $M_{\rm cr}$ which is of the
order of the Planck mass. In this manner a ``cold'' soliton-like remnant with
the near-horizon geometry of $AdS_2\times S^2$ is formed. As a consequence of
the quantum effects, the classical singularity at r=0 is either removed
completely or it is at least much milder than classically; in the first case
the quantum spacetime has a smooth de Sitter core which would be in accord with
the cosmic censorship hypothesis even if $M<M_{\rm cr}$.

order n (pseudo-PDE if n is odd) with an exponential nonlinearity. When n=2,
this PDE is known in statistical mechanics as Poisson-Boltzmann equation, with
applications to point vortices, 2D Coulomb and magnetized plasmas and
gravitational systems. It is then also known in conformal differential
geometry, where it is the central equation in Nirenberg's problem of prescribed
Gaussian curvature. For constant Gauss curvature it becomes Liouville's
equation, which also appears in two-dimensional so-called quantum Liouville
gravity. The PDE for n=4 is Paneitz' equation, and while it is not known in
statistical mechanics, it originated from a study of the conformal invariance
of Maxwell's electromagnetism and has made its appearance in some recent model
of four-dimensional quantum gravity. In differential geometry, the Paneitz

  textual modifications to original version. 53 pages, 10 tables, 9 figures,
  http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ddw/",,,"formerly math.SC/0002189","math.NA",,"  Boundary integral methods for the solution of boundary value PDEs are an
alternative to `interior' methods, such as finite difference and finite element
methods. They are attractive on domains with corners, particularly when the
solution has singularities at these corners. In these cases, interior methods
can become excessively expensive, as they require a finely discretised 2D mesh
in the vicinity of corners, whilst boundary integral methods typically require
a mesh discretised in only one dimension, that of arc length.
  Consider the Dirichlet problem. Traditional boundary integral methods applied
to problems with corner singularities involve a (real) boundary integral
equation with a kernel containing a logarithmic singularity. This is both
tedious to code and computationally inefficient. The CBIEM is different in that
it involves a complex boundary integral equation with a smooth kernel. The
boundary integral equation is approximated using a collocation technique, and
the interior solution is then approximated using a discretisation of Cauchy's
integral formula, combined with singularity subtraction.
  A high order quadrature rule is required for the solution of the integral
equation. Typical corner singularities are of square root type, and a
`geometrically graded h-p' composite quadrature rule is used. This yields
efficient, high order solution of the integral equation, and thence the
Dirichlet problem.
  Implementation and experimental results in \textsc{matlab} code are
presented.

boson, representing quark and diquark constituents of the nucleon, form a bound
state owing to a contact interaction. Photon and pion couplings to the quark
provide vertex functions for the photon and pion interactions with the
composite nucleon. By a suitable choice of cutoff parameters of the model,
realistic electromagnetic form factors are obtained. When a pseudoscalar
pion-quark coupling is used, the pion-nucleon coupling is predominantly
pseudovector. A virtual photopion amplitude is considered in which there are
two types of contributions: hadronic contributions where the photon and pion
interactions have an intervening propagator of the nucleon or its excited
states, and contact-like contributions where the photon and pion interactions
occur within a single vertex. At large Q, the contact-like contributions are
dominant. The model nucleon exhibits scaling behavior in deep-inelastic
scattering and the normalization of the parton distribution provides a rough
normalization of the contact-like contributions. Calculations for the virtual
photopion amplitude are performed using kinematics appropriate to its
occurrence as a meson-exchange current in electron-deuteron scattering. The
results show that the contact-like terms can dominate the meson-exchange
current for Q > 1 GeV/c. There is a direct connection of the contact-like terms
to the off-forward parton distributions of the model nucleon.

with negative initial slope are used in this series as basic functions, while
their amplitudes are chosen by the condition that the distribution of energy
over exponential intervals of wavenumbers is the same as for the continuous

an exact analytical solution for the velocity field. We also notice that such
