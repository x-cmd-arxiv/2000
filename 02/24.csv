this paper we use the submm data from the SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey

submm-radio spectral index on various galaxy properties and find that there is
no significant trend with dust temperature or 850 micron luminosity. The ratio
of 850 micron/1.4 GHz flux was found to decrease with increasing radio and FIR
luminosity, and we propose that this is due to a component of the dust not
associated with recent star formation but which is instead heated to 15-20 K by
the general interstellar radiation field.

acceleration, to a projected angular distance of 1.7 arcsec in most cases,
followed by deceleration that approaches the systemic velocity at a projected

this model, the emitting material is evacuated along the bicone axis, and the
axis is inclined 5 degrees out of the plane of the sky. The acceleration of the

field. The radiation force is due to spectral lines and is calculated using a
generalized multidimensional formulation of the Sobolev approximation. The
effects of the magnetic field are approximated by adding a force that emulates
a magnetocentrifugal force. Our approach allows us to calculate disk winds when
the magnetic field controls the flow geometry, forces the flow to corotate with
the disk, or both. In particular, we calculate models where the lines of the
poloidal component of the field are straight and inclined to the disk at a
fixed angle. Our numerical calculations show that flows which corotate with the
disk have a larger mass loss rate than their counterparts which conserve
specific angular momentum. The difference in the mass loss rate between these
two types of winds can be several orders of magnitude for low disk luminosities
but vanishes for high disk luminosities. Winds which corotate with the disk
have much higher velocities than angular momentum conserving winds. Fixing the
wind geometry stabilizes winds which are unsteady when the geometry is derived
self-consistently. The inclination angle between the poloidal velocity and the
normal to the disk midplane is important. Non-zero inclination angles allow the
magnetocentrifugal force to increase the mass loss rate for low luminosities,
and increase the wind velocity for all luminosities. Our calculations also show
that the radiation force can launch winds from magnetized disks. The line force
can be essential in producing MHD winds from disks where the thermal energy is
too low to launch winds or where the field lines make an angle of < 30^o with
respect to the normal to the disk.

are believed to be the scaled-down version of clusters of galaxies, a
similarity breaking in the fundamental laws may occur on the group scale,
reflecting a transition between galaxy-dominated and intracluster medium
dominated properties. In this paper, we present an extensive study of the
relations between the X-ray luminosity (Lx), the temperature (T) of hot diffuse
gas and the velocity dispersion (sigma) of galaxies for groups and clusters of
galaxies, based on the largest sample of 66 groups and 274 clusters drawn from
literature. Our best fit Lx-T and Lx-sigma relations for groups read Lx propto
T^(5.57+-1.79) propto sigma^(2.35+-0.21), which deviates remarkably from those
for clusters: Lx propto T^(2.79+-0.08) propto sigma^(5.30+-0.21). The
significance of these correlations have been justified by both the
co-consistency test and the Kendall's tau statistics. We have thus confirmed
the existence of similarity breaking in the Lx-T and Lx-sigma relations between
groups and clusters as claimed in previous work, although the best fit sigma-T
relations remain roughly the same in both systems: sigma propto T^0.64.
Alternatively, the significant disagreement between the observationally fitted
Lx-T and Lx-sigma relations for groups and those expected from a perfect
hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis indicates that the X-ray emission of
individual galaxies and the non-gravitational heating must play a potentially
important role in the dynamical evolution of groups. Therefore, reasonable
caution should be exercised in the cosmological applications of the dynamical
properties of groups.

semi-analytic models, focusing on whether the models can reproduce the
kinematic properties of low-ionization metal lines described by Prochaska &
Wolfe (1997b, 1998). We explore a variety of approaches for modelling the
radial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in our
models, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. If we
use an approach based on Fall & Efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of the
discs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that the
majority of the DLAS correspond to a single galactic disc. These models
generically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. In
alternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, a
significant fraction of DLAS arise from lines of sight intersecting multiple
gas discs in a common halo. These models produce kinematics that fit the
observational data, and also seem to agree well with the results of recent
hydrodynamical simulations. Thus we conclude that Cold Dark Matter based models
of galaxy formation can be reconciled with the kinematic data, but only at the
expense of the standard assumption that DLAS are produced by rotationally
supported gas discs whose sizes are determined by conservation of angular
momentum. We suggest that the distribution of cold gas at high redshift may be
dominated by another process, such as tidal streaming due to mergers.

(1975) is modified and applied to spark-associated pulsar emission at radio

prevailing above pulsar polar cap, highly non-stationary spark discharges do
not occur at random positions. Instead, sparks should tend to operate in well
determined preferred regions. At any instant the polar cap is populated as
densely as possible with a number of two-dimensional sparks with a
characteristic dimension as well as a typical distance between adjacent sparks
being about the polar gap height. Our model differs, however, markedly from its

driven by pair production process and anchored to the local pole of a
sunspot-like surface magnetic field. This fixed spark prevents the motion of
other sparks towards the pole, restricting it to slow circumferential drift
across the planes of field lines converging at the local pole. We argue that
the polar spark constitutes the core pulsar emission, and that the annular
rings of drifting sparks contribute to conal components of the pulsar beam. We

explained in the current scenario of galaxy formation without invoking subtle
assumptions, provided that galactic-sized dark haloes have shallow, core-like
central profiles, with a core radius proportional to halo circular velocity. In
such a system, both disk and halo contribute significantly to the maximum
rotation of the disk, and the interaction between the disk and halo components
acts to reduce the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. With model parameters
chosen in plausible ranges, the model can well accommodate the zero-point,
slope, scatter of the observed Tully-Fisher relation, as well as the large
range of disk sizes. The model predicts that LSB disks obey a Tully-Fisher
relation similar to that of normal disks, if disk mass-to-light ratio is
properly taken into account. The halo profile required by the Tully-Fisher
relation is as shallow as that required by the rotation curves of faint disks,
but much shallower than that predicted by conventional CDM models. Our results
cannot be explained by some of the recent proposals for resolving the conflict
between conventional CDM models and the rotation-curve shapes of faint
galaxies. If dark matter self-interaction (either scattering or annihilation)

properties of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAS) in the context of semi-analytic
models. In these models, hierarchical structure formation is approximated by
constructing a merger tree for each dark matter halo. A natural consequence is
that every virialized halo may contain not only a central galaxy, but also a
number of satellite galaxies as determined by its merging history. Thus the
kinematics of the DLAS arise from the combined effects of the internal rotation
of gas disks and the motions between gas disks within a common halo. Here we
investigate the sensitivity of this model to some of the assumptions made
previously, including the modeling of satellite dynamics, the scale height of
the gas, and the cosmology.

calculation of the escape fraction, we find that the hydrogen in the IGM will
be reionized at redshift z=6.1 if the IGM has uniform density, but only by
z=4.5 if the IGM is clumped. We combine our model with an N-body simulation of
the distribution of dark matter in the universe in order to calculate the
secondary temperature anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background

secondary anisotropies covering a broad range of angular scales, with
fractional temperature fluctuations $\sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ on arcminute scales.
The amplitude depends somewhat on the geometry of reionization, with models in
which the regions of highest gas density are reionized first giving larger CMB
fluctuations than the case where galaxies ionize surrounding spherical regions,
and models where low density regions reionize first giving the smallest
fluctuations. Measurement of these anisotropies can therefore put important
constraints on the reionization process, in particular, the redshift evolution
of the filling factor, and should be a primary objective of a next generation

based on the non-stationary sparking model of Ruderman & Sutherland (1975),
modified by Gil & Sendyk (2000) in the accompanying Paper I. According to these
authors, the polar cap is populated as densely as possible by a number of
sparks with a characteristic perpendicular dimension D approximately equal to
the polar gap height scale h, separated from each other also by about h. Each
spark reappears in approximately the same place on the polar cap for a time
scale much longer than its life-time and delivers to the open magnetosphere a
sequence of electron-positron clouds which flow orderly along a flux tube of
dipolar magnetic field lines. The overlapping of particles with different
momenta from consecutive clouds leads to effective two-stream instability,
which triggers electrostatic Langmuir waves at the altitudes of about 50
stellar radii. The electrostatic oscillations are modulationally unstable and
their nonlinear evolution results in formation of ``bunch-like'' charged
solitons. A characteristic soliton length along magnetic field lines is about
30 cm, so they are capable of emitting coherent curvature radiation at radio
wavelengths. The net soliton charge is about 10^21 fundamental charges,
contained within a volume of about 10^14 cm^3. For a typical pulsar, there are
about 10^5 solitons associated with each of about 25 sparks operating on the
polar cap at any instant. One soliton moving relativisticaly along dipolar
field lines with a Lorentz factor of the order of 100 generates a power of
about 10^21 erg/s by means of curvature radiation. Then the total power of a
typical radio pulsar can be estimated as being about 10^(27-28) erg/s.

field-free conditions, as well as under the influence of an external magnetic
field. Using as paradigms impurity-doped (as well as the limiting case of

is shown that the interplay between the interelectron repulsion and the
electronic zero-point kinetic energy leads, for a broad range of impurity

reminiscent of the molecular picture of doubly-excited helium. Comparative
analysis of the conditional probability distributions for the sS-UHF and the
exact solutions for the ground state of two interacting electrons in a clean
parabolic quantum dot reveals that both of them describe formation of an
electron molecule with similar characteristics. The self-consistent field
associated with the triplet excited state of the two-electron quantum dot
(clean as well as impurity-doped) exhibits symmetry breaking of the Jahn-Teller
type, similar to that underlying formation of nonspherical open-shell nuclei
and metal clusters. Furthermore, impurity and/or magnetic-field effects can be
used to achieve controlled manipulation of the formation and pinning of the

Maxwell's equations with the rate equations of electronic population in a

field pattern and the spectra of localized lasing modes inside the system. A
critical pumping rate $P_{r}^{c}$ exists for the appearance of the lasing
peaks. The number of lasing modes increase with the pumping rate and the length
of the system. There is a lasing mode repulsion. This property leads to a
saturation of the number of modes for a given size system and a relation

violation can be as large as one percent, leading to significant probability

  Crawford",,"10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00102-0",,"nlin.PS",,"  Recent experiments (Kudrolli, Pier and Gollub, 1998) on two-frequency
parametrically excited surface waves exhibit an intriguing ""superlattice"" wave
pattern near a codimension-two bifurcation point where both subharmonic and
harmonic waves onset simultaneously, but with different spatial wavenumbers.
The superlattice pattern is synchronous with the forcing, spatially periodic on
a large hexagonal lattice, and exhibits small-scale triangular structure.
Similar patterns have been shown to exist as primary solution branches of a
generic 12-dimensional $D_6\dot{+}T^2$-equivariant bifurcation problem, and may
be stable if the nonlinear coefficients of the bifurcation problem satisfy
certain inequalities (Silber and Proctor, 1998). Here we use the spatial and
temporal symmetries of the problem to argue that weakly damped harmonic waves
may be critical to understanding the stabilization of this pattern in the
Faraday system. We illustrate this mechanism by considering the equations
developed by Zhang and Vinals (1997, J. Fluid Mech. 336) for small amplitude,
weakly damped surface waves on a semi-infinite fluid layer. We compute the
relevant nonlinear coefficients in the bifurcation equations describing the
onset of patterns for excitation frequency ratios of 2/3 and 6/7. For the 2/3
case, we show that there is a fundamental difference in the pattern selection
problems for subharmonic and harmonic instabilities near the codimension-two
point. Also, we find that the 6/7 case is significantly different from the 2/3

evolution by collapsing the atomic state into a pure state which evolves
stochastically. A robust unraveling is one that gives pure states that, on
average, are relatively unaffected by the master equation evolution (which
applies once the monitoring ceases). The ensemble of pure states arising from
the maximally robust unraveling has been suggested to be the most natural way
of representing the system [H.M. Wiseman and J.A. Vaccaro, Phys. Lett. A {\bf
250}, 241 (1998)]. We find that the maximally robust unraveling of a resonantly
driven atom requires an adaptive interferometric measurement proposed by
Wiseman and Toombes [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 2474 (1999)]. The resultant
ensemble consists of just two pure states which, in the high driving limit, are
close to the eigenstates of the driving Hamiltonian $\Omega\sigma_{x}/2$. This
ensemble is the closest thing to a classical limit for a strongly driven atom.
We also find that it is possible to reasonably approximate this ensemble using
just homodyne detection, an example of a continuous Markovian unraveling. This
has implications for other systems, for which it may be necessary in practice
to consider only continuous Markovian unravelings.

Instead of a classical adversary that runs the algorithm with one input and
then modifies the input, we use a quantum adversary that runs the algorithm
with a superposition of inputs. If the algorithm works correctly, its state
becomes entangled with the superposition over inputs. We bound the number of
queries needed to achieve a sufficient entanglement and this implies a lower
bound on the number of queries for the computation.
  Using this method, we prove two new $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ lower bounds on
computing AND of ORs and inverting a permutation and also provide more uniform
proofs for several known lower bounds which have been previously proven via
variety of different techniques.
