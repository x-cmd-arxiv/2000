the distribution of their apparent shapes. We measure the projected cluster
ellipticities using two alternative methods. The first method is based on
moments of the discrete galaxy distribution while the second is based on
moments of the smoothed galaxy distribution. We study the performance of both
methods using Monte Carlo cluster simulations covering the range of APM cluster
distances and including a random distribution of background galaxies. We find
that the first method suffers from severe systematic biases, whereas the second
is more reliable. After excluding clusters dominated by substructure and
quantifying the systematic biases in our estimated shape parameters, we recover
a corrected distribution of projected ellipticities. We use the non-parametric
kernel method to estimate the smooth apparent ellipticity distribution, and
numerically invert a set of integral equations to recover the corresponding
distribution of intrinsic ellipticities under the assumption that the clusters
are either oblate or prolate spheroids. The prolate spheroidal model fits the
APM cluster data best.

the Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIGs, L_IR > 10^11 L_sun) observed in the 2-10
keV energy band (new and archival data). We find that a significant fraction of
the sources optically classified as AGNs do not show any indication of nuclear
activity in the X rays, thus suggesting heavy absorption along our line of
sight. The absence of strong emission in the 20-200 keV band in a subsample of
LIGs observed with BeppoSAX suggests that in many cases these sources are
completely Compton thick (N_H > 10^25 cm^(-2)). From a comparison between the
infrared and the X-ray emission we deduce that the mid-IR emission is absorbed
by a lower column density than the X-ray emission or, alternatively, that the
dust-to-gas ratio is lower than Galactic. We describe a simple model that
reproduces the IR-X correlation by means of mixed AGN and starburst
contributions and we compare the predictions of this model with the
observational data at X-ray and optical wavelengths. Finally, we discuss the
biases that affect the currently available samples of LIGs and briefly analyze
a small unbiased sample, finding that at least 50% of the sources host a (weak)
AGN.

redder than that of the FBQS sample as a whole. The frequency of BAL quasars in

line scattering of X-ray background (XRB) photons by He and H-like ions of
heavy elements can exceed the ``local'' thermal emission by a factor of a few
or more. Due to the conservative nature of scattering this resonantly scattered
radiation can only be identified if a significant fraction of the XRB is
resolved and removed. While the combined spectrum of the resolved sources will
contain X-ray absorption features, the residual background will contain
corresponding emission features with the same intensity. At the relevant
densities and temperatures the lines of He and H-like oxygen at 0.57 and 0.65
keV are most promising. These lines (which have a typical width of $\sim$ 1-2
eV) may contain up to 50% of the total 0.5-1 keV emission of the filament. For
a nearby ($z \la 0.1$) filament with a Thomson optical depth of $10^{-4}$ XMM
should detect about 200 photons in the OVII line during a $10^5$ s exposure if
the metallicity of the gas is as large as observed in galaxy clusters. On
average up to a few percent of the soft XRB could be resonantly scattered by
this phase of the IGM and resonantly scattered photons should account for a
significant fraction of the truly diffuse background at low energies. Close to
bright X-ray sources like galaxy clusters or AGN the flux of scattered
radiation will be further enhanced. Off-line blazars are the most promising
illuminating sources. The scattered emission from AGN may also constrain the
duration of the active phase of these objects.

provide a useful criterion for experimental searches. We also discuss Berry

measured in our $7\mu{\rm m}$ thick crystal, magnetic resonance imaging of

that has become a paradigm of quantum chaos: the stadium billiard. Linear waves
in bounded geometries for which classical ray trajectories are chaotic are
known to give rise to scarred patterns. Here, we utilize parametrically forced
surface waves (Faraday waves), which become progressively nonlinear beyond the
wave instability threshold, to investigate the subtle interplay between
boundaries and nonlinearity. Only a subset (three main types) of the computed
linear modes of the stadium are observed in a systematic scan. These correspond
to modes in which the wave amplitudes are strongly enhanced along paths
corresponding to certain periodic ray orbits. Many other modes are found to be
suppressed, in general agreement with a prediction by Agam and Altshuler based
on boundary dissipation and the Lyapunov exponent of the associated orbit.
Spatially asymmetric or disordered (but time-independent) patterns are also
found even near onset. As the driving acceleration is increased, the
time-independent scarred patterns persist, but in some cases transitions
between modes are noted. The onset of spatiotemporal chaos at higher forcing
amplitude often involves a nonperiodic oscillation between spatially ordered
and disordered states. We characterize this phenomenon using the concept of
pattern entropy. The rate of change of the patterns is found to be reduced as
the state passes temporarily near the ordered configurations of lower entropy.
We also report complex but highly symmetric (time-independent) patterns far
above onset in the regime that is normally chaotic.

correction in this model increases by at least two percent the overall factor
by which the one-photon exchange (Rosenbluth) cross section must be multiplied.
The contribution of soft photon emission is calculated exactly. Comparison is
made with the generally used expressions previously obtained by Mo and Tsai.
Results are presented for some kinematics at high momentum transfer.

of heavy nuclei are reviewed. The motivation for this is the desire to find
wave functions, expressed in terms of the plus-momentum variable, that simplify
the analyses of high energy experiments such as deep inelastic scattering,
Drell-Yan production, (e,e') and (p,p').Some examples of ordinary quantum
mechanics are solved to show that the formalism is tractable. Light-front
quantization is reviewed briefly and applied to: infinite nuclear matter within
the mean field approximation; a simple static source theory; finite nuclei
using the mean field approximation; low-energy pion-nucleon scattering using a
chiral Lagrangian; nucleon-nucleon scattering, within the one boson exchange
approximation; and, infinite nuclear matter including the effects of
two-nucleon correlations. Standard good results for nuclear saturation
properties are obtained, with a possible improvement in the computed nuclear
compressibility. Manifest rotational invariance is not used as an aid in doing
calculations, but it does emerge in the results. It seems that nuclear physics
can be done in a manner in which modern nuclear dynamics is respected, boost
invariance in the $z$-direction is preserved, and in which rotational
invariance is maintained. A salient feature is that $\omega,\sigma$ and $\pi$
mesons are important constituents of nuclei. It seems possible to find
Lagrangians that yield reasonable descriptions of nuclear deep inelastic
scattering and Drell-Yan reactions. Furthermore, the presence of the $\sigma$
and $\omega$ mesons could provide a nuclear enhancement of the ratio of the
cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons in
accord with recent measurements by the HERMES collaboration.

separate two cavities. We suggest a nonlocal test for the field prepared in the
two cavities. We couple classical driving fields with the cavities where a
nonlocal state is prepared. Two independent two-level atoms are then sent
through respective cavities to interact off-resonantly with the cavity fields.
The atomic states are measured after the interaction. Bell's inequality can be
tested by the joint probabilities of two-level atoms being in their excited or
ground states. We find that quantum nonlocality can also be tested using a
single atom sequentially interacting with the two cavities. Potential
experimental errors are also considered. We show that with the present
experimental condition of 5% error in the atomic velocity distribution, the
violation of Bell's inequality can be measured.

  Biocomputing","LaTeX, 5 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.62.7532",,"quant-ph physics.bio-ph q-bio",,"  Quantum search algorithms are considered in the context of protein sequence
comparison in biocomputing. Given a sample protein sequence of length m (i.e m
residues), the problem considered is to find an optimal match in a large
database containing N residues. Initially, Grover's quantum search algorithm is
applied to a simple illustrative case - namely where the database forms a
complete set of states over the 2^m basis states of a m qubit register, and
thus is known to contain the exact sequence of interest. This example
demonstrates explicitly the typical O(sqrt{N}) speedup on the classical O(N)
requirements. An algorithm is then presented for the (more realistic) case
where the database may contain repeat sequences, and may not necessarily
contain an exact match to the sample sequence. In terms of minimizing the
Hamming distance between the sample sequence and the database subsequences the
algorithm finds an optimal alignment, in O(sqrt{N}) steps, by employing an
extension of Grover's algorithm, due to Boyer, Brassard, Hoyer and Tapp for the
case when the number of matches is not a priori known.
