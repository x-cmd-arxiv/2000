James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We find the distribution of the [CI] emission to
be asymmetric with respect to the CO J=1--0 emission, with the peak of the [CI]
emission offset towards the direction of the center of the HII region. In
addition, the line ratio I_{[CI]}/I_{CO} is highest (~ 0.2) facing the HII
region and lowest (< 0.1) away from it. These asymmetries indicate an edge-on
morphology where the [CI] emission is strongest on the side of the cloud facing
the center of the HII region, and not detected at all on the opposite side This
suggests that the sources of the incident flux creating C from the dissociation
of CO are the massive stars of the HII region. The lowest line ratios are
similar to what is observed in Galactic molecular clouds, while the highest are
similar to starburst galaxies and other regions of intense star formation. The
column density ratio, N(C)/N(H_2) is a few times 10^{-6}, in general agreement
with models of photodissociation regions.

by the global Galactic rotation; their distances remain mostly unknown, and
their true nature and origin are still a mystery. Some of them could be of
galactic origin, or belong to tidal streams drawn by the Milky-Way/ Magellanic
Clouds interaction, or could even be intergalactic clouds infalling onto the
Local Group. In the latter hypothesis, they play a major role in the
hierarchical formation scenario of the Milky-Way and are connected to the
Lyman-limit absorption systems. In any case, the determination of their
physical state (density, temperature, internal structure, abundances,
excitation) will help to discriminate between current theories on their origin
and nature. A recent UV measurement (Richter et al 1999) has discovered for the
first time in a HVC the molecular phase that was previously searched for,
without success, through CO emission. Previous non detections could be due
either to metallicity problems, or insufficient excitation (because of low
density). Low-excitation molecular gas may, however, be detectable though
absorption. Here we report on a sensitive search for HCO+(1-0) absorption lines
in front of 27 quasars, already known to be strong millimetric continuum
sources. Except for one tentative case, no detection was obtained in most HVCs,
although HCO+(1-0) was clearly detected towards galactic low-velocity clouds.
We discuss the implications of this result.

effective temperature, surface gravity and specially on the He abundance. We
find that only HeI lines and HeII 4686 are sensibly affected by
microturbulence, and that models with lower gravities, the ones suitable for
supergiants, are more sensitive to it. We analyze five stars using
microturbulence velocities of 0 and 15 km/s. The parameters obtained for 15
km/s differ from the ones at 0 km/s within the limits of the standard error box
of our analysis. The quality of the line fits only improves for HeI 4471, but
not to the extent of completely solving the so-called dilution effect.
Therefore our conclusion is that microturbulence is affecting the derivation of
stellar parameters, but its effect is comparable to the adopted uncertainties.
Thus it can reduce moderate He overabundances and solve line fit quality
differences, but it cannot explain by itself large He overabundances in O
stars.

measurements alone [Phys. Rev. B 59, 11767 (1999)]. At the least, the films

enhance lepton flavor violating processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, from

either the WZNW action for G_0 or the gauged WZNW action for a coset of the

topological inflation. However, these always yield singular black holes and
never have the shell passing through the aymptotically flat region. Although
the regular black hole spacetimes satisfy the strong energy condition, they
avoid the singularity theorems by failing to satisfy the genericity condition

understanding of the genetic code is incomplete and a system-level genetic code
in which seemingly independent proteins are encoded in an interdependent,
highly correlated manner exists. The methods by which human beings design and
fabricate complex systems of tightly coadapted parts are explored for insights
into the requirements for a system-level genetic code. Detailed examples of
system-level codes for networks of matching parts are presented. The
implications of identifying and deciphering the system-level genetic code if it
exists for the prevention, treatment, and cure of heart disease, cancer, immune
disorders, and for rational drug design are discussed.

atomic nuclei is solved using the canonical representation in the coordinate
space for zero range interactions like the Skyrme force. The gradient method is
improved for faster convergence to the solutions under constraint of
orthogonality between canonical orbitals. Necessity of the cut-off of the
pairing interaction is shown even when the number of the canonical orbitals are
restricted. A repulsive dependence of the interaction on the pairing density is
introduced as an implementation of the cut-off which leaves the HFB super
matrix state-independent.

is examined concerning the precision of the density tail. Small cutoff energies
are shown to give rise to ripples in the tail, whose wave length corresponds to
the cutoff momentum. More precise solutions require higher cutoff energies,
which result in HFB matrices of larger dimensions. To circumvent the difficulty
of the large dimension, we employ another method to solve the HFB ---the
natural-orbital method introduced originally for spherical nuclei--- to apply
it to deformed nuclei. The method can be successfully implemented with a
three-dimensional Cartesian mesh representation.

polarized mode of the quantized electromagnetic field with an isolated two-
level atom is generalized to the case of atomic levels degenerate in the
projections of the angular momenta on the quantization axis, which is a usual
case in the experiments. This generalization, like the original model, obtains
the explicit solution. The model is applied to calculate the dependence of the
atomic level populations on the angle between the polarization of cavity field
mode and that of the laser excitation pulse in the experiment with one-atom
micromaser.

result is the quantum continuous variable analog of Grover's algorithm

(i.e., Fourier transform) operation is used in conjunction with inversion about
the average of quantum states to allow the approximate identification of an
unknown quantum state in a way that gives a square-root speed-up over search
algorithms using classical continuous variables. Also, we show that this
quantum search algorithm is robust for a generalised Fourier transformation on
continuous variables.
