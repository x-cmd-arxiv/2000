equivalent width than for the normal elliptical population in the field or

cluster ellipticals, 0.337 nm for ellipticals from a variety of other clusters,
and 0.422 nm for field ellipticals. We interpret this homogeneity as being due
to a greater age, or more uniform history, of star formation in BCGs than in
other ellipticals; only a small fraction of the scatter can be due to
metallicity variations, even in the BCGs. Notwithstanding the small scatter,
correlations are found between CO strength and various galaxy properties,
including R-band absolute magnitude, which could improve the precision of these
galaxies as distance indicators in measurements of cosmological parameters and

are obtained. The galaxies are selected to be ellipticals (no lenticulars),
with a large spatial distribution, covering both the core and outskirt of the
cluster (ie. corresponding to regions with large density contrasts).
Spectroscopic CO (2.3 micron) absorption indices, measuring contribution from
intermediate-age red giant and supergiant stars to the near-IR light of the
ellipticals, are then estimated.
  It is found that the strength of spectroscopic CO features in elliptical
galaxies increases from the core (r < 0.2 deg) to the outskirts (r > 0.2 deg)
of the Coma cluster. Using the Mg2 strengths, it is shown that the observed
effect is not due to metallicity and is mostly caused by the presence of a
younger population (giant and supergiant stars) in ellipticals in outskirts
(low density region) of the cluster.
  Using the spectroscopic CO features, the origin of the scatter on the near-IR
Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies is studied. Correcting this relation
for contributions from the red giant and supergiant stars, the rms scatter
reduces from 0.077dex to 0.073dex. Although measurable, the contribution from
these intermediate-age stars to the scatter on the near-IR Fundamental Plane of
ellipticals is only marginal.
  A relation is found between the CO and V-K colours of ellipticals with a
slope 0.036 +/- 0.016. This is studied using stellar synthesis models.

Euclidean transformations (AET), which are equivalent to Euclidean
transformations at space-time infinity, and proposes a formulation of
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which is invariant under such
transformations. This formulation is based on the asymptotic quantum measure,
which is shown to be invariant under AET's. This invariance exposes an
important connection between AET's and Feynman path integrals, and reveals the
nonmetric character of the asymptotic quantum measure. The latter feature
becomes even clearer when the theory is formulated in terms of the
coordinate-free formalism of asymptotically Euclidean manifold, which do not
have a metric structure. This mathematical formalism suggests the following
physical interpretation: (i) Particles evolution is represented by trajectories
on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold; (ii) The metric and the law of motion
are not defined a priori as fundamental entities, but they are properties of a
particular class of reference frames; (iii) The universe is considered as a
probability space in which the asymptotic quantum measure plays the role of a
probability measure. Points (ii) and (iii) are used to build the asymptotic
measurement theory, which is shown to be consistent with traditional quantum
measurement theory. The most remarkable feature of this measurement theory is
the possibility of having a nonchaotic distribution of the initial conditions
(NCDIC), an extremely counterintuitive but not paradoxical phenomenon which
allows to interpret typical quantum phenomena, such as particle diffraction and
tunnel effect, while still providing a description of their motion in terms of
classical trajectories.
