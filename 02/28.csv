between galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes.
This detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure was
made using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin^2 obtained at
the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) with the UH8K and CFH12K panoramic
CCD cameras. The amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2\pm 0.2 % at 1
arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effect
induced by large-scale structure.We provide a quantitative analysis of
systematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effect
is small and can be corrected for. We show that the measured ellipticity
correlations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. The
relatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmological
models. However the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmological
models, and marginally reject Cold Dark Matter models with (Omega=0.3,
sigma_8<0.6) or (Omega=1, sigma_8=1). The detection of cosmic shear
demonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measure
dark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parameter
measurements, in particular with upcoming wide field CCD cameras.

and Dielectric Breakdown Models) combine complex geometry with randomness; this
double difficulty is a stumbling block to their elucidation. In this paper we
introduce a wide class of fractal growth models with highly complex geometry
but without any randomness in their growth rules. The models are defined in
terms of deterministic itineraries of iterated conformal maps, automatically
generating the global conformal function which maps the exterior of the unit
circle to the exterior of a n-particle growing aggregate. The complexity of the
evolving interfaces is fully contained in the deterministic dynamics of the
conformal map. We focus attention to a class of growth models in which the
itinerary is quasiperiodic. Such itineraries can be approached via a series of
rational approximants. The analytic power gained is used to introduce a scaling
theory of the fractal growth patterns. We explain the mechanism for the
fractality of the clusters and identify the exponent that determines the
fractal dimension.

it be easily extended to handle some strictly sequential operators such as cuts

top-down evaluation of the well-founded semantics. SLT-resolution is a
substantial extension of SLDNF-resolution with tabling. Its main features
include: (1) It resolves infinite loops and redundant computations while
preserving the linearity. (2) It is terminating, and sound and complete w.r.t.
the well-founded semantics for programs with the bounded-term-size property
with non-floundering queries. Its time complexity is comparable with
SLG-resolution and polynomial for function-free logic programs. (3) Because of
its linearity for query evaluation, SLT-resolution bridges the gap between the
well-founded semantics and standard Prolog implementation techniques. It can be
implemented by an extension to any existing Prolog abstract machines such as
WAM or ATOAM.

in this model is flatter than \phi^2, we have found that fluctuations develop
and go non-linear to form non-topological solitons, Q-balls. The size of a
Q-ball is determined by the most amplified mode, which is completely determined
by the model parameters. On the other hand, the charge of Q-balls depends
linearly on the initial charge density of the Affleck-Dine (AD) field. Almost
all the charges are absorbed into Q-balls, and only a tiny fraction of the
charges is carried by a relic AD field. It may lead to some constraints on the
baryogenesis and/or parameters in the particle theory. The peculiarity of
gravity-mediation is the moving Q-balls. This results in collisions between
Q-balls. It may increase the charge of Q-balls, and change its fate.

superparticles provide a natural explanation for the flavor and CP problems in
the supersymmetric standard model (SUSY SM). However, the heavy sfermions may
drive the mass squareds for the light third generation sfermions to be negative
through two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations, breaking color and
charge. Introducing extra matters to the SUSY SM, it is possible to construct
models where the sfermion masses are RG invariant at the two-loop level in the
limit of vanishing gaugino-mass and Yukawa-coupling contributions. We calculate
the finite corrections to the light sfermion masses at the two-loop level in
the models. We find that the finite corrections to the light-squark mass
squareds are negative and can be less than (0.3-1)% of the heavy-squark mass
squareds, depending on the number and the parameters of the extra matters. We
also discuss whether such models realized by the U(1)_X gauge interaction at
the GUT scale can satisfy the constraints from \Delta m_K and \epsilon_K
naturally. When both the left- and right-handed down-type squarks of the
first-two generations have common U(1)_X charges, the supersymmetric
contributions to \Delta m_K and \epsilon_K are sufficiently suppressed without
spoiling naturalness, even if the flavor-violating supergravity contributions
to the sfermion mass matrices are included. When only the right-handed squarks
of the first-two generations have a common U(1)_X charge, we can still satisfy
the constraint from \Delta m_K naturally, but evading the bound from \epsilon_K
requires the CP phase smaller than 10^{-2}.

simplest non-trivial N=2 gauged Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories with
tensor multiplets. The scalar field target space of these examples is
SO(1,1)XSO(2,1)/SO(2). The possible gauge groups are SO(2)XU(1)_R and
SO(1,1)XU(1)_R, where U(1)_R is a subgroup of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_R, and
SO(2) and SO(1,1) are subgroups of the isometry group of the scalar manifold.
The scalar potentials of these theories consist of a contribution from the
U(1)_R gauging and a contribution that is due to the presence of the tensor
fields. We find that the latter contribution can change the form of the
supersymmetric extrema from maxima to saddle points. In addition, it leads to
novel critical points not present in the corresponding gauged
Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories without the tensor multiplets. For
the SO(2)XU(1)_R gauged theory these novel critical points correspond to
anti-de Sitter ground states. For the non-compact SO(1,1)XU(1)_R gauging, the
novel ground states are de Sitter. The analysis of the critical points of the
potential carries over in a straightforward manner to the generic family of N=2
gauged Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories coupled to tensor multiplets
whose scalar manifolds are of the form SO(1,1)XSO(n-1,1)/SO(n-1).

magnesium atoms immersed in superfluid helium have been measured at $(1.3\pm0.1
)$K between saturated vapour pressure and $24 $bar. The wavelength is blue
shifted linearly by $(0.07\pm0.01) \frac{nm}{bar}$. This value can be
satisfactorily described in the framework of the standard bubble model.

uncertainties are mimicked by classical spreads. It is shown how to express
those uncertainties through entities of the future unified theory of general
relativity and quantum theory.
