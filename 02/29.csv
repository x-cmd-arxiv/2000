the presence of an eventual cross-over to homogeneity still a matter of
considerable debate. In this letter we discuss the cosmological implications of
a fractal distribution of matter, with a possible cross-over to homogeneity at
an undetermined scale R_{homo}. Contrary to what is generally assumed, we show
that, even when R_{homo} -> \infty, this possibility can be treated
consistently within the framework of the expanding universe solutions of
Friedmann. The fractal is a perturbation to an open cosmology in which the
leading homogeneous component is the cosmic background radiation (CBR). This
cosmology, inspired by the observed galaxy distributions, provides a simple
explanation for the recent data which indicate the absence of deceleration in
the expansion (q_o \approx 0). Correspondingly the `age problem' is also
resolved. Further we show that the model can be extended back from the
curvature dominated arbitrarily deep into the radiation dominated era, and we
discuss qualitatively the modifications to the physics of the anisotropy of the
CBR, nucleosynthesis and structure formation.

together this argues for a common mechanism of the X/gamma-ray production in
these objects. This mechanism is probably a property of the accretion flow only
since it does not depend on the nature of the compact object. In this paper, I
review the observational data paying most attention to the properties of the
temporal variability such as the time/phase lags that hopefully can help us to
discriminate between different theoretical models. I also discuss the models
developed to account for the basic observational facts. Particularly, I show
that the commonly used Compton cloud models with constant temperature cannot
explain variable sources without violating the energy conservation law.
Alternative models where time lags are related to the spectral evolution during
X-ray flares are discussed and compared with observations. Compton reflection
from the outer edge of the accretion disc is shown to markedly affect the time

deposition rates of the cooling flows, independently determined from the ASCA
spectra and ROSAT images, exhibit good agreement and exceed 1000 solar masses
per year in the largest systems. We confirm the presence of intrinsic X-ray
absorption in the clusters using a variety of spectral models. The measured
equivalent hydrogen column densities of absorbing material are sensitive to the
spectral models used in the analysis, varying from average values of a few
10^{20} atom/cm^2 for a simple isothermal emission model, to a few 10^{21}
atom/cm^2 using our preferred cooling flow models, assuming in each case that
the absorber lies in a uniform foreground screen. The true intrinsic column

X-ray absorber from observations in other wavebands. A significant part of the
X-ray absorption may be due to dust.

Early-type galaxies constitute only 44% of this galaxy population. Thirty-nine
percent are spiral galaxies, and 17% are mergers. The early-type galaxies
follow a tight and well-defined color-magnitude relation, with the exception of
a few outliers. The observed scatter is 0.029 +- 0.005 magnitudes in restframe
U-B. Most of the mergers lie close to the CM relation defined by the early-type
galaxies. They are bluer by only 0.07 +- 0.02 magnitudes, and the scatter in
their colors is 0.07 +- 0.04 magnitudes. Spiral galaxies in MS1054-03 exhibit a
large range in their colors. The bluest spiral galaxies are 0.7 magnitudes
bluer than the early-type galaxies, but the majority is within +- 0.2
magnitudes of the early-type galaxy sequence. The red colors of the mergers and
the majority of the spiral galaxies are reflected in the fairly low
Butcher-Oemler blue fraction of MS1054-03: f_B=0.22 +- 0.05. The slope and
scatter of the CM relation of early-type galaxies are roughly constant with
redshift, confirming previous studies that were based on ground-based color
measurements and very limited membership information. However, the scatter in
the combined sample of early-type galaxies and mergers is twice as high as the
scatter of the early-type galaxies alone. This is a direct demonstration of the
``progenitor bias'': high redshift early-type galaxies seem to form a
homogeneous, old population because the progenitors of the youngest present-day
early-type galaxies are not included in the sample.

improves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detect
more microlensing events with faint source stars. We find this method increases
the number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysis
technique. DIA light curves of the events are presented and the microlensing

that our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with the
distribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar mass
function of Scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. However, we note that as
there is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,
there is uncertainty in this conclusion. Based on our event timescale

brown dwarfs in the direction of the Galactic bulge.

the 0.8-10keV band, which can be modeled as a power law plus a soft component.
Both, the spectrum and the uncorrelated flux variations indicate the presence
of a soft X-ray excess, which might be the high-energy extension of the intense
UV bump emission found in this quasar. The hard X-ray emission is dominated by
the flat power law (photon index 1.1-1.5). The results are consistent with

line emission as reported in a previous Ginga observation (Lawson & Turner

line-like feature around 1.25keV (1.63keV in the quasar frame) in both, the SIS

large spatial extent to be clusters but may be filaments along the line of

496 appears to be a quite relaxed cluster, except perhaps for the distribution
of emission line galaxies. These appear to be distributed in two samples
falling on to the main cluster, one from the back (the ELGs concentrated
towards the west) and one from the front (the high velocity ELGs). The bright

function for faint galaxies. The deeper galaxy counts derived from CCD imaging
show a dip at R$\sim 19.5$ (M$_{\rm R} \sim -17$) which can be modelled

The present model, unlike the Rouse model, can describe the solution's
rheological behavior even when the solvent quality is good, since excluded
volume effects are explicitly taken into account through a narrow Gaussian
repulsive potential between pairs of beads in a bead-spring chain. The use of
the narrow Gaussian potential, which tends to the more commonly used
delta-function repulsive potential in the limit of a width parameter ""d"" going
to zero, enables the performance of Brownian dynamics simulations. The
simulations results, which describe the exact behavior of the model, indicate
that for chains of arbitrary but finite length, a delta-function potential
leads to equilibrium and zero shear rate properties which are identical to the
predictions of the Rouse model. On the other hand, a non-zero value of ""d""
gives rise to a prediction of swelling at equilibrium, and an increase in zero
shear rate properties relative to their Rouse model values. The use of a
delta-function potential appears to be justified in the limit of infinite chain
length. The exact simulation results are compared with those obtained with an
approximate solution which is based on the assumption that the non-equilibrium
configurational distribution function is Gaussian. The Gaussian approximation
is shown to be exact to first order in the strength of excluded volume

atomic mixing length, roughness and information depth. The so called
mxing-roughness-information depth (MRI)-model and its application to the
quantitative reconstruction of the in-depth distribution of composition, with a
typical accuracy of one monolayer and better, is demonstrated for SIMS and AES

canonical theories. In the last few years several spin foam models of gravity
have been proposed, most of which live on finite simplicial lattice spacetime.
The lattice truncates the presumably infinite set of gravitational degrees of
freedom down to a finite set. Models that can accomodate an infinite set of
degrees of freedom and that are independent of any background simplicial
structure, or indeed any a priori spacetime topology, can be obtained from the
lattice models by summing them over all lattice spacetimes. Here we show that
this sum can be realized as the sum over Feynman diagrams of a quantum field
theory living on a suitable group manifold, with each Feynman diagram defining
a particular lattice spacetime. We give an explicit formula for the action of
the field theory corresponding to any given spin foam model in a wide class
which includes several gravity models. Such a field theory was recently found
for a particular gravity model [De Pietri et al, hep-th/9907154]. Our work
generalizes this result as well as Boulatov's and Ooguri's models of three and
four dimensional topological field theories, and ultimately the old matrix
models of two dimensional systems with dynamical topology. A first version of

demonstrated the existence of free fermionic heterotic-string models in which

of intrinsic stringy origin. We study its phenomenological characteristics and
the consequences in the case that $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ remains unbroken down to
low energies. We suggest that observation in forthcoming colliders of a

different couplings for the heavy generation may provide evidence for the

distinguish between classically integrable and non-integrable billiards. In
three dimensions the time-averaged mean breadth of the probability density may
also be used for this purpose.

relativistic and non-relativistic mean field theories. Collective excitations
in some even--even proton-rich nuclei in the upper $pf$ shell are investigated
using the Projected Shell Model with the new Nilsson basis. It is found that
the regular bands are sharply disturbed by band crossings involving $1g_{9/2}$
neutrons and protons. Physical quantities for exploring the nature of the band
disturbance and the role of the $1g_{9/2}$ single-particle are predicted, which
may be tested by new experiments with radioactive beams.

Thermal expansion of small metal clusters is considerably larger than that in
the bulk and size-dependent. We demonstrate that the average static electric
dipole polarizability of Na clusters depends linearly on the mean interatomic
distance and only to a minor extent on the detailed ionic configuration when
the overall shape of the electron density is enforced by electronic shell
effects. The polarizability is thus a sensitive indicator for thermal
expansion. We show that taking this effect into account brings theoretical and
experimental polarizabilities into quantitative agreement.

Hilbert space for arbitrary $M$ and $N$ ($M\leq N$) and with a positive partial
transpose (PPT) $\varrho^{T_A}\ge 0$. For rank $r(\varrho) \leq N$ we prove
that having a PPT is necessary and sufficient for $\varrho$ to be separable; in
this case we also provide its minimal decomposition in terms of pure product
states. It follows from this result that there is no rank 3 bound entangled
states having a PPT. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for
the separability of generic density matrices for which the sum of the ranks of
$\varrho$ and $\varrho^{T_A}$ satisfies $r(\varrho)+r(\varrho^{T_A}) \le
2MN-M-N+2$. This separability condition has the form of a constructive check,
providing thus also a pure product state decomposition for separable states,
and it works in those cases where a system of couple polynomial equations has a
finite number of solutions, as expected in most cases.

double intensity and dark periods, the mean duration of the three intensity
periods and the mean rate of their occurrence. We predict, to our knowledge for
the first time, cooperative effects for double jumps, for atomic distances from
one and to ten wave lengths of the strong transition. The double jump rate, as
a function of the atomic distance, can show oscillations of up to 30% at
distances of about a wave length, and oscillations are still noticeable at a
distance of ten wave lengths. The cooperative effects of the quantities and
their characteristic behavior turn out to be strongly dependent on the laser
detuning.
