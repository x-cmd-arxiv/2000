baryonic dark matter is required. We discuss the underlying assumptions of

young, Galactic open clusters that contain Cepheids. Each cluster contains or
is associated with at least one Cepheid variable star. Reddening to the
clusters is estimated using the U-B:B-V colours of the OB stars and the
distance modulus to the cluster is estimated via B-V:V and V-K:V
colour-magnitude diagrams. By main-sequence fitting we proceed to calibrate the
Cepheid P-L relation and find M_V=-2.81xlogP-1.33 +/-0.32 and
M_K=-3.44xlogP-2.20 +/-0.29 and a distance modulus to the LMC of 18.55+/-0.32
in the V-band and 18.47+/-0.29 in the K-band giving an overall distance modulus
to the LMC of 18.51+/-0.3.
  In the case of two important clusters we find that the U-B:B-V diagram in
these clusters is not well fitted by the standard Main Sequence line. In one
case, NGC7790, we find that the F stars show a UV excess which if caused by
metallicity would imply Fe/H ~ -1.5; this is anomalously low compared to what
is expected for young open clusters. In a second case, NGC6664, the U-B:B-V
diagram shows too red U-B colours for the F stars which in this case would
imply a higher than solar metallicity. If these effects are due to metallicity
then it would imply that the Cepheid PL(V) and PL(K) zeropoints depend on
metallicity according to delta(M)/delta(Fe/H) ~0.66 in the sense that lower
metallicity Cepheids are intrinsically fainter. Medium-high resolution
spectroscopy for the main-sequence F stars in these two clusters is needed to
determine if metallicity really is the cause or whether some other explanation
applies.

of 32 far-IR-bright starburst galaxies. In 18 cases, the line is produced
primarily by interstellar gas, and in 12 of these it is blueshifted by over 100
km/s relative to the galaxy systemic velocity. The absorption-line profiles in
these outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity to
a maximum blueshift of 400 to 600 km/s. The outflows occur in galaxies
systematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. We therefore argue
that the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar gas accelerated
along the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. The NaD
lines are optically-thick, but indirect arguments imply total Hydrogen column
densities of N_H = few X 10^{21} cm^{-2}. This implies that the superwind is
expelling matter at a rate comparable to the star-formation rate. This
outflowing material is very dusty: we find a strong correlation between the
depth of the NaD profile and the line-of-sight reddening (E(B-V) = 0.3 to 1
over regions several-to-ten kpc in size). The estimated terminal velocities of
superwinds inferred from these data and extant X-ray data are typically 400 to
800 km/s, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to
(substantially exceed) the escape velocities for $L_*$ (dwarf) galaxies. The
resulting loss of metals can establish the mass-metallicity relation in
spheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the ICM, and enrich a general
IGM to 10$^{-1}$ solar metallicity. If the outflowing dust grains survive their
journey into the IGM, their effect on observations of cosmologically-distant

carefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects and
carrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal from
artificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics. We
also verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shear
in adjacent cells. Including (gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shear
variance to be (0.016)^2 plus/minus (0.012)^2 plus/minus (0.006)^2, where these
1 sigma errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties,
respectively. Our measurements are consistent with the predictions of
cluster-normalised CDM models (within 1 sigma) but a COBE-normalised SCDM model
is ruled out at the 3.0 sigma level. For the currently-favoured Lambda-CDM
model (with Omega_m = 0.3), our measurement provides a normalisation of the
mass power spectrum of sigma_8 = 1.5 plus/minus 0.5, fully consistent with that
derived from cluster abundances. Our result demonstrates that ground-based
telescopes can, with adequate care, be used to constrain the mass power
spectrum on various scales. The present results are limited mainly by cosmic
variance, which can be overcome in the near future with more observations.

  Revised to fix typos, figure",,"10.1117/12.390436",,"astro-ph",,"  The emerging technology of large (~ 10,000 pixel) submillimeter-wave
bolometer arrays presents a novel optical design problem---how can such arrays
be fed by diffraction-limited telescope optics where the primary mirror is less
than 100,000 wavelengths in diameter? Standard Cassegrain designs for
radiotelescope optics exhibit focal surface curvature so large that detectors
cannot be placed more than 25 beam diameters from the central ray. The problem
is worse for Ritchey-Cretien designs, because these minimize coma while
increasing field curvature. Classical aberrations, including coma, are usually
dominated by diffraction in submillimeter-wave single dish telescopes. The
telescope designer must consider (1) diffraction, (2) aberration, (3) curvature
of field, (4) cross-polarization, (5) internal reflections, (6) the effect of
blockages, (7) means of beam chopping on- and off-source, (8) gravitational and
thermal deformations of the primary mirror, (9) the physical mounting of large
detector packages, and (10) the effect of gravity and (11) vibration on those
detectors. Simultaneous optimization of these considerations in the case of
large detector arrays leads to telescopes that differ considerably from
standard radiotelescope designs. Offset optics provide flexibility for mounting
detectors, while eliminating blockage and internal reflections. Aberrations and
cross-polarization can be the same as on-axis designs having the same diameter
and focal length. Trade-offs include the complication of primary mirror
homology and an increase in overall cost. A dramatic increase in usable field
of view can be achieved using shaped optics. Solutions having one to six
mirrors will be discussed, including a possible six-mirror design for the
proposed South Pole 10m telescope.

most of the stars in our sample we find good agreement with the dilution
predictions. However, the more massive cool stars with upper limits of Li
abundances show a significant discrepancy with the theoretical predictions,
even if the Non-LTE effects are taken into account. For the rotation behaviour,
our analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low
rotational rate, while more massive stars are slowed down only when reaching
the subgiant branch. We also checked the connection between the observed
rotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the
convective envelope. Our results shed new light on the lithium and rotation
discontinuities in the evolved phase.

calculation, especially in the complexity and size of the systems studied, as

tight-binding Hamiltonians which can describe chemical bonding, and have a
computational time proportional to the number of atoms N in the system, are of
particular interest for simulations in material science. By contrast
conventional diagonalization schemes scale as $N^{3}$. In combination with
judiciously fitted parameters and an implementation suited for MD, it is
possible to apply such \emph{O(N)} methods to structural, electronic and
dynamical properties of large systems which include up to 1000 atoms on a

  Following a brief review of a tight-binding based linear-scaling method based

covalently bonded systems, we present recent test calculations on
\emph{Si(111)-5 $\times$}5 and \emph{Si(001)-c(4$\times$}2) reconstructed

distance.
  This result is especially striking, since at large scales, the total density
fluctuation exhibits exponentially damped decay similar to the decay in simple
liquids. Thus at medium and large distances, the atoms with extreme values of

  To describe the confined electron properties explicitly to the second order
of perturbations in powers of the electron-phonon coupling constant we use the

In the case of the rectangular potential, the sum over all intermediate virtual
states is calculated. The comparison is made with the often used leading term
approximation when only the ground-state is taken into account as a virtual
state. It is shown that the results are quite different, so the incorporation
of all virtual states and especially those of the continuous spectrum is
essential.
  Our model reproduces the correct three-dimensional asymptotics at both small

in all settings where a certain staffing level must be guaranteed beyond the
capacity of single employees, such as for instance in industrial plants,
hospitals, or airline companies. Results from ergonomics \cite{BEST91} indicate
that rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and
social life of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover,
rotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also
meet the objectives of the employing organization. We describe our solution to
this problem. A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining
high-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human
control. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore
consists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work
block is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a
particular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal
weekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the
chosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences
of shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while
fulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint
satisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each
of the four steps allows to find good solutions for real-world problems in
acceptable time. Computational results from real-world problems and from
benchmark examples found in the literature confirm the viability of our
approach. The algorithms are now part of a commercial shift scheduling software
package.

usual critical surface $S_{c}$ (attraction domain of the Wilson-Fisher fixed
point), we explicitly show the existence of a first-order phase transition
domain $S_{f}$ separated from $S_{c}$ by the tricritical surface $S_{t}$
(attraction domain of the Gaussian fixed point). $S_{f}$ and $S_{c}$ are two
distinct domains of repulsion for the Gaussian fixed point, but $S_{f}$ is not
the basin of attraction of a fixed point. $S_{f}$ is characterized by an
endless renormalized trajectory lying entirely in the domain of negative values
of the $\phi ^{4}$-coupling. This renormalized trajectory exists also in four
dimensions making the Gaussian fixed point ultra-violet stable (and the
$\phi_{4}^{4}$ renormalized field theory asymptotically free but with a wrong
sign of the perfect action). We also show that very retarded classical-to-Ising
crossover may exist in three dimensions (in fact below four dimensions). This
could be an explanation of the unexpected classical critical behavior observed
in some ionic systems.

proofs are much more involved. However, unlike in the Turritin theorem, even
after ramification, in the p-adic theory there are irreducible objects of rank
>1. The first part is devoted to the definition of p-adic slopes and to a
decomposition along p-adic slopes theorem. The case of slope 0 (p-adic analogue
of the regular singular case) was already studied in the paper with the same

vertices of the Newton polygon built from p-adic slopes are proved to have
integral components (analogue of the Hasse-Arf theorem). After the work of the
second author, existence of index implies finitness of p-adic
(Monsky-Washnitzer) cohomology for affine varieties over finite fields. The end

whatever we can do for smooth ones. Intersection homology, for example,
directly produces groups associated to any variety which have almost all the

theory suggests the possibility of working more indirectly by relating any
singular variety to a variety which is smooth or nearly so.
  Here we use ideas from minimal model theory to define some characteristic
numbers for singular varieties, generalizing the Chern numbers of a smooth
variety. This was suggested by Goresky and MacPherson as a next natural problem
after the definition of intersection homology. We find that only a subspace of
the Chern numbers can be defined for singular varieties. A convenient way to
describe this subspace is to say that a smooth variety has a fundamental class
in complex bordism, whereas a singular variety can at most have a fundamental
class in a weaker homology theory, elliptic homology. We use this idea to give
an algebro-geometric definition of elliptic homology: ``complex bordism modulo
flops equals elliptic homology.''

presence of the electron cloud that screens fusing nuclei. The present work
studies the influence of electron screening deformations on solar reaction
rates in the framework of the Debye-Huckel model. These electron-ion cloud
deformations, assumed here to be static and axially symmetric, are shown to be
able to considerably influence the solar neutrino fluxes of the pp and the CNO
chains, with reasonable changes in the macroscopic parameters of the standard
solar model (SSM) . Various known deformation sources are discussed but none of
them is found strong enough to have a significant impact on the SSM neutrino
fluxes.

considerations, it is shown that: (1) Due to density dependence of asymmetry
energy, some of the neutron excess from the high-density phase could be
expelled into the low-density region. (2) Formation of clusters in the gas
phase tends to counteract this trend, making the gas phase more liquid-like and
reducing the asymmetry in the gas phase. Flow of asymmetry between the

temporal correlations and functional relations within and between point
processes. This paper begins with a review of these quantities, their
interpretation and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how to assess the
statistical significance of features in these measures is included. In
addition, new work is presented which builds on the framework established in
the review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error
bars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived
based on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the
rate functions are drawn from a low variance Gaussian process. It is found
that, in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators
cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale which is set by the number of
point events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the
estimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of
point events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a
method for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also
presented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the
underlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test,
applicable to continuous processes, applies, with little modification, to point
process spectra, and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a
continuous stimulus. While the material discussed is of general applicability
to point processes attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action
potentials (spike trains) which were the motivation for this work.

matter, fields and time from few ground postulates (Kaivarainen, 1995-2006).
The original Bivacuum model considers the positive and negative vacuum as a
superfluid quantum liquid, composed from dipoles: [torus + antitorus] of
opposite energies, charges and magnetic moments, representing collective
excitations of subquantum particles and antiparticles. Such BIVACUUM, is an
infinitive source of Bivacuum fermions (BVF) and Bivacuum bosons (BVB). They
may assemble by 'head-to tail' principle the closed or open Virtual
microtubules (VirMT) and Virtual Guides (VirG) of spin, momentum and energy.
The VirG represent quasi-1D Bose condensate and connect remote coherent
elementary particles. The bundles of VirG composing 3D net in space, provide
the superfluid and nonlocal fraction of Bivacuum. The proposed Dynamic Model of
Corpuscle [C]-Wave [W] duality interrelates the internal (hidden) parameters of
sub-elementary fermions and their external, observable ones. The fusion of
sub-elementary fermions to triplets at their symmetry shift determined by
Golden mean conditions produce electrons, protons and neutrons. The different
kind of Bivacuum matrix perturbation and excitation, accompanied [C-W]
pulsation of elementary fermions and their fast rotation, are responsible for
electrostatic, magnetic and gravitational fields excitation. The pace of time
for any closed system is shown to be determined by pace of internal kinetic
energy change of this system. Our relativistic formula for time contains beside
the velocity also the acceleration.
