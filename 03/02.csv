showers created by neutrino interactions close to the detector must be picked
out against a background of similar events initiated by cosmic ray nuclei. As a
step towards understanding this background, we have made the first detailed
analysis of air showers recorded at Haverah Park (an array which used similar

60 degs. We find that the differential shower rate from 60 degs to 80 degs. can

relatively small, $M \sim 10^{5-7}M_\odot$, and that a disk shines nearly at
the Eddington luminosity, $L_{\rm E}$. Then, the disk becomes a slim disk and
exhibits the following distinctive signatures: (1) The disk luminosity
(particularly of X-rays) is insensitive to mass-flow rates, $\dot M$, since the
generated energy is partly carried away to the black hole by trapped photons in
accretion flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody. The maximum
blackbody temperature is $T_{\rm bb} \simeq 0.2(M/10^5 M_\odot)^{-1/4}$ keV,
and the size of the blackbody emitting region is small, $r_{\rm bb} \lsim 3
r_{\rm S}$ (with $r_{\rm S}$ being Schwarzschild radius) even for a
Schwarzschild black hole. (3) All the ASCA observation data of NLS1s fall onto
the region of $\dot M/(L_{\rm E}/c^2)>10$ (with $L_{\rm E}$ being the Eddington
luminosity) on the ($r_{\rm bb},T_{\rm bb}$) plane, supporting our view that a
slim disk emits soft X-rays at $\sim L_{\rm E}$ in NLS1s. (4) Magnetic energy
can be amplified, at most, up to the equipartition value with the trapped
radiation energy which greatly exceeds radiation energy emitted from the disk.
Hence, energy release by consecutive magnetic reconnection will give rise to
substantial variability in soft X-ray emission.

strong dependence on the choice of model. Preference to one particular spectral
model can only be given by combining spectroscopic and imaging X-ray data from
all available satellites (ROSAT, ASCA, and BeppoSAX). Based on spectra of NGC
253, we demonstrate that a model consisting of two or more thermal plasma
components plus a hard power law continuum and Fe K alpha line emission can
explain all observations. These model components represent the integral
spectrum of thermal gas and compact sources in starburst galaxies that are most
likely supernova remnants and X-ray binaries. The same model can fit the X-ray

compact sources which might represent high-mass X-ray binaries is weaker. This

derive the exact effective many-body density matrix of the measured system plus
pointer. We then discuss the interpretation of the dynamics considered as the
first stage in the process of quantum measurement, eventually involving the
wave-function collapse due to interactions with ""the rest of the universe."" We
establish that the effective density matrix represents the required framework
for the measured system and the pointer part of the measuring device to evolve
into a statistical mixture described by direct-product states such that the
system is in each eigenstate of $\Lambda$ with the correct quantum-mechanical
probability, whereas the expectation values of pointer-space operators retain

the fluctuations change the free energy structure from a $ \phi ^{4}$ to a
$\phi ^{6}$ form with the disordered state metastable for all quench depths.
The transition from the disordered to the periodic, lamellar structure changes
from second order to first order and suggests that the dynamics is governed by
nucleation. Using numerical simulations we have confirmed that the equilibrium
free energy function is indeed of a $ \phi ^{6}$ form. A study of the dynamics,
however, shows that, following a deep quench, the dynamics is described by
unstable growth rather than nucleation. A dynamical calculation, based on a

can remain unstable for a long time following the quench.

execute due to their complex nature. Query response times can be greatly
improved by caching final/intermediate results of previous queries, and using
them to answer later queries. In this paper we describe a caching system called
Exchequer which incorporates several novel features including optimization
aware cache maintenance and the use of a cache aware optimizer. In contrast, in
existing work, the module that makes cost-benefit decisions is part of the
cache manager and works independent of the optimizer which essentially
reconsiders these decisions while finding the best plan for a query. In our
work, the optimizer takes the decisions for the cache manager. Furthermore,
existing approaches are either restricted to cube (slice/point) queries, or
cache just the query results. On the other hand, our work is extens ible and in
fact presents a data-model independent framework and algorithm. Our
experimental results attest to the efficacy of our cache management techniques
and show that over a wide range of parameters (a) Exchequer's query response
times are lower by more than 30% compared to the best performing competitor,
and (b) Exchequer can deliver the same response time as its competitor with
just one tenth of the cache size.

Whenever the data warehouse is updated, the materialized views must also be

window available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends
necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.
  In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a
{\em set} of views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view
maintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized
temporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose
subexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along
with other materialized views), to speed up view maintenance. While there has
been much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in
exploiting a recently developed framework for multiquery optimization to
efficiently find good view maintenance plans as above. In addition to faster
view maintenance, our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select
materialized views to speed up workloads containing queries.

is crucial in order to determine the value of $V_{ud}$ as precisely as

crude estimate of the effect of the hadronic structure. Only the contribution
due to the axial current depends on the hadronic environment. We develop a
strategy to deal with the influence of the hadronic structure on the decay
properties of the simplest hadron, the pion, and calculate the contribution of
the axial vector current to the RC, using a light-front model for the pion. Its
$q\bar{q}$ bound state structure is well described by two parameters,
constituent quark mass and confinement scale, that have been fixed by a
comparison with the data. We take into consideration three different groups of
two-loop diagrams, and derive their light-front representations. We discuss the
associated zero-mode problem and show that the respective light-front
amplitudes are free of spurious contributions. There is only a small model

polynomials on V.
  In this paper we study when the Fourier transform of an elementary function
is elementary. If Q has a nonzero Hessian, a necessary condition for this is
that the Legendre transform Q_* of Q is rational. The basic example is a
nondegenerate quadratic form. We study such functions Q, give examples, and
find all of them such that both Q and Q_* are of the form f(x)/t, where f is a
cubic form in many variables (the simplest case after quadratic forms). It
turns out that this classification is closely related to Zak's classification
of Severi varieties.
  The second half of the paper is devoted to finding and classifying elementary
functions with elementary Fourier transforms when Q is a fixed function with
rational Q_*. We consider the simplest case when Q is a monomial, and classify
combinations of multiplicative characters that can arise. The answer (for real
and complex fields) is given in terms of exact covering systems. We also
describe examples related to prehomogeneous vector spaces. Finally, we consider
examples over p-adic fields, and in particular give a local proof of an

friction is analyzed. The working fluid of the engine is composed of an
ensemble of noninteracting two level systems. External work is applied by
changing the external field and thus the internal energy levels. The friction
induces a minimal cycle time. The power output of the engine is optimized with
respect to time allocation between the contact time with the hot and cold baths
as well as the adiabats. The engine's performance is also optimized with
respect to the external fields. By reversing the cycle of operation a heat pump
is constructed. The performance of the engine as a heat pump is also optimized.
By varying the time allocation between the adiabats and the contact time with
the reservoir a universal behavior can be identified. The optimal performance
of the engine when the cold bath is approaching absolute zero is studied. It is
found that the optimal cooling rate converges linearly to zero when the
temperature approaches absolute zero.
