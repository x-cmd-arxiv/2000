superbubbles have been proposed to account for the observed abundances of Be
and B in metal-poor halo stars. We analyse some of the implications of these
models for the distribution of the Be/O and B/O abundance ratios. In
particular, we discuss the possible scatter in the data and argue that LiBeB
production in the very early Galaxy was probably bimodal, with isolated
supernovae giving rise to a low-efficiency mechanism, and collective supernovae
exploding in an OB association inducing a high-efficiency mechanism. This
should produce two populations of halo stars, one with high L/M ratios (light
elements/metals), and the other with L/M ratios about ten times lower. The
relative weight of these two populations depends on the fraction of supernovae
exploding inside superbubbles. In this context, we discuss the recent
observation of the B-depleted, Li-normal star HD 160617 (Primas, et al., 1998),
as well as the reported spread in the Be data at [Fe/H] ~ -2.2 (Boesgaard, et
al., 1999). Finally, we predict that Be will be found to be even more deficient
than B in HD 160617.

circular-orbit binary system. Our aim is to determine whether, if the disk is
initially tilted with respect to the plane of the binary orbit, the inclination
of the system will increase or decrease with time. The problem is formulated in
the binary frame in which the tidal potential of the companion star is static.
We consider a steady, flat disk that is aligned with the binary plane and
investigate its linear stability with respect to tilting or warping
perturbations. The dynamics is controlled by the competing effects of the m=0
and m=2 azimuthal Fourier components of the tidal potential. In the presence of
dissipation, the m=0 component causes alignment of the system, while the m=2
component has the opposite tendency. We find that disks that are sufficiently
large, in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii, are
generally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on
a time-scale comparable to that found in previous studies. However, the effect
of the m=2 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer
radius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode
of the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency. Under such
circumstances, the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape,
even in the absence of dissipation. The outer radius corresponding to the
primary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius. For disks
smaller than the primary resonance, the m=2 component may be able to cause a
very slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that
occurs close to the disk center. We discuss these results in the light of
recent observations of protostellar disks in binary systems.

evidence for the dominance of a reflection component, i.e. emission from cool

ASCA simultaneously, we satisfactorily modeled the AGN spectrum with a Compton
reflection component and probably a transmitted AGN component penetrating
through a thick absorber. The X-ray luminosity of the AGN is estimated to be in
the range 4x10^43 - 6x10^44 ergs/s in the range 2-10keV, which categorizes

  Most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excited

non-dissociative (C-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere along
both lobes of the flow. We confirm the low-excitation nature of the Herbig-Haro
nebulosities, with shock velocities <40-50 km/s. Toward both lobes of the

exciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the C-shock component is
n_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. We propose that
the deficiency of gas-phase water in the post C-shock regions is due to
freezing onto warm grains processed through the J-shock front and traveling
along the magnetic field lines. The total observed cooling from the
dissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slow
molecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral HI wind.

``cleared-dust'' models, which account for the removal of refractory species
from the molecular states but do not include dust opacities. We find a tendency
for the RbI line to imply a slightly higher temperature, which we ascribe to an
incomplete treatment of the overlying molecular opacities. The final effective
temperatures we adopt are based on the CsI fits alone, though the RbI fits
support the CsI temperature sequence. This work, in combination with results
from the infrared, hints that dust in these atmospheres has settled out of the
high atmosphere but is present in the deep photosphere. We also derive radial
and rotational velocities for all the objects, finding that the previously

pervasive. To improve on our analysis, there is a clear need for better

assumptions about the scaling of the power spectrum with redshift; all
treatments to date assume a simple power law scaling. In reality, different
scales grow at different rates, due to non-linearities. We show that angular
surveys are sensitive to a weighted average of the power spectrum over a
distribution of redshifts, where the weight function varies with wavenumber. We
compute this weight function and show that it is fairly sharply peaked at
\bar{z}, which is a function of k. As long as the extracted power spectrum is
understood to be $P(k,\bar{z})$, the error introduced by non-linear scaling is
quantifiable and small. We study these effects in the context of the APM and
SDSS photometric surveys. In general the weight matrix is peaked at larger z
and is broader for deeper surveys, leading to larger (but still quantifiable)
errors due to non-linear scaling. The tools introduced here -- in particular
the weight function and effective redshift $\bar{z}$ -- can also be profitably
applied to plan surveys to study the evolution of the power spectrum.

microns (approximately J-band) are presented for each source. At this
resolution, a rich spectral structure is revealed, much of which is due to
blending of unresolved molecular transitions. Strong lines due to neutral
potassium (K I), and bands due to iron hydride (FeH) and steam (H2O) change
significantly throughout the L sequence. Iron hydride disappears between L5 and

due to pressure broadening. An unidentified feature occurs at 1.22 microns

we discuss the origin of the temperature dependence of the resistivity and
reasons for this dependence to flatten out at some electron density in the

proposed to indicate a true quantum phase transition. We suggest an alternative
interpretation of this result and demonstrate the consistency of our
proposition with the experimental data. One of the main questions, which arise
in connection with the transition, is whether or not the metallic state is
qualitatively distinct from a conventional disordered Fermi liquid. We analyze
the arguments in favor of both affirmative and negative answers to this
question and conclude that the experimental results accumulated up-to-date do

manifested in the different temperature dependences of these two resistivities.
We also estimate the spin diffusion length and spin relaxation time scales, and
we argue that it should be experimentally feasible to measure the spin

is related to the volume dependence of the hybridization. The other is related
to local deformations produced by f- shell size fluctuations accompanying
valence fluctuations. The large f -state degeneracy allows us to use the 1/N

first-order valence phase transition in YbInCu_{4}. It is shown that the
Coulomb interaction enhances the exchange interaction between f and conduction
band electron spins and is the driving force of the phase transition. A

The most general dust solution can be written down explicitly and is described
by two parameters. The first one (E) corresponds to the asymptotic energy at
large $|z|$, while the second one (D) specifies the value of z at the
singularity which characterizes such models. The E=D=0 solution is just the
flat Friedmann model. The 1-parameter family of solutions with z>0 and D=0 are
inhomogeneous cosmological models which expand from a Big Bang singularity at
t=0 and are asymptotically Friedmann at large z; models with E>0 are everywhere
underdense relative to Friedmann and expand forever, while those with E<0 are
everywhere overdense and recollapse to a black hole containing another
singularity. The black hole always has an apparent horizon but need not have an
event horizon. The D=0 solutions with z<0 are just the time reverse of the z>0
ones. The 2-parameter solutions with D>0 again represent inhomogeneous
cosmological models but the Big Bang singularity is at $z=-1/D$, the Big Crunch
singularity is at $z=+1/D$, and any particular solution necessarily spans both
z<0 and z>0. While there is no static model in the dust case, all these
solutions are asymptotically ``quasi-static'' at large $|z|$. As in the D=0
case, the ones with $E \ge 0$ expand or contract monotonically but the latter
may now contain a naked singularity. The ones with E<0 expand from or
recollapse to a second singularity, the latter containing a black hole.

existence of large-scale cosmic voids. There is also a 1-parameter family of
solutions asymptotic to a self-similar Kantowski-Sachs model at large z. These
are probably only physically realistic for $-1<\alpha<-1/3$, in which case they
may relate to the formation of bubbles in an inflationary universe. There is a
2-parameter family of solutions associated with a self-similar static solution
at large z. This family contains solutions with naked singularities and this

eigenvalues of complex systems. It also may serve as a schematic model for
disorder in quantum systems. In this review, we discuss both types of
applications of chiral random matrix theory to the QCD partition function. We
show that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking
determine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the
Dirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of
the QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these
eigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with
the global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such
eigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The
spectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical
hadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition
function. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many
lattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of
the chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of
the Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero
temperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results
for the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator. We
discuss the nature of the quenched approximation and analyze quenched Dirac
spectra at nonzero baryon density in terms of an effective partition function.
Relations with other fields are also discussed.

colour triviality, i.e., the property that for arbitrary N-fold rescattering
contributions the only non-vanishing colour trace is N_c C_F^N. We give proofs
for the colour triviality of the inelastic, diffractive and total
photoabsorption cross section measured inclusively or with one jet resolved in
the final state. Also, we list examples for which colour interference effects
remain. Colour triviality allows us to write the gamma -> q qbar contribution
to the DIS nuclear structure function F_2 for small Bjorken x in terms of a
path integral which describes the transverse size evolution of the q-qbar pair
in the nuclear colour field. This expression reduces in an opacity expansion to
the N=1 result of Nikolaev and Zakharov, and in the eikonal approximation to
the Glauber-type rescattering formulas first derived by Mueller. In the
harmonic oscillator approximation of the path integral, we quantify deviations
from the eikonal limit. Their onset is characterized by the scales L/l_f and
E_t L which relate the longitudinal extension L of the nuclear target to the
coherence length l_f and the total transverse energy E_t accumulated by the
q-qbar pair.

  <http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ddw/>",,,"formerly math.SC/0003018","math.NA",,"  Gau{\ss} cubature (multidimensional numerical integration) rules are the
natural generalisation of the 1D Gau{\ss} rules. They are optimal in the sense
that they exactly integrate polynomials of as high a degree as possible for a
particular number of points (function evaluations). For smooth integrands, they
are accurate, computationally efficient formulae.
  The construction of the points and weights of a Gau{\ss} rule requires the
solution of a system of moment equations. In 1D, this system can be converted
to a linear system, and a unique solution is obtained, for which the points lie
within the region of integration, and the weights are all positive. These
properties help ensure numerical stability, and we describe the rules as
`good'. In the multidimensional case, the moment equations are nonlinear
algebraic equations, and a solution is not guaranteed to even exist, let alone
be good. The size and degree of the system grow with the degree of the desired
cubature rule. Analytic solution generally becomes impossible as the degree of
the polynomial equations to be solved goes beyond 4, and numerical
approximations are required. The uncertainty of the existence of solutions,
coupled with the size and degree of the system makes the problem daunting for
numerical methods.
  The construction of Gau{\ss} rules for (fully symmetric) $n$-dimensional
regions is easily specialised to the case of $U_3$, the unit sphere in 3D.
Despite the problems described above, for degrees up to 17, good Gau{\ss} rules

the 171Yb fluorescence is interrupted by quantum jumps because a nonvanishing
rate of spontaneous transitions leads to electron shelving in the metastable
hyperfine sublevel 2D3/2(F=2). The average duration of the resulting dark
periods can be varied by changing the intensity of a repumping laser field.
Optical heterodyne detection is employed to analyze the fluorescence spectrum
near the Rayleigh elastic scattering peak. It is found that the stochastic
modulation of the fluorescence emission by quantum jumps gives rise to a
Lorentzian component in the fluorescence spectrum, and that the linewidth of
this component varies according to the average duration of the dark
fluorescence periods. The experimental observations are in quantitative
