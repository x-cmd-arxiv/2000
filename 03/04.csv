the large-scale structures of the Universe taking advantage of the lens effects
on the CMB polarization. The functional relation between the B component with
the primordial CMB polarization and the line-of-sight mass distribution is
explicited. Noting that a sizeable fraction (at least 40%) of the dark halo
population which is responsible of this effect can also be detected in galaxy
weak lensing survey, we present statistical quantities that should exhibit a
strong sensitivity to this overlapping. We stress that it would be a sound test
of the gravitational instability picture, independent on many systematic
effects that may hamper lensing detection in CMB or galaxy survey alone.
Moreover we estimate the intrinsic cosmic variance of the amplitude of this
effect to be less than 8% for a 100, deg^2 survey with a 10' CMB beam. Its
measurement would then provide us with an original mean for constraining the
cosmological parameters, more particularly, as it turns out, the cosmological

from the inner wall of dusty tori because type 1 Seyfert nuclei (S1s) show the
excess HINER emission with respect to type 2 Seyfert ones (S2s). This means
that the radiation from the HINER has the anisotropic property and thus
statistical properties of the HINER emission can be used to investigate the
viewing angle toward dusty tori for various types of Seyfert nuclei. In order
to investigate viewing angles toward various types of Seyferys, we apply this
HINER test to them.
  Our main results are as follows. (1) The NLS1s are viewed from a more face-on
view toward dusty tori than the S2s. However, the HINER properties of the NLS1s
are indistinguishable from those of the S1s. (2) The type 1.5 Seyferts appear
to comprise heterogeneous populations. (3) The type 1.8 and 1.9 Seyferts and
the objects showing either a broad Pa_beta line or polarized broad Balmer lines
are seen from a large inclination angle and the emission from the BLRs of such
objects reaches us through optically-thin parts of dusty tori. These three
results support strongly the current unified model of Seyfert nuclei. And, (4)
the line ratios of [Fe X]6374 to the low-ionization emission-lines have rather
isotropic property than those of [Fe VII]6087. Therefore it is suggested that
the [Fe X] emission is not useful investigating the viewing angle toward the

spectral quality is too poor to classify other three galaxies. Therefore, we

AGN, 16 HII nuclei, and 19 normal galaxies which show no emission line. We used
this HCG sample for statistical analyses. (2) Comparing the frequency
distributions of activity types between the HCGs and the field galaxies whose
data are taken from Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent (382 field galaxies), we find
that the frequency of HII nuclei in the HCGs is significantly less than that in
the field. However, this difference may be due to selection bias that our HCG
sample contains more early-type galaxies than the field, because it is known
that HII nuclei are rarer in early-type galaxies than in later ones. (3)
Applying correction this morphological bias to the HCG sample, we find that
there is no statistically significant difference in the frequency of occurrence
of emission-line galaxies between the HCGs and the field. This implies that the
dense galaxy environment in the HCGs does not affect triggering both the AGN
activity and the nuclear starburst. We discuss some implications on the nuclear

holes are constructed. The solutions are obtained by solving numerically a set
of ordinary differential equations corresponding to a steady axisymmetric
geometrically thin disk. We pay special attention to consistently satisfy the
regularity conditions at singular points of the equations. For this reason we
analytically expand a solution at the singular point, and use coefficients of
the expansion in our iterative numerical procedure. We obtain consistent
transonic solutions in a wide range of values of the viscosity parameter alpha
and mass acretion rate. We compare two different form of viscosity: one takes
the shear stress to be proportional to the pressure, while the other uses the
angular velocity gradient-dependent stress.
  We find that there are two singular points in solutions corresponding to the
pressure-proportional shear stress. The inner singular point locates close to
the last stable orbit around black hole. This point changes its type from a
saddle to node depending on values of alpha and accretion rate. The outer
singular point locates at larger radius and is always of a saddle-type. We
argue that, contrary to the previous investigations, a nodal-type inner
singular point does not introduce multiple solutions. Only one integral curve,
which corresponds to the unique global solution, passes simultaneously the
inner and outer singular points independently of the type of inner singular
point. Solutions with the angular velocity gradient-dependent shear stress have
one singular point which is always of a saddle-type and corresponds to the
unique global solution. The structure of accretion disks corresponding to both

calculated as a function of energy for several polar cap models with
curvature-radiation-induced cascades. The Monte Carlo results are interpreted
with the help of analytical approximations and discussed in view of the recent
data analysis for the Vela pulsar (Kanbach 1999). We find that the behaviour of
$\del$ as a function of photon energy $\epsilon$ depends primarily on local
values of the magnetic field, $B_{\rm local}$, in the region where
electromagnetic cascades develop. For low values of $B_{\rm local}$ ($<
10^{12}$ G), $\del(\epsilon)$ is kept constant. However, for stronger magnetic
fields ($\ga 10^{12}$ G) in the hollow-column model $\del$ decreases with
increasing photon energy at a rate dependent on maximum energy of beam
particles as well as on viewing geometry. There exists a critical photon energy
$\et$ above which the relation $\del(\epsilon)$ changes drastically: for
$\epsilon > \et$, in hollow-column models the separation $\del$ increases
(whereas in filled-column model it decreases) rapidly with increasing
$\epsilon$, at a rate of $\sim 0.28$ of the total phase per decade of photon
energy. The existence of critical energy $\et$ is a direct consequence of
one-photon magnetic absorption effects. In general, $\et$ is located close to
the high-energy cutoff of the spectrum, thus photon statistics at $\et$ should
be very low. That will make difficult to verify the existence of $\et$ in real
gamma-ray pulsars. Spectral properties of the Vela pulsar would favour those
models which use low values of magnetic field in the emission region ($B_{\rm
local} \simless 10^{11}$ G) which in turn implies a constant value of the
predicted $\del$ within EGRET range.

resolution of the MECS onboard BeppoSAX allow us to derive a new and
substantially improved measurement of the temperature structure. We find that,
within a central region of the cluster, where the effects of the merger are
visible in the ROSAT surface brightness image, the azimuthally averaged
projected temperature is remarkably flat; outside this region the projected
temperature rapidly declines. The BeppoSAX data also shows clear evidence of an
azimuthal temperature gradient in the 4'-8' (0.4-0.8 Mpc) radial bin, oriented
in the same direction as the merger itself. Our metal abundance profile shows,
for the first time, firm evidence of an abundance gradient in a rich merging
cluster. Intriguingly the abundance map shows, in the SE sector, i.e. the one
furthest away from the merger, a sharp factor of two drop in abundance at a
radius comparable to the core radius of the cluster. A possible interpretation
is that, prior to the merger event, a cooling flow had already developed in the
core of the infalling subgroup, as suggested by Fabian and Daines (1991). The
interaction between the substructures would have disrupted the cooling flow
thereby re-heating and re-mixing the gas. As the merger in A2256 is still in a
relatively early stage, the gas located on the side opposite to the merger
event would still retain the low abundances associated with the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) prior to the cooling flow disruption.

decreases by domain growth and increases by nucleation of new small domains
inside the larger ones. These two opposite variations are both hindered by
static random fields (equivalent to energy barriers) due to the frozen dipoles
borne by the off-center Li+ ions. Many results are well explained by a model

behaviour. Introducing disorder we restrict ourselves to the experimentally
most relevant case of weak uncorrelated randomness which is known to destroy
the long-ranged translational order of the Abrikosov lattice in three
dimensions. Elucidating possible residual glassy ordered phases, we distinguish
betwee positional and phase-coherent vortex glasses. The discussion of elastic
vortex glasses, in two and three dimensions occupy the main part of our review.
In particular, in three dimensions there exists an elastic vortex-glass phase
which still shows quasi-long-range translational order: the `Bragg glass'. It
is shown that this phase is stable with respect to the formation of
dislocations for intermediate fields. Preliminary results suggest that the
Bragg-glass phase may not show phase-coherent vortex-glass order. The latter is
expected to occur in systems with weak disorder only in higher dimensions. We
further demonstrate that the linear resistivity vanishes in the vortex-glass
phase. The vortex-glass transition is studied in detail for a superconducting
film in a parallel field. Finally, we review some recent developments
concerning driven vortex-line lattices moving in a random environment.

focusing on the two-orbital model with electrons interacting through
Jahn-Teller (JT) phonons and/or Coulombic repulsions. Analyzing the model
including both interactions by the combination of the mean-field approximation
and the exact diagonalization method, it is argued that the spin-charge-orbital
structure in the insulating phase of the purely JT-phononic model is not
qualitatively changed by the inclusion of the Coulomb interactions. As an
important application of the present mean-field approximation, the CE-type AFM
state, the charge-stacked structure along the z-axis, and the
(3x^2-r^2)/(3y^2-r^2)-type orbital ordering are successfully reproduced based
on the JT-phononic model for the half-doped manganite. Topological arguments
and the relevance of the Heisenberg exchange among localized t_{\rm 2g} spins
explains why the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction does not destroy the
charge stacking structure. It is also verified that the phase-separation
tendency is observed both in purely JT-phononic and purely Coulombic models in
the vicinity of the hole undoped region, as long as realistic hopping matrices
are used. This highlights the qualitative similarities of both approaches, and
the relevance of mixed-phase tendencies in the context of manganites. In
addition, the rich and complex phase diagram of the two-orbital Coulombic model
in one dimension is presented. Our results provide robust evidence that
Coulombic and JT-phononic approaches to manganites are not qualitatively
different ways to carry out theoretical calculations, but they share a variety

Renormalizability requires a quartic ghost interaction in these nonlinear

symmetry is dynamically broken by ghost-antighost condensation in a BCS-like
mechanism are presented. The scenario can be viewed as a dynamical Higgs
mechanism in the adjoint that gives massive off-diagonal gluons and a BRST
quartet of Goldstone bosonsthat decouples from physical observables. The gap
parameter is related to the expectation value of the trace anomaly and the
consistency of this scenario with the Operator Product Expansion is discussed.

Rev. E 63 (2001) 6226","10.1103/PhysRevE.63.036226",,"nlin.CD cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Spatially extended dynamical systems, namely coupled map lattices, driven by
additive spatio-temporal noise are shown to exhibit stochastic synchronization.
In analogy with low-dymensional systems, synchronization can be achieved only
if the maximum Lyapunov exponent becomes negative for sufficiently large noise
amplitude. Moreover, noise can suppress also the non-linear mechanism of
information propagation, that may be present in the spatially extended system.
A first example of phase transition is observed when both the linear and the
non-linear mechanisms of information production disappear at the same critical
value of the noise amplitude. The corresponding critical properties can be
hardly identified numerically, but some general argument suggests that they
could be ascribed to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Conversely,
when the non-linear mechanism prevails on the linear one, another type of phase
transition to stochastic synchronization occurs. This one is shown to belong to
the universality class of directed percolation.

  measurements of temperature, humidity and surface pressure","18 (jgr journal) pages, 7 figures",,"10.1029/2000JD900151",,"physics.ao-ph",,"  An optimal estimation inverse method is presented which can be used to
retrieve simultaneously vertical profiles of temperature and specific humidity,
in addition to surface pressure, from satellite-to-satellite radio occultation
observations of the Earth's atmosphere. The method is a non-linear, maximum
{\it a posteriori} technique which can accommodate most aspects of the real
radio occultation problem and is found to be stable and to converge rapidly in
most cases. The optimal estimation inverse method has two distinct advantages
over the analytic inverse method in that it accounts for some of the effects of
horizontal gradients and is able to retrieve optimally temperature and humidity
simultaneously from the observations. It is also able to account for
observation noise and other sources of error. Combined, these advantages ensure
a realistic retrieval of atmospheric quantities.
  A complete error analysis emerges naturally from the optimal estimation
theory, allowing a full characterisation of the solution. Using this analysis a
quality control scheme is implemented which allows anomalous retrieval
conditions to be recognised and removed, thus preventing gross retrieval
errors.
  The inverse method presented in this paper has been implemented for bending
angle measurements derived from GPS/MET radio occultation observations of the
Earth. Preliminary results from simulated data suggest that these observations
have the potential to improve NWP model analyses significantly throughout their
vertical range.

design goal for the cavities of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) linac was set to
the more moderate value of Eacc >= 15 MV/m. In a first series of 27
industrially produced TTF cavities the average gradient at Q0 = 5E+9 was
measured to be 20.1 +- 6.2 MV/m, excluding a few cavities suffering from
serious fabrication or material defects. In the second production of 24 TTF
cavities additional quality control measures were introduced, in particular an
eddy-current scan to eliminate niobium sheets with foreign material inclusions
and stringent prescriptions for carrying out the electron-beam welds. The
average gradient of these cavities at Q0 = 5E+9 amounts to 25.0 +- 3.2 MV/m
with the exception of one cavity suffering from a weld defect. Hence only a
moderate improvement in production and preparation techniques will be needed to
meet the ambitious TESLA goal with an adequate safety margin. In this paper we
present a detailed description of the design, fabrication and preparation of
the TESLA Test Facility cavities and their associated components and report on
cavity performance in test cryostats and with electron beam in the TTF linac.
The ongoing R&D towards higher gradients is briefly addressed.
