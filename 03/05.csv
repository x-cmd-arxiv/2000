of primordial black holes, since they can break the relatively quiescent
homogeneity and isotropy of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmologies. These
epochs of ""symmetry breaking,"" moreover, can affect the subsequent development
of spacetime by changing the evolution of some FRW parameters, including the
present age and density of the universe. We discuss the relative importance of
such effects on constraining mechanisms of black hole formation.

  five pages, no figures","Spacetime $ Substance Journal, vol 2(7), (2001) 49",,,"astro-ph",,"  It has been proven recently that the Standard Model of particle physics has
electric charge quantization built into it. It has also been shown by the
author that there was no electric charge in the early universe. Further it is
shown here that the restoration of the full Standard Model symmetry (as in the
Early Universe) leads to the result that `time', `light', along with it's
velocity c and the theory of relativity, all lose any physical meaning. The
physical Universe as we know it, with its space-time structure, disappears in
this phase transition. Hence it is hypothesized here that the Universe came
into existence when the Standard Model symmetry $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L
\otimes U(1)_Y$ was spontaneously broken to $SU(3)_C \otimes U(1)_{em}$. This
does not require any spurious extensions of the Standard Model and in a simple
and consistent manner explains the origin of the Universe within the framework
of the Standard Model itself.

transition temperature. Monte Carlo simulation results exhibit bond ordering at
intermediate temperatures uncorrelated with any long-range structural ordering.
Also discussed are various other implications of bond-ordering model for glass

behaviour, which is very different from that in the (100) Si MOSFET where an

from the insulator with dR/dT<0 to the metal with dR/dT>0 occurs at a low
resistance of R_{\Box}^c \sim 0.04h/e^2. At the low-temperature transition,
which we attribute to the existence of a narrow impurity band at the interface,
a distinct hysteresis in the resistance is detected. At higher temperatures,
another change in the sign of dR/dT is seen and related to the crossover from
the degenerate to non-degenerate 2DEG.

if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program,
then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We
specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive
logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To
compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down
abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We
compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles
among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.

of Wilson loops from the string/gauge correspondence. We start with the
original calculation in $AdS_5$. It is then extended to the non-conformal
background of $D_p$ in the near horizon limit. We discuss the computation at
finite temperature. Supergravity models that admit confinement in 3d and 4d are
described. A theorem that determines the classical values of loops associated
with a generalized background is derived.In particular we determine sufficient
conditions for confining behavior. We then apply the theorem to various string
models including type 0 ones. We describe an attempt to go beyond the classical
string picture by incorporating quadratic quantum fluctuations. In particular
we address the BPS configuration of a single quark, the supersymmetric
determinant of $AdS_5\times S^$ and a setup that corresponds to a confining
gauge theory. We determine the form of the Wilson loop for actions that include
non trivial $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The issue of an exact determination of the
value of the stringy Wilson loop is discussed. We end with a brief review of
the baryons from the string/gauge correspondence Lectures presented in the
