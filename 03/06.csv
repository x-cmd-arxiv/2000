of 20 in the regions with strong Fe 6.4 keV line. This indicates that the Fe
6.4 keV line mainly arises from molecular clouds with large gas phase abundance
of refractory elements. We discuss the implications of the correlation on the

between collapsars and normal collapse-driven supernovae. They are products of
explosive nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission. In the collapsar model, it is
natural to consider that the product of explosive nucleosynthesis depends on
the zenith angle because the system becomes highly asymmetric in order to
generate a fire ball. We also consider the detectability of the HNRs which is
located nearby our Galaxy. As a result, the number of the HNRs is estimated to
be 5 $\times$ ($10^2$ -- $10^{-3}$), whose chemical composition can be
spatially resolved. Using the optimistic estimate, more HNRs will be found and
it will be possible to discuss on the chemical composition statistically. As
for the energy spectrums of neutrinos, they are not thermalized in a collapsar
because the density of the accretion disk is much lower than that of a neutron
star. The energy spectrums of (anti-)electron neutrinos from hypernovae will be
mainly determined by the process of electron (positron) capture on free proton
(neutron). It is also noted that high energy tail is not dumped in the case of
hypernovae because the density of emitting region is low. Total energy of
neutrino from hypernovae will depend on a lot of physical parameters such as
total accreting mass and mass accretion rate, which are quite contrary to the
situation of the normal collapse-driven supernovae. Therefore there will be a
large variety of total neutrino's energies among collapsars. In the case of SN
1998bw, we think that the matter around the equatorial plane might be ejected
from the system, which resulted in the formation of relatively weak jets and
faint GRB 980425.

an instantaneous burst following a Salpeter or flatter IMF, having stars more
massive that 80 Msol. The stellar cluster is able to provide most of the
ionizing photons needed to photoionize the whole nebula, and the wind power to
form the central shell structure where the cluster core is located. The stellar
cluster is affected by an extinction similar to the average extinction that
affects the ionized gas. The estimated number of massive stars in the cluster
is also in agreement with that derived from previous studies based on the
detection of individual stars. The results that we present here support the use
of these techniques for the interpretation of the integrated light of more

centered at 7700\AA, which we interpret as the K~I 7665/7699 resonance doublet.
The observed flux declines shortward of 7000\AA, due most likely to the red
wing of the Na~I doublet. Both Cs~I doublet lines are detected more strongly
than in an earlier red spectrum. Neither Li~I absorption nor H$\alpha$ emission
are detected. An exploratory model fit to the spectrum suggests that the shape
of the red spectrum can be primarily accounted for by the broad wings of the
K~I and Na~I doublets. This behavior is consistent with the argument proffered
by Burrows, Marley and Sharp that strong alkali absorption is principally
responsible for depressing T dwarf spectra shortward of 1$\mu$m. In particular,
there seems no compelling reason at this time to introduce dust or an
additional opacity source in the atmosphere of the SDSS object. The width of

of data on a significant fraction of the stellar content of our Galaxy. These
missions will require a careful optimisation of their observational systems in
order to maximise their scientific return, and will require reliable and
automated techniques for parametrizing the very large number of stars detected.
To address these two problems, I investigate the precision to which the three
principal stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [M/H]) can be determined as a
function of spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, using a large
grid of synthetic spectra. The parametrization technique is a neural network,
which is shown to provide an accurate three-dimensional physical
parametrization of stellar spectra across a wide range of parameters. It is
found that even at low resolution (50-100 AA FWHM) and SNR (5-10 per resolution
element), Teff and \met can be determined to 1% and 0.2 dex respectively across
a large range of temperatures (4000-30000 K) and metallicities (-3.0 to +1.0
dex), and that logg is measurable to +/- 0.2 dex for stars earlier than solar.
The accuracy of the results is probably limited by the finite parameter
sampling of the data grid. The ability of medium band filter systems (with
10-15 filters) for determining stellar parameters is also investigated.
Although easier to implement in a unpointed survey, it is found that they are
only competitive at higher SNRs (> 50).

that both sources have linear polarizations, if any, below the detection limits

polarization effects as has been suggested for 3C159. Refractive scintillation
may be the cause of the variability in 0235-197. This would require the
existence of a bright, compact component in one of the hot spots seen in these
observations. This is not implausible but the resolution of this observational
program is insufficent to address that question. The radio source 1203+043
lacks any bright compact component thereby ruling out a refractive
scintillation mechanism for its variability. Consequently, it is possible that
claims of variability in this source are spurious. However, the 320 MHz VLA
observations show that 1203+043 has an `X'-shaped radio structure. This is a
rare morphology for the brightness distribution of a radio galaxy; the

originating probably from the core collapse of the bare C+O cores of massive
stars ($\sim 30-40$M$_\odot$). At late times, both the light curves and the

understand the claimed connection with GRB's. The Type IIn SN 1997cy is even
more luminous than SN 1998bw and the light curve declines more slowly than

turns however out that the Wakimoto fields are not free because of the boundary
conditions and in order to have the usual mode expansion with reasonable
behaviour under complex conjugation it is necessary to consider the
complexification of AdS3 and then add some constraints. Furthermore they cover
only half AdS3 and we need different patches to cover the whole space and to
make the above mentioned transformation really canonical.

call the Frobenius-Schur functions. These functions are indexed by partitions
and differ from the conventional Schur functions in lower terms only.
  Our interest in these new functions comes from the fact that they provide an
explicit expression for the dimension of a skew Young diagram in terms of the
Frobenius coordinates. This is important for the asymptotic theory of the
characters of the symmetric groups.
  Our main result is a surprisingly simple determinantal expression of the
Frobenius-Schur functions in terms of the conventional Schur functions. Other
results include certain generating series, the Giambelli formula, vanishing
properties and interpolation, a combinatorial formula (representation in terms
of tableaux), and a Sergeev-Pragacz-type formula.
  Actually, we deal with a wider class of inhomogeneous symmetric functions
which we call multiparameter Schur functions. These functions depend on an
arbitrary doubly infinite sequence of parameters and interpolate between the
Frobenius--Schur functions and the conventional Schur functions.
  This paper contains the statements of the results and the main formulas.
Proofs will be given in an expanded version of the paper which will be posted
in the arXiv.

conjugacy implies algebraic conjugacy; similarly any measurable factor is
algebraic, and algebraic and affine centralizers provide invariants of
measurable conjugacy. Using the algebraic machinery of dual modules and
information about class numbers of algebraic number fields we consruct various
examples of Z^d-actions by Bernoulli automorphisms whose measurable orbit
structure is rigid, including actions which are weakly isomorphic but not
isomorphic. We show that the structure of the centralizer for these actions may

the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant (for example) of their $p$-fold branched

and the third a small ``separator'' set, is useful for improving the
performance of a number of combinatorial algorithms. This is done using the
second eigenvector of a matrix defined solely in terms of the incidence matrix,
called the graph Laplacian. For sparse graphs, the eigenvector can be
efficiently computed using the Lanczos algorithm. This graph partitioning
algorithm is extended to provide a complete hierarchical subdivision of the
graph. The method has been implemented and numerical results obtained both for
simple test problems and for several grid graphs.
