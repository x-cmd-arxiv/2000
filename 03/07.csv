Cluster in the IJH bands, using the UKIRT high resolution camera UFTI.
Approximately 32% of the 515 point sources detected are brown dwarf candidates,
including several free floating objects with masses below the Deuterium burning
(planetary) threshold at 0.013 solar masses, which are detectable because of
their extreme youth. We have confidence that almost all the sources detected
are cluster members, since foreground contamination is minimal in the 33
arcmin^2 area surveyed and the dense backdrop of OMC-1 obscures all background
stars at these wavelengths. Extinction is calculated from the (J-H)colours,
permitting accurate luminosity estimates and temperatures are derived from the
dereddened (I-J) colours. There is some evidence for a cut-off in the
luminosity function below the level corresponding to several Jupiter masses,
which may represent the bottom end of the IMF. Since star formation is complete
in the Trapezium this limit could have wide significance, if confirmed.
However, it could well be an effect of the dispersal of the molecular cloud by
the central O-type stars, a process whose timescale will vary between star
formation regions.

tested our implementation of the chemical and cooling processes by comparing
N-body top hat simulations with theoretical predictions from a semi-analytic

properties are insensitive to the initial abundance of molecular hydrogen. Our
main objective was to determine the minimum mass ($M_{SG}(z)$) of perturbations
that could become self gravitating (a prerequisite for star formation), and the
redshift at which this occurred. We have developed a robust indicator for
detecting the presence of a self-gravitating cloud in our simulations and find
that we can do so with a baryonic particle mass-resolution of 40 solar masses.
We have performed cosmological simulations of primordial objects and find that
the object's mass and redshift at which they become self gravitating agree well
with the $M_{SG}(z)$ results from the top hat simulations. Once a critical
molecular hydrogen fractional abundance of about 0.0005 has formed in an
object, the cooling time drops below the dynamical time at the centre of the
cloud and the gas free falls in the dark matter potential wells, becoming self
gravitating a dynamical time later.

radio-loud and 27 radio-quiet, suitable for spectral analysis. Differences are
found between the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and the radio-loud quasars (RLQs),
in agreement with previous studies. A correlation between Gamma and optical
H-beta was also found for the radio-quiet quasars in this sample, whereby the
steepest X-ray spectra tend to be found in those objects with narrow H-beta
widths. The correlation is significant at >99% confidence, confirming the
well-known trend between Gamma and H-beta FWHM in Seyfert 1s (Brandt et al.
1997), but at higher luminosities. Other spectral complexities are observed
from this sample. A soft X-ray excess, with blackbody temperatures in the range
100 - 300 eV, is seen in many low z radio-quiet quasars. In most cases the
temperatures are probably too hot to originate directly from the disk. Iron K
line emission features are also found in the RQQs; but often from partially
ionised material. Indeed in the highest luminosity RQQs there is neither
evidence for iron line emission nor the reflection component expected from disk
models. These observations can be explained by an increase in the quasar
accretion rate with luminosity, leading to an increase in the ionisation state
of the surface layers of the disk. The occurrence of ionised or `warm'
absorbers is rare in this sample, with only 5 detections. However excess
neutral X-ray absorption is found towards several of the high z, predominantly
radio-loud, quasars. Although found to increase with quasar redshift, this
`intrinsic' absorption may be associated with radio-loud AGN.

a true scale of solar convection but the combination of the effects of both

The important role played by SPDs in horizontal velocity fields appears in the
spectra of these fields where the scale $\sim$4 Mm is most energetic; we
illustrate the effect of averaging with a one-dimensional toy model which shows
how two independent non-moving (but evolving) structures can be transformed
into a single moving structure when time and space resolution are degraded.
  The role of SPDs in the formation of the photospheric network is shown by
computing the advection of floating corks by the granular flow. The coincidence
of the network bright points distribution and that of the corks is remarkable.
We conclude with the possibility that supergranulation is not a proper scale of
convection but the result of a large-scale instability of the granular flow,
which manifests itself through a correlation of the flows generated by SPDs.

(such as particle size in colloids or chain length in polymers) which takes
values in a continuous range. It therefore has an infinite number of conserved
densities, described by a density {\em distribution} $\rho(\sigma)$. The free
energy depends on all details of $\rho(\sigma)$, making the analysis of phase
equilibria in such systems intractable. However, in many (especially
mean-field) models the {\em excess} free energy only depends on a finite number
of (generalized) moments of $\rho(\sigma)$; we call these models truncatable.
We show, for these models, how to derive approximate expressions for the {\em
total} free energy which only depend on such moment densities. Our treatment
unifies and explores in detail two recent separate proposals by the authors for
the construction of such moment free energies. We show that even though the
moment free energy only depends on a finite number of density variables, it
gives the same spinodals and critical points as the original free energy and
also correctly locates the onset of phase coexistence. Results from the moment
free energy for the coexistence of two or more phases occupying comparable
volumes are only approximate, but can be refined arbitrarily by retaining
additional moment densities. Applications to Flory-Huggins theory for
length-polydisperse homopolymers, and for chemically polydisperse copolymers,
show that the moment free energy approach is computationally robust and gives
new geometrical insights into the thermodynamics of polydispersity.

dilution effect due to alloying leads to a quantum percolation problem driven
by the number of magnetically compensated moments. We argue that the exhaustion
paradox proposed by Nozi\`eres is explained when the RKKY interaction is taken
into account. We revisited the one impurity and two impurity Kondo problem and
showed that in the presence of particle-hole symmetry breaking operators the
system flows to a line of fixed points characterized by coherent motion of the
spins. This leads to a {\it cluster Kondo effect}. We calculate explicitly from
the microscopic Hamiltonian the parameters which appear in all the response
functions. We show that there is a maximum number $N_c$ of spins in the
clusters such that above this number tunneling ceases to occur. These effects
lead to a distribution of cluster Kondo temperatures which vanishes for finite
clusters and therefore leads to strong magnetic response. From these results we
propose a {\it dissipative quantum droplet model} which describes the critical
behavior of metallic magnetic systems. This model predicts that in the
paramagnetic phase there is a crossover temperature $T^*$ above which
Griffiths-McCoy like singularities with power law behavior. Below $T^*$,
however, a new regime dominated by dissipation occurs with stronger
divergences. We estimate that $T^*$ is exponentially small with $N_c$.

lowered, the rho_{ab}(T) curves show a transition from a linear behaviour to a

doping-dependent temperature T_{ch}. This effect can be interpreted as due to a
progressive pinning of preexistent charge stripes. In the same framework, the

to non-Lorentz invariant modifications of the effective space-time experienced
by the quasiparticles (``matter'') for high momenta. By introducing a
``relativistic'' conserved energy-momentum tensor, we derive quasi-equilibrium
states of the fluid across the ``Landau'' quasiparticle horizon at temperatures
well above the quantum Hawking temperature. Nonlinear dispersion of the
quasiparticle energy spectrum is instrumental for quasiparticle communication
and exchange across the horizon. It is responsible for the establishment of the
local thermal equilibrium across the horizon with the Tolman temperature being
inhomogeneous behind the horizon. The inhomogeneity causes relaxation of the
quasi-equilibrium states due to scattering of thermal quasiparticles, which
finally leads to a shrinking black hole horizon. This process serves as the
classical thermal counterpart of the quantum effect of Hawking radiation and
will allow for an observation of the properties of the horizon at temperatures
well above the Hawking temperature. We discuss the thermal entropy related to
the horizon. We find that only the first nonlinear correction to the energy
spectrum is important for the thermal properties of the horizon. They are fully
determined by an energy of order $E_{\rm Planck}(T/E_{\rm Planck})^{1/3}$,
which is well below the Planck energy scale $E_{\rm Planck}$, so that Planck
scale physics is not involved in determining thermal quantities related to the
horizon.

most interesting case of production of massive fermions in an expanding

readable analytical formulae, both for the spectra of the created fermions and
for their total energy density. Their derivation is closely related to the one
adopted for bosons and exploits the fact that the production occurs during very
short intervals of nonadiabatical change of the fermionic frequency. Our
formulae show the presence of resonance bands if the expansion of the Universe
is neglected, and their disappearance when the latter is included. As in the
bosonic case, this last effect is due to the stochastic character that the
expansion gives to the whole process. Backreaction is considered in the last
part of the work. All our analytical results are in excellent agreement with
the previous numerical ones in the regime of validity of the latter. However, a
more accurate scaling for the energy density of the produced fermions is here
found.

phase transition to a kaon-condensed phase, and whether or not Gibbs' rules for
phase equilibrium can be satisfied in the case of a first order transition,
depend sensitively on the choice of the kaon-nucleon interaction. The main
effect of finite temperature, for any value of the lepton fraction, is to mute
the effects of a first order transition, so that the thermodynamics becomes
similar to that of a second order transition. Above a critical temperature,
found to be at least 30--60 MeV depending upon the interaction, the first order
transition disappears. The phase boundaries in baryon density versus lepton
number and baryon density versus temperature planes are delineated. We find
that the thermal effects on the maximum gravitational mass of neutron stars are
as important as the effects of trapped neutrinos, in contrast to previously
studied cases in which the matter contained only nucleons or in which hyperons
and/or quark matter were considered. Kaon-condensed EOSs permit the existence
of metastable neutron stars, because the maximum mass of an initially hot,
lepton-rich protoneutron star is greater than that of a cold, deleptonized
neutron star. The large thermal effects imply that a metastable protoneutron
star's collapse to a black hole could occur much later than in previously
studied cases that allow metastable configurations.
