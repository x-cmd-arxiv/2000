elements in the ultra-metal-poor (UMP; [Fe/H] = -3.1) halo field giant star CS
22892-052. Using new high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, abundances
of more than 30 neutron-capture elements (Z>30) have been determined. Six
elements in the 40<Z<56 domain (Nb, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Cd) have been detected
for the first time in a UMP star. Abundances are also derived for three of the
heaviest stable elements (Os, Ir, and Pb). A second transition of thorium,
Th{4086}, confirms the abundance deduced from the standard Th{4019} line, and
an upper limit to the abundance of uranium is established from the absence of
the U{3859} line. As found in previous studies, the abundances of the heavier
(Z>=56) stable neutron-capture elements in CS 22892-052 match well the scaled
solar system r-process abundance distribution. From the observed Th abundance,
an average age of ~= 16 +/- 4 Gyr is derived for cs22892-052, consistent with
the lower age limit of ~= 11 Gyr derived from the upper limit on the U
abundance. The concordance of scaled solar r-process and CS 22892-052
abundances breaks down for the lighter neutron-capture elements, supporting
previous suggestions that different r-process production sites are responsible
for lighter and heavier neutron-capture elements.

atomic-state model, based on the HULLAC code, is shown to be especially
adequate for analyzing high-resolution x-ray spectra of this sort. Almost all
of the spectral lines in the 10 - 18 Angstrom wavelength range are identified.
It is shown that, for the most part, these lines can be attributed to emission
from L-shell iron ions in the Capella coronae. Possibilities for electron
temperature diagnostics using line ratios of Fe16+ are demonstrated. It is
shown that the observed iron-L spectrum can be reproduced almost entirely by
assuming a single electron temperature of kTe= 600 eV. This temperature is
consistent with both the measured fractional ion abundances of iron and with
the temperature derived from ratios of Fe16+ lines. A volume emission measure
of 1053 cm-3 is calculated for the iron L-shell emitting regions of the Capella
coronae indicating a rather small volume of 1029 cm3 for the emitting plasma if
an electron density of 1012 cm-3 is assumed.

and DB white dwarfs. They appear at sums and differences of frequencies
associated with the stellar gravity-modes. Brickhill (1992) proposed that the
combination frequencies result from mixing of the eigenmode signals as the
surface convection zone varying in depth when undergoing pulsation. This depth
changes cause time-dependent thermal impedance, which mix different harmonic
frequencies in the light curve.
  Following Brickhill's proposal, we developed analytical expressions to
describe the amplitudes and phases of these combination frequencies. The
parameters that appear in these expressions are: the depth of the stellar
convection zone when at rest, the sensitivity of this depth towards changes in
stellar effective temperature, the inclination angle of the stellar pulsation
axis with respect to the line of sight, and lastly, the spherical degrees of
the eigenmodes involved in the mixing. Adopting reasonable values for these
parameters, we apply our expressions to a DA and a DB variable white dwarf. We
find reasonable agreement between theory and observation, though some
discrepancies remain unexplained. We show that it is possible to identify the
spherical degrees of the pulsation modes using the combination frequencies.

shocking, metal enrichment, and cooling, together with dark halo formation. We
show that outflows typically strip baryonic material out of collapsing
intermediate mass halos, suppressing star formation. More massive halos can
trap the heated gas but collapse late, leading to a broad bimodal redshift
distribution, with a larger characteristic mass associated with the lower
redshift peak. This scenario accounts for the observed bell-shaped luminosity
function of early type galaxies, explains the small number of Milky Way
satellite galaxies relative to Cold Dark Matter models predictions, and
provides a possible explanation for the lack of metal poor G-dwarfs in the

Intergalactic medium heating from outflows should produce spectral distortions

integrated spectra (3615A < lambda < 5315A) for 40 late-type spiral galaxies

interactions). We quantify lopsidedness as the amplitude <A_1> of the m=1
Fourier component of the azimuthal surface brightness distribution, averaged
over a range of radii. We compare the young stellar content, quantified by
EW(H\delta_abs) and the strength of the 4000 Angstrom break (D_4000), with
lopsidedness and find a 3-4 sigma correlation between the two. We also find a
3.2 sigma correlation between EW(H\beta_emission) and lopsidedness. Using the
evolutionary population synthesis code of Bruzual & Charlot we model the
spectra as an ``underlying population'' and a superimposed ``boost population''
with the aim of constraining the fractional boost in the SFR averaged over the
past 0.5 Gyr (the characteristic lifetime of lopsidedness). From the difference
in both EW(H\delta_abs) and D_4000 between the most and least symmetric thirds
of our sample, we infer that ~ 1x10^9 M_solar of stars are formed over the
duration of a lopsided event in addition to the ``underlying'' SFH (assuming a
final galactic stellar mass of 10^10 M_solar). This corresponds to a factor of
8 increase in the SFR over the past 5x10^8 years. For the nuclear spectra, all
of the above correlations except D_4000 vs. <A_1> are weaker than for the disk,
indicating that in lopsided galaxies, the SF boost is not dominated by the

significant number of HVCs (nearly 20%) having simultaneously a velocity and a
column density gradient. These HVCs have a cometary appearance in the
position-velocity representation and are called henceforward head-tail HVCs (HT
HVCs). The head is the region with the highest column density of the HVC, while
the column density of the tail is in general much lower (by a factor of 2 - 4).
The absolute majority of the cataloged HVCs belongs to the well known HVC
complexes. With exception of the very faint HVC complex L, all HVC complexes
contain HT HVCs. The HT HVCs were analyzed statistically with respect to their
physical parameters like position, velocity (v_LSR,v_GSR), and column density.
We found a linear correlation between the fraction of HVCs having a head-tail
structure and the peak column density of the HVCs. While there is no
correlation between the fraction of HT HVCs and v_LSR, we found a dependence of
the fraction of HT HVCs and v_GSR. There is no significant correlation between
the fraction of HT HVCs and the parameters galactic longitude and latitude. The
HT HVCs may be interpreted as HVCs that are currently interacting with their
ambient medium. In the context of this model the tails represent material that
is stripped off from the HVC core. We discuss the implications of this model
for galactic and extragalactic HVCs.

exchange in biased double-layer electron and hole systems, in the absence of a
magnetic field. We use a variational Hartree-Fock-like approximation to analyze
the effects of layer separation, layer density, tunneling, and applied gate
voltages on the layer densities and on interlayer phase coherence. In agreement
with earlier work, we find that for very small layer separations and low layer
densities, an interlayer-correlated ground state possessing spontaneous
interlayer coherence (SILC) is obtained, even in the absence of interlayer
tunneling. In contrast to earlier work, we find that as a function of total
density, there exist four, rather than three, distinct noncrystalline phases
for balanced double-layer systems without interlayer tunneling. The newly
identified phase exists for a narrow range of densities and has three
components and slightly unequal layer densities, with one layer being spin
polarized, and the other unpolarized. An additional two-component phase is also
possible in the presence of sufficiently strong bias or tunneling. The
lowest-density SILC phase is the fully spin- and pseudospin-polarized
``one-component'' phase discussed by Zheng {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 55},
4506 (1997)]. We argue that this phase will produce a finite interlayer Coulomb
drag at zero temperature due to the SILC. We calculate the particle densities
in each layer as a function of the gate voltage and total particle density, and
find that interlayer exchange can reduce or prevent abrupt transfers of charge
between the two layers. We also calculate the effect of interlayer exchange on
the interlayer capacitance.

definitions (which may depend on the abducibles) which are nothing else than
standard logic programs (with their non-monotonic semantics when containing
with negation); on the other hand rules which constrain the models for the
abducibles. In this sense abductive logic programming is a smooth extension of
the standard paradigm of logic programming, not a radical departure.

the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program
in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules
are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed
into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are
respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory
correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Our approach
allows both the specification of static orderings (as found in most previous
work), in which preferences are external to a logic program, as well as
orderings on sets of rules. In large part then, we are interested in describing
a general methodology for uniformly incorporating preference information in a
logic program. Since the result of our translation is an extended logic
program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels.
To this end, we have developed a compiler, available on the web, as a front-end
for these programming systems.

introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for
selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort
involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we
characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility
ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking

produces on the 4-manifold of 2-spheres in a Riemannian 3-space a space-time
metric invariant under uniform conformal transformations of the 3-space. When
the 3-space is Euclidean, the metric reduces to de Sitter's expanding universe
metric. Generalization yields a space-time metric that retains the `exponential
expansion property' of the de Sitter metric. A strictly geometric action
principle gives field equations which, because they do not adhere to Einstein's
early confounding of energy and inertial mass with gravitating mass, admit
solutions that escape the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems. A spherically
symmetric solution that is asymptotic to the Schwarzschild blackhole metric
has, in place of a horizon and a singularity, an Einstein-Rosen `bridge', or
`tunnel', connecting two asymptotically Euclidean regions. On one side the
gravitational center attracts, and is dark but not black; on the other side it
repels, and is bright. Travel and signaling from either side to the other via
the tunnel are possible. Analysis of the Einstein tensor of this `darkhole' (or

harmless classical scalar field theory provides to violate the energy

Indeed this violation of the ANEC suggests the possible existence of
traversable wormholes supported by non-minimally coupled scalars. To
investigate this possibility we derive the classical solutions for gravity plus
a general (arbitrary xi) massless non-minimally coupled scalar field,
restricting attention to the static and spherically symmetric configurations.
Among these classical solutions we find an entire branch of traversable
wormholes for every xi>0. (This includes and generalizes the case of conformal

regarding scalar fields in modern theoretical physics. We emphasize that these

compatible with all known experimental constraints from both particle physics

particular, an evolution equation for the trace of the extrinsic-curvature

resolution of a three-dimensional elliptic operator P of Laplace type.
Interestingly, all nonlinearities of the original equations give rise to the
potential term in P. An example of this construction is given in the case of a
closed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Eventually, the ADM
equations are re-expressed as a coupled first-order system for the induced

clarifies how a set of first-order differential operators and their inverses,
jointly with spectral resolutions of operators of Laplace type, contribute to
solving, at least in principle, the original ADM system.

significant effects of lepton flavor violation may appear rather through
slepton mixing, which is in the present case generated by radiative corrections

leptons, the supersymmetric contributions are rather suppressed due to the
approximate U(1)_e X U(1)_mu. It is, however, remarkable that they are
substantially enhanced by tan^6 beta. Then, B(mu -> e gamma) might be
comparable to the experimental bound for large tan beta. In the model with the

continue to Lorentzian signature. We find that the CFT strongly suppresses

independently of how the de Sitter geometry arises, i.e., it is also true for
four dimensional Einstein gravity. Since generic matter would be expected to
behave like a CFT on small scales, our results suggest that tensor

there are phenomenological difficulties in this class of models. In fact, there
is no graviton zero-mode in this case and 4D gravity is obtained by means of
continuum bulk modes. These modes have additional degrees of freedom which do
not decouple at low energies and lead to inconsistent predictions for light
bending and the precession of Mercury's perihelion. In a recent papers,
[hep-th/0003020] and [hep-th/0003045] the authors made use of brane bending in
order to cancel the unwanted physical polarization of gravitons. In this note
we point out that this mechanism does not solve the problem since it uses a
{\it ghost} which cancels the extra degrees of freedom. In order to have a
consistent model the ghost should be eliminated. As soon as this is done, 4D
gravity becomes unconventional and contradicts General Relativity. New
mechanisms are needed to cure these models. We also comment on the possible
decoupling of the ghost at large distances due to an apparent flat-5D nature of
space-time and on the link between the presence of ghosts and the violation of
positive-energy conditions.

which may hold at the level of the full quantum theory of gravity. We find that
only the weak forms, which constrain the information available to observers on
boundaries, are implied by arguments using the generalized second law. The
strong forms, which go further and posit a bound on the entropy in spacelike
regions bounded by surfaces, are found to suffer from serious problems, which
give rise to counterexamples already at the semiclassical level. The null form,
proposed by Fischler, Susskind, Bousso and others, in which the bound is on the
entropy of certain null surfaces, appears adequate at the level of a bound on
the entropy of matter in a single background spacetime, but attempts to include
the gravitational degrees of freedom encounter serious difficulties. Only the
weak form seems capable of holding in the full quantum theory.
  The conclusion is that the holographic principle is not a relationship
between two independent sets of concepts: bulk theories and measures of
geometry vrs boundary theories and measures of information. Instead, it is the
assertion that in a fundamental theory the first set of concepts must be
completely reduced to the second.

excitation energy of the quasiprojectile. We relate this slope dependence at a
given excitation energy to the temperature of the fragmenting system. Using the
model assumptions of the statistical multifragmentation model, a method of
temperature determination is proposed. A caloric curve is constructed and
compared to the result of double isotope ratio method for the same set of data
and to the results of other studies.

approach based on the use of dispersion relations in a formalism obeying
unitarity. The basic framework is presented, including an application to
Compton scattering. In the approach the effects of the non-pole contribution
arising from pion dressing are expressed in terms of (half-off-shell) form
factors and the nucleon self-energy. These quantities are constructed through
the application of dispersion integrals to the pole contribution of loop
diagrams, the same as those included in the calculation of the amplitudes
through a K-matrix formalism. The prescription of minimal substitution is used
to restore gauge invariance. The resulting relativistic-covariant model
combines constraints from unitarity, causality, and crossing symmetry.

calculated along some isotopic chains (O, Ca, Sn) and they are compared with

mean field predictions is similar to that of some Skyrme forces while the
relativistic Hartree-Fock approach leads to a very different dependence due to
the strong non-locality.

SU(3) states. They can also be classified as rotational bands built on
spin-1$\hbar$ phonon excitations, which may correspond to a geometrical
scissors mode and its generalizations. This work is a direct demonstration that
numerical angular momentum projection theory extends the Elliott's original

measure the ionospheric parameters inside and outside the auroral arcs. The ion
line radar experiment was optimised to probe the E-region and lower F-region
with as high a speed as possible. Two extra channels were used for the plasma
line measurements covering the same altitudes, giving a total of 3 upshifted
and 3 downshifted frequency bands of 25 kHz each. For most of the time the
shifted channels were tuned to 3 (both), 4 (up), 5.5 (down) and 6.5 (both) MHz.
Weak signals are seen whenever the radar is probing the diffuse aurora,
corresponding to the relatively low plasma frequencies. At times when auroral
arcs pass the radar beam, significant increases in return power are observed.
Many cases with simultaneously up and down shifted plasma lines are recorded.
In spite of the rather active environment, the highly optimised measurements
enable investigation of the properties of the plasma lines. A modified
theoretical incoherent scatter spectrum is used to explain the measurements.
The general trend is an upgoing field-aligned current in the diffuse aurora,
confirmed with a full fit of the combined ion and plasma line spectra. There
are also cases with strong suprathermal currents indicated by large differences
in signal strength between up- and downshifted plasma lines.

  Phys. Letters","Found. Phys. Lett. 13 (2000) 427-442",,,"quant-ph",,"  Relativistic causality, namely, the impossibility of signaling at
superluminal speeds, restricts the kinds of correlations which can occur
between different parts of a composite physical system. Here we establish the
basic restrictions which relativistic causality imposes on the joint
probabilities involved in an experiment of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm
type. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, places further restrictions beyond
those required by general considerations like causality and consistency. We
illustrate this fact by considering the sum of correlations involved in the
CHSH inequality. Within the general framework of the CHSH inequality, we also
consider the nonlocality theorem derived by Hardy, and discuss the constraints
that relativistic causality, on the one hand, and quantum mechanics, on the
other hand, impose on it. Finally, we derive a simple inequality which can be
used to test quantum mechanics against general probabilistic theories.

established that the spectral region where the quadrature fluctuations are

that the frequency at which suppression of the fluctuation is greatest can be
controlled by adjusting the phase of the initial coherent light pulse. The
spectral correlation function of photons is introduced and photon antibunching
is found.

of controlling the coherent as well as the decoherent dynamics of a two-level
atom placed in a lossy cavity.
  The control of the coherent dynamics is elucidated for the phenomenon of
coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT), i.e., the coherent dynamics of a
driven two-level atom in a quantum superposition state can be brought
practically to a complete standstill. We study this phenomenon for different
initial preparations of the two-level atom. We then proceed to investigate the
decoherence originating from the interaction of the two-level atom with a lossy
cavity mode. The loss mechanism is described in terms of a microscopic model
that couples the cavity mode to a bath of harmonic field modes. A suitably
tuned external cw-laser field applied to the two-level atom slows down
considerably the decoherence of the atom. We demonstrate the suppression of
decoherence for two opposite initial preparations of the atomic state: a
quantum superposition state as well as the ground state. These findings can be
used to the effect of a proficient battling of decoherence in qubit
manipulation processes.
