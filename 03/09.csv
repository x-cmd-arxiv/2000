as well as emission line properties. The observed peculiar properties of the
NLS1s are believed to be due to accretion rate close to Eddington limit. As a
consequence, for a given luminosity,
  NLS1s have smaller black hole (BH) masses compared to normal Seyfert
galaxies. Here we argue that NLS1s might be Seyfert galaxies in their early
stage of evolution and as such may be low redshift, low luminosity analogues of
high redshift quasars. We propose that NLS1s may reside in rejuvenated, gas
rich galaxies. We also argue in favor of collisional ionization for production
of FeII in active galactic nuclei (AGN).

performance of the $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator has been recently questioned,
especially for the faint-end estimation of the LF. We improved these estimators
for the studies of the distant Universe, and examined their performances for
various classes of functional forms by Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied
these estimation methods to the mock 2dF redshift survey catalog prepared by
Cole et al. (1998). We found that $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator yields a completely
unbiased result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against
clusters or voids. This is consistent with the well-known results, and we did
not confirm the bias trend of $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator claimed by Willmer
(1997) in the case of homogeneous sample. We also found that the other three
maximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent results
with each other. In practice we recommend Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator for two
reasons: 1. it simultaneously provides the shape and normalization of the LF;
2. it is the fastest among these four estimators, because of the algorithmic
simplicity. Then, we analyzed the photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep
Field prepared by Fern\'{a}ndez-Soto et al. (1999) using the above four
methods. We also derived luminosity density $\rho_{\rm L}$ at $B$- and

spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized prescription of the main
features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of
HII regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the
influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of
radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of
continuum radiation in the HII regions and the subsequent transfer of line and
continuum radiation in the surrounding HI regions and the ambient ISM. This
enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneous
sample of nearby UV-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-IR
to UV luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha
equivalent width, and the UV spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime
of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancy
between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In
addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to
lambda^-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-IR to UV
luminosities and the UV spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply
as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow
wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the
steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In
particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical
depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation
of all the observations. Our model for absorption can be incorporated easily
into any population synthesis model. (abridged)

these predictions when using a non-standard theory of Gravity. We study
examples of cosmologies that do not necessarily obey Einstein's field
equations: scalar-tensor theories (STT), such as Brans-Dicke (BD), parametrized
with $\omega$, a non-standard parametrisation of the Hubble law, $H^2=
a^{-3(1+\epsilon)}$, or a non-standard cosmic equation of state $p=\gamma\rho$,

$\gamma$, $\omega$ and $\epsilon$ from observations of the skewness and
kurtosis in the APM Galaxy Survey. This test is independent of the overall
normalization of rms fluctuations. We also show how abundances and formation

  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The classical [CO] index, i.e. the strength of the CO first overtone
absorption bands starting at 2.29 micron, is sometimes used to constrain the
maximum age of star formation events in galaxies. In this paper we critically
analyze
  - theoretical models which could predict either a factor of >2 drop or a
pronounced increase of [CO] at ages older than 100 Myr, depending on the
evolutionary tracks one adopts
  - observational data for young clusters in the LMC which do not show any
strong relationship between the CO index and cluster age.
  The above scenario indicates that the value of [CO] does not provide a
reliable tool for estimating the age of stellar populations older than about 10
Myr, i.e. after the first red supergiants have been formed.
  The contradictory results of theoretical models reflect problems in treating
the evolution along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). In particular, those
evolutionary synthesis models using stellar tracks which do not include the
thermal pulsing AGB phase produce too weak CO features at 100-1000 Myr, i.e. in
the range of ages when the near infrared emission is dominated by thermal
pulsing AGB stars.

(unsynchronized) and synchronized states of the oscillator population. Assuming
a Lorentzian distribution of oscillator natural frequencies, $g(\Omega)$, both
larger inertia or larger frequency spread stabilize the incoherent solution,
thereby making harder to synchronize the population. In the limiting case
$g(\Omega)=\delta(\Omega)$, the critical coupling becomes independent of
inertia. A richer phenomenology is found for bimodal distributions. For
instance, inertial effects may destabilize incoherence, giving rise to
bifurcating synchronized standing wave states. Inertia tends to harden the
bifurcation from incoherence to synchronized states: at zero inertia, this
bifurcation is supercritical (soft), but it tends to become subcritical (hard)
as inertia increases. Nonlinear stability is investigated in the limit of high

SNeBR then makes the user decide what belief to remove from the belief space in

SNeBR, by which, under certain circumstances, SNeBR decides by itself which
belief to remove, and then informs the user of the decision and its
consequences. We have used the well-known belief revision integrity constraints
as a guide in designing automatic belief revision, taking into account,

be infeasible to form the deductive closure in order to decide what belief to

isometrically embedded into a four-dimensional reference spacetime. This
virtually eliminates the embeddability problem inherent in the use of a
three-dimensional reference space, but introduces a new one: such embeddings
are not unique, leading to an ambiguity in the reference IQE. However, in this
codimension-two setting there are two curvatures associated with S: the
curvatures of its tangent and normal bundles. Taking advantage of this fact, I
will suggest a possible way to resolve the embedding ambiguity, which at the
same time will be seen to incorporate angular momentum into the energy at the
quasilocal level. I will analyze the IQE in the following cases: both the
spatial and future null infinity limits of a large sphere in asymptotically
flat spacetimes; a small sphere shrinking toward a point along either spatial
or null directions; and finally, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.
The last case reveals a striking similarity between the reference IQE and a
certain counterterm energy recently proposed in the context of the conjectured
AdS/CFT correspondence.

Within the considered parameter space, the enhancement to the ratio $BR(b \to s

the model III (II), while the ratio $BR(b \to no charm)$ can be increased from
the standard model prediction of 2.49% to 4.91% (2.99%) in the model III (II).
Consequently, the value of $B_{SL}$ and $n_c$ can be decreased simultaneously
in the model III. The central value of $B_{SL}$ will be lowered slightly by
about 0.003, but the ratio $n_c$ can be reduced significantly from the

theory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons
coupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self
duality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features
of such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration
may be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave
propagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein
compactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no
causality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher
dimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the
compactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the
scattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular
momentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged
interactions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometry
is used. Therefore, the `repulson' behaviour previously found is universal for
non accelerated observers; 3) The solutions are shown to have a non-standard
gyromagnetic ratio of $g=3$. In contrast, the superpartners of a static, BPS,
five dimensional black hole have $g=1$. At the semi-classical level, we find
that a Dirac fermion propagating in the rotating hole background has $g=2\pm1$,
depending on the spinor direction of the fermion being parallel to Killing or
`anti-Killing' spinors.

compactifications where the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant is

renormalization effects due to standard-model fields renormalize the 3-brane
tension, which changes a deficit angle in the transverse space without
affecting local quantities in the bulk. For a compactification scale of order

useful to observe backward reflected DR from an circular aperture or slit
inclined with respect to the beam velocity. However, up to now, well founded

Specific devices will be discussed which perform all the necessary operations
for quantum computing, with an emphasis placed on the qualitative principles
underlying their operation.
  The likely impediments to achieving large-scale quantum computation using
this architecture will be addressed: the computer must operate at extremely low
temperature, must be fabricated from devices built with near atomic precision,
and will require extremely accurate gating operations in order to perform
quantum logic. Refinements to the computer architecture will be presented which
could remedy each of these deficiencies. I will conclude by discussing a
specific realization of the computer using Si/SiGe heterostructures into which
donors are deposited using a low energy focused ion beam.

system with an environment is introduced. Such semigroups lead to the selection
of a stable subalgebra of effective observables. The structure of this
subalgebra is completely determined.

state just before the measurement to the system state just after the
measurement conditional upon the outcome of measurement. This paper determines
all the possible conditional state changes caused by measurements of
nondegenerate discrete observables. For this purpose, the following conditions
are shown to be equivalent for measurements of nondegenerate discrete
observables: (i) The joint probability distribution of the outcomes of
successive measurements depends affinely on the initial state. (ii) The
apparatus has an indirect measurement model. (iii) The state change is
described by a positive superoperator valued measure. (iv) The state change is
described by a completely positive superoperator valued measure. (v) The output
state is independent of the input state and the family of output states can be
arbitrarily chosen by the choice of the apparatus. The implications to the
measurement problem are discussed briefly.
