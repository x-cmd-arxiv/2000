hydrogen were recorded by the Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile
Spectrograph (IMAPS) at a wavelength resolving power R=80,000 in the spectra of
delta Ori and epsilon Ori. The objective was to find and study more examples of
an unusual phenomenon found for one of the velocity components of H2 in the
spectrum of zeta Ori by Jenkins & Peimbert (1997). Specifically, they detected
a gradual shift in velocity and broadening for features arising from
progressively higher rotational excitations J. This effect appears to be absent
in the spectra of both delta and epsilon Ori, which are only a few degrees away
in the sky from zeta Ori. The absence of atomic material at a large negative
velocity in the spectra of delta and epsilon Ori (and its presence in zeta Ori)
supports a proposal by Jenkins & Peimbert that the line of sight to zeta
intercepts a bow shock facing away from us, perhaps created by the collision of
wind-like material with some foreground obstruction. For both stars, the H2
absorption features are separated into two velocity components. Total H2 column
densities toward delta and epsilon Ori are 5.5e14 and 1.9e16 cm^-2,
respectively. The rotation temperatures of the molecules with J > 2 toward
epsilon Ori indicate that the gas is in the general vicinity of the stars that
emit UV fluxes capable of rotationally pumping the molecules. For the strongest
component of H2 toward delta Ori, the pumping rate is lower and consistent with
a general UV flux level in the plane of the Galaxy.

large component of galaxy surveys, both imaging and spectroscopy. The Hubble
Deep Field datasets include the deepest observations ever made in the
ultraviolet, optical and near infrared, reaching depths comparable to that
expected for NGST spectroscopy. We present the source counts, galaxy sizes and
isophotal filling factors of the HDF-South images. The observed integrated
galaxy counts reach >500 galaxies per square arcminute at AB<30. We extend
these counts to faint levels in the infrared using models. The trend previously
seen that fainter galaxies are smaller, continues to AB=29 in the high
resolution HDF-S STIS image, where galaxies have a typical half-light radius of
0.1 arcseconds. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the small measured
sizes are not due to selection effects until >29mag. Using the HDF-S NICMOS
image, we show that galaxies are smaller in the near infrared than they are in
the optical. We analyze the isophotal filling factor of the HDF-S STIS image,
and show that this image is mostly empty sky even at the limits of galaxy
detection, a conclusion we expect to hold true for NGST spectroscopy. At the
surface brightness limits expected for NGST imaging, however, about a quarter
of the sky is occupied by the outer isophotes of AB<30 galaxies. We discuss the
implications of these data on several design concepts of the NGST near-infrared
spectrograph. We compare the effects of resolution and the confusion limit of
various designs, as well as the multiplexing advantages of either multi-object
or full-field spectroscopy. We argue that the optimal choice for NGST
spectroscopy of high redshift galaxies is a multi-object spectrograph (MOS)
with target selection by a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) device.

(SNe Ia) have led to the use of SNe Ia as a ``standard candle'' to determine
cosmological parameters. Whether a statistically significant value of the
cosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminosities
of SNe Ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic
evolutions.
  Here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the Chandrasekhar
mass white dwarf (WD) models of SNe Ia. We identify the progenitor's evolution
and population with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS
(near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In these channels, the strong wind
from accreting WDs plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicity
effects on the evolution.
  We then address the questions whether the nature of SNe Ia depends
systematically on environmental properties such as metallicity and age of the
progenitor system and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We
suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O WD (or
the variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of
SNe Ia. This model can explain the observed dependences of SNe Ia brightness on
the galaxy types and the distance from the galactic center.
  Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia
progenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a
composite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

the afterglow of GRB 991216, taken from 1 to 80 days after the burst. The
optical and X-ray afterglow of this burst were fairly typical and are explained
by a jet fireball. In contrast, the radio light curve is unusual in two
respects: (a) the radio light curve does not show the usual rise to maximum
flux on timescales of weeks and instead appears to be declining already on day
1 and (b) the power law indices show significant steepening from the radio
through the X-ray bands. We show that the standard fireball model, in which the
afterglow is from a forward shock, is unable to account for (b) and we conclude
that the bulk of the radio emission must arise from a different source. We
consider two models, neither of which can be ruled out with the existing data.
In the first (conventional) model, the early radio emission is attributed to
emission from the reverse shock as in the case of GRB 990123. We predict that
the prompt optical emission would have been as bright (or brighter) than 8th
magnitude. In the second (exotic) model, the radio emission originates from the
forward shock of an isotropically energetic fireball (10^54 erg) expanding into
a tenuous medium (10^-4 cm^-3). The resulting fireball would remain
relativistic for months and is potentially resolvable with VLBI techniques.
Finally, we note that the near-IR bump of the afterglow is similar to that seen
in GRB 971214 and no fireball model can explain this bump.

QPO fundamental and harmonic frequencies observed in some Galactic black-hole
candidates. We assume that the accretion flow exhibits a transition from an
outer cool, optically thick accretion disk to a hot, inner advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF), and that the QPOs are related to small-scale
oscillations of the accretion rate and the transition radius. We present an
analytical estimate of the expected phase lags at the fundamental and first
harmonic frequencies of the QPOs and perform detailed time-dependent
Monte-Carlo simualtions of the radiation transport in the oscillating ADAF /
cool disk system. We find that this model is well suited to reproduce
alternating phase lags between the fundamental and the first harmonic. It also
naturally explains the trend observed in GRS 1915+105 that, as the soft X-ray
luminosity increases, the QPO frequency increases and the phase lag associated
with the QPO fundamental frequency changes sign from positive to negative. The
relation between the disk temperature and the QPO frequency observed in GRS
1915+105 is consistent with a secular instability modulating the disk
evaporation at the transition radius.

cause strong coupling in the derived abundances of various elements. The
abundance determination is also difficult due to the uncertainties in the Fe-L
atomic physics, because Fe-L lines couple with O and Ne K-lines. However, when
abundances of $\alpha$-elements are fixed, all the plasma codes give similar Fe
abundances with a scattering of only 20-30%. To relax the strong coupling among
the elements, we included 20% systematic errors in the Fe-L region of the
spectra. Then, in X-ray luminous galaxies, the derived abundance of Fe and
$\alpha$-elements both became $\sim 1$ solar within a factor of 2. This result
relaxes the previous severe discrepancy between the ISM and stellar
metallicities. The ISM metallicity in X-ray fainter galaxies is still
uncertain, but we can at least constrain that contribution from type-Ia SN to
the ISM abundance is lower than in X-ray luminous systems. These results
strongly suggest that a large fraction of SN Ia products have escaped into
intergalactic space.

interferometer. This has allowed diffraction-limited imaging of a large number
of bright astrophysical targets, including the geometrically complex dust
envelopes around a number of evolved stars. The successful restoration of these
images, with dynamic ranges in excess of 200:1, highlights the significant
capabilities of sparse aperture imaging as compared with more conventional
filled-pupil speckle imaging for the class of bright targets considered here.
In particular the enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the Fourier data,
precipitated by the reduction in atmospheric noise, allows high fidelity
imaging of complex sources with small numbers of short-exposure images relative
to speckle. Multi-epoch measurements confirm the reliability of this imaging
technique and our whole dataset provides a powerful demonstration of the

using connection formulas at every turning point. A general formula for the

in Prolog. Two ways have been explored to resolve these problems: loop checking
and tabling. Loop checking can cut infinite loops, but it cannot be both sound
and complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling seems to be an
effective way to resolve infinite loops and redundant computations. However,
existing tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and
Tabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the
solution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of
non-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple
stack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly
sequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve infinite loops and
redundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to
establish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has
two distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations in the same
way as Prolog except that infinite loops are broken and redundant computations
are reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and
complete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property. The
underlying algorithm can be implemented by an extension to any existing Prolog
abstract machines such as WAM or ATOAM.

actions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language
E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We
define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called
the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe
plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for
cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based
upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural
proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this
proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts
argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We
provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in
particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.

Interestingly, all these solutions predict the correct amount of CP violation

expresses the subleading HQET form factor $\xi_3$ or, in other notations,
  $a_+^{(1)}$ in terms of the infinite mass limit form factors and some level

derivation of the Voloshin sum rule. From independent results on $\xi_3$ we
derive a sum rule which involves only the $\tau_{1/2}^{(n)}$ and
$\tau_{3/2}^{(n)}$ form factors and the corresponding level splittings. The

asymptotic regime of large values of parton density. We derive the AGL equation
for running coupling constant and obtain the asymptotic solution, demonstrating
that the property of partial saturation of the solution of the AGL equation is
not modified by the running of the coupling constant. We show that in this
kinematical regime, the solution of the AGL equation coincides with the
solution of an evolution equation, obtained recently using the
McLerran-Venugopalan approach. Using the asymptotic behavior of the gluon
distribution we calculate the $F_2$ structure function assuming first that the
leading twist relation between these two quantities is valid and second that
this relation is modified by the higher twist terms associated to the unitarity
corrections. In the first case we obtain that the corresponding $F_2$ structure
function is linearly proportional to $ln s$, which agrees with the results
obtained recently by Kovchegov using a distinct approach. In the second case a
softer behavior is obtained. In both cases, the $F_2$ structure function
unitarizes and the Froissart boundary is not violated in the asymptotic regime
of high density QCD. We conclude that the partial saturation of the gluon
distribution and the unitarization of the structure function are general
results, well-established by three distinct approaches for high dense systems.

gravity. The 5D effective theory at large scales follows from a holographic
renormalization group flow. As intuitively expected, the graviton is
effectively four dimensional at intermediate scales and becomes five
dimensional at large scales. However in the holographic effective theory the
essentially 4D radion dominates at long distances and gives rise to scalar
anti-gravity. The holographic description shows that at large distances the GRS
model is equivalent to the model recently proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and
Porrati (DGP), where a tensionless brane is embedded into 5D Minkowski space,
with an additional induced 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane. In the
holographic description the radion of the GRS model is automatically localized
on the tensionless brane, and provides the ghost-like field necessary to cancel
the extra graviton polarization of the DGP model. Thus, there is a holographic
duality between these theories. This analysis provides physical insight into
how the GRS model works at intermediate scales; in particular it sheds light on
the size of the width of the graviton resonance, and also demonstrates how the
holographic RG can be used as a practical tool for calculations.

propose that the condition 0 < Z < 1 [wherever proven] can be rigorously

mass scale Lambda that can be determined from this condition. We derive the
nonlocal analogue of the above relation [which is a finite relation in NLQFT]
and demonstrate that it can be arrived at only from general principles. We
further propose that the nonlocal formulation should be looked as an effective
field theory that incorporates the effect of dynamics beyond an energy scale

it should be replaced by another [perhaps, a more fundamental] theory. We
provide a heuristic justification for this view-point.

quasiperiodic (QP) pattern in convection and similar nonlinear dissipative
systems where a direct generation of stable uniform QP planforms is not
possible. An {\it eightfold} QP pattern can be created as a broad transient
layer between two domains filled by square cells (SC) oriented under the angle
of 45 degrees relative to each other. A simplest particular type of the
transient layer is considered in detail. The structure of the pattern is
described in terms of a system of coupled real Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations,
which are solved by means of combined numerical and analytical methods. It is
found that the transient ``quasicrystallic'' pattern exists exactly in a
parametric region in which the uniform SC pattern is stable. In fact, the
transient layer consists of two different sublayers, with a narrow additional
one between them. The width of one sublayer (which locally looks like the
eightfold QP pattern) is large, while the other sublayer (that seems like a
pattern having a quasiperiodicity only in one spatial direction) has a width
$\sim 1$. Similarly, a broad stripe of a {\it % twelvefold} QP pattern can be
generated as a transient region between two domains of hexagonal cells oriented
at the angle of 30 degrees.

naturally to the notion of generalized flows which are families of probability
distributions on the space of solutions to the associated ODEs, which no longer
satisfy the uniqueness theorem for ODEs. Two most natural regularizations of
this problem, namely the regularization via adding small molecular diffusion
and the regularization via smoothing out the velocity field are considered.
White-in-time random velocity fields are used as an example to examine the
variety of phenomena that take place when the velocity field is not spatially
regular. Three different regimes characterized by their degrees of
compressibility are isolated in the parameter space. In the regime of
intermediate compressibility, the two different regularizations give rise to
two different scaling behavior for the structure functions of the passive
scalar. Physically this means that the scaling depends on Prandtl number. In
the other two regimes the two different regularizations give rise to the same
generalized flows even though the sense of convergence can be very different.
The ``one force, one solution'' principle and the existence and uniqueness of
an invariant measure are established for the scalar field in the weakly
compressible regime, and for the difference of the scalar in the strongly
compressible regime.

a strong first harmonic in their azimuthal dependence. The strength of this
oscillation characterizes the tilt of the major axis of the spatial emission
ellipsoid away from the direction of the beam. Event generator studies indicate
that this tilt can be large (>20 degrees) at AGS energies which makes it by far
the most significant azimuthally sensitive HBT signal at these energies.
Moreover, transport models suggest that for pions this spatial tilt is directed
opposite to the tilt of the directed flow ellipsoid in momentum space. A
measurement of the azimuthal dependence of the HBT cross terms $R_{ol}^2$ and
$R_{sl}^2$ thus probes directly the physical origin of directed pion flow.

a molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the
composite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary
particles and hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with only four
known constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring,
the mass of electron, the mass of Z=B0, and the fine structure constant for the
magnetic field. The calculated masses are in good agreement with the observed
