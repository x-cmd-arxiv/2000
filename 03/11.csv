addition to this power law component, a second nonthermal component already
detected by ASCA could be present in the X-ray spectrum of the cluster, not
surprisingly given the complex radio morphology of the cluster central region.
The spectral index of the hard tail detected by the PDS onboard BeppoSAX is
marginally consistent with that expected by the inverse Compton model. A value
of ~0.05 microG is derived for the intracluster magnetic field of the extended

to undetected mixing that must exist somewhere to explain why oceanic scalar
fields like temperature and salinity are so well mixed, just as the dark matter
paradox of galaxies refers to undetected matter that must exist to explain why
rotating galaxies don't fly apart by centrifugal forces. Both paradoxes result
from sampling techniques that fail to account for the extreme intermittency of

range of scales; turbulent vorticity for dark mixing, and accreting
small-planetary-mass MACHO number density for dark matter.

501 (Mrk 501), taken with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in 1998 May as part
of a multi-wavelength campaign. The X-ray light curve shows a very rapid flare
in which the 2-10 keV flux increased by ~60% in <200 seconds. This rapid rise
is followed by a drop-off in the 2-10 keV flux of ~40% in <600 seconds. The
10-15 keV variation in this flare is roughly a factor of two on similar
time-scales. During the rise of the flare, the 3-15 keV spectral index hardened
from 2.02 +/- 0.03 to 1.87 +/- 0.04, where it remained during the decay of the
flare. This is the fastest variation ever seen in X-rays from Mrk 501 and among
the fastest seen at any wavelength for this object. The shift in the energy at
which the spectral power peaks (from <3 keV before the flare to >30 keV during
the flare) is also among the most rapid shifts seen from this object. This
flare occurs during an emission state (2-10 keV flux approximately 1.2e-10 erg
cm^-2 s^-1) that is approximately 25% of the peak flux observed in 1997 April
from this object but which is still high compared to its historical average
X-ray flux. The variations in the hardness ratio are consistent with the low
energy variations leading those at high energies during the development and
decay of the flare. This pattern is rare among high frequency peaked BL Lac
objects like Mrk 501, but has been seen recently in two other TeV emitting BL
Lacs, Mrk 421 and PKS 2155-304. The hard lag is consistent with a flare
dominated by the acceleration time-scale for a simple relativistic shock model
of flaring.

that tides alone are not responsible for the irregular appearance of the

interaction between gaseous components. These results extend the results of

Wigner crystals of hole pairs, orbital antiferromagnets (or staggered-flux

the vicinity of second-order quantum phase transitions between the states, we
go beyond the large-N limit by identifying the universal quantum field theories
for the critical points, and computing the finite temperature, quantum-critical
damping of fermion spectral functions. We identify candidate critical points
for the recently observed quantum-critical behavior in photoemission
experiments on BSCCO by Valla et al. (Science 285, 2110 (1999)). These involve
onset of a charge density wave, or of broken time-reversal symmetry with (d+id)
or (s+id) pairing, in a d-wave superconductor. It is not required (although it
is allowed) that the stable state in the doped cuprates to be anything other
than the d-wave superconductor--the other states need only be stable nearby in
parameter space. At finite temperatures, fluctuations associated with these
nearby states lead to the observed fermion damping in the vicinity of the nodal
points in the Brillouin zone. The cases with broken time-reversal symmetry are
appealing because the order parameter is not required to satisfy any special
commensurability conditions. The observed absence of inelastic damping of
quasiparticles with momenta (pi,k), (k,pi) (with 0 < k < pi) also appears very
naturally for the case of a transition to (d+id) order.

unstable state come in two classes: pulled and pushed. ``Pulled'' fronts are
``pulled along'' by the spreading of linear perturbations about the unstable
state, so their asymptotic speed $v^*$ equals the spreading speed of linear
perturbations of the unstable state. The central result of this paper is that
the velocity of pulled fronts converges universally for time $t\to\infty$ like
$v(t)=v^*-3/(2\lambda^*t) + (3\sqrt{\pi}/2)
D\lambda^*/(D{\lambda^*}^2t)^{3/2}+O(1/t^2)$. The parameters $v^*$,
$\lambda^*$, and $D$ are determined through a saddle point analysis from the
equation of motion linearized about the unstable invaded state. The interior of
the front is essentially slaved to the leading edge, and we derive a simple,
explicit and universal expression for its relaxation towards
$\phi(x,t)=\Phi^*(x-v^*t)$. Our result, which can be viewed as a general center
manifold result for pulled front propagation, is derived in detail for the well
known nonlinear F-KPP diffusion equation, and extended to much more general
(sets of) equations (p.d.e.'s, difference equations, integro-differential
equations etc.). Our universal result for pulled fronts thus implies
independence (i) of the level curve which is used to track the front position,
(ii) of the precise nonlinearities, (iii) of the precise form of the linear
operators, and (iv) of the precise initial conditions. Our simulations confirm
all our analytical predictions in every detail. A consequence of the slow
algebraic relaxation is the breakdown of various perturbative schemes due to
the absence of adiabatic decoupling.

convergence of solvability type integrals. We point out that these conditions
are not satisfied for pulled fronts propagating into an unstable state: their
relaxation on the inner scale is power law like and in conjunction with this,
solvability integrals diverge. The physical origin of this is traced to the
fact that the important dynamics of pulled fronts occurs in the leading edge of
the front rather than in the nonlinear internal front region itself. As recent
work on the relaxation and stochastic behavior of pulled fronts suggests, when
such fronts are coupled to other fields or to noise, the dynamical behavior is
often qualitatively different from the standard case in which fronts between

Informally, in revising K by A, we begin with A and incorporate as much of K as
consistently possible. Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are
expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a
maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as
consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a
single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended
by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state;
alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.
  The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express
other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and
the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework
differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect
to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for
implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results
than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite
knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those
propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.

functions have exact representations in terms of light-cone Fock state
wavefunctions of bound states such as hadrons. We illustrate all of these
properties by giving explicit light-cone wavefunctions for the two-particle
Fock state of the electron in QED, thus connecting the Schwinger anomalous
magnetic moment to the spin and orbital momentum carried by its Fock state
constituents. We also compute the QED one-loop radiative corrections for the
form factors for the graviton coupling to the electron and photon. Although the
underlying model is derived from elementary QED perturbative couplings, it in
fact can be used to simulate much more general bound state systems by applying
spectral integration over the constituent masses while preserving all of the
Lorentz properties, giving explicit realization of the spin sum rules and other
local matrix elements. The role of orbital angular momentum in understanding
the ""spin crisis"" problem for relativistic systems is clarified. We also prove
that the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment B(0) vanishes for any composite
system. This property is shown to follow directly from the Lorentz boost
properties of the light-cone Fock representation and holds separately for each
Fock state component. We show how the QED perturbative structure can be used to
model bound state systems while preserving all Lorentz properties. We thus
obtain a theoretical laboratory to test the consistency of formulae which have
been proposed to probe the spin structure of hadrons.

G(KN\Sigma) coupling constants by including the contributions from higher
dimensional condensates, <\bar{q} g_s \sigma \cdot G q> and <\bar{q}q>
<(\alpha_s /\pi) G^2>, in the OPE. It is found that the contribution of these
condensates is non-negligible compared to that of the quark condensates. Using
a best-fit analysis we find |G(KN\Lambda)| = 2.49 $\pm$ 1.25 and |G(KN\Sigma)|
= 0.395 $\pm$ 0.377.

operator of an open system. Successive terms of those expansions yield
characteristic loss rates for dissipation processes. Three applications are
presented in order to give further insight into the context of those
expansions. The first application, of a two-level atom coupling to a bosonic
environment, shows the procedure and the advantage of the expansion, whereas
the second application that consists of a single mode field in a cavity with
linewidth $\kappa$ due to partial transmission through one mirror illustrates a
practical use of those expansions in quantum measurements, and the third one,
for an atom coupled to modes of a lossy cavity shows the another use of the
perturbative expansion.
