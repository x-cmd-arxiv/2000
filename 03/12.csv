detected two large shells in the interstellar neutral hydrogen near l=279 deg.
The center velocities are +36 and +59 km/s, which puts the shells at kinematic
distances of 7 and 10 kpc. The larger shell is about 610 pc in diameter and
very empty, with density contrast of at least 15 between the middle and the
shell walls. It has expansion velocity of about 20 km/s and swept up mass of
several million solar masses. The energy indicated by the expansion may be as
high as 2.4 X 10^53 ergs. We estimate its age to be 15 to 20 million years. The
smaller shell has diameter of about 400 pc, expansion velocity about 10 km/s
and swept up mass of about 10^6 solar masses.
  Morphologically both regions appear to be shells, with high density regions
mostly surrounding the voids, although the first appears to have channels of
low density which connect with the halo above and below the HI layer. They lie
on the edge of the Carina arm, which suggests that they may be expanding
horizontally into the interarm region as well as vertically out of the disk. If
this interpretation is correct, this is the first detection of an HI chimney
which has blown out of both sides of the disk.

briefly revise the basic ideas of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) as a tool
to understand structure formation, in particular through the study of higher
order statistics, like the skewness and the 3-point function. Contrary to what
happens with the second order statistics (the variance or power-spectrum), this
test of gravitational instability is independent of the overall amplitude of
fluctuations and of cosmic evolution, so that it does not require comparing the
clustering at different redshifts. Predictions from weakly non-linear PT have
been compared with observations to place constraints on our assumptions about
structure formation, the initial conditions and how galaxies trace the mass.

represent a significant computational resource---one that is, however, also
unreliable, heterogeneous, and opportunistic. This type of resource has been
used effectively for embarrassingly parallel problems but not for more tightly
coupled problems. We describe an algorithm that allows branch-and-bound
problems to be solved in such environments. In designing this algorithm, we
faced two challenges: (1) scalability, to effectively exploit the variably
sized pools of resources available, and (2) fault tolerance, to ensure the
reliability of services. We achieve scalability through a fully decentralized
algorithm, by using a membership protocol for managing dynamically available
resources. However, this fully decentralized design makes achieving reliability
even more challenging. We guarantee fault tolerance in the sense that the loss
of up to all but one resource will not affect the quality of the solution. For
propagating information efficiently, we use epidemic communication for both the
membership protocol and the fault-tolerance mechanism. We have developed a
simulation framework that allows us to evaluate design alternatives. Results
obtained in this framework suggest that our techniques can execute scalably and
reliably.

shown that the conformal invariance in 5D is broken by taking an absolute
cosmological scale $R_0$ over which the 4D metric is assumed to be dependent
weakly on the 5th dimension. This is equivalent to Deser's model for the
breakdown of the conformal invariance in 4D by taking a constant cosmological
mass term $\mu^2\sim R_0^{-2}$ in the theory. We set the scalar field to its
background cosmological value leading to Einstein equation with the
gravitational constant $G_N$ and a small cosmological constant. A dual Einstein
equation is also introduced in which the matter is coupled to the higher
dimensional geometry by the coupling $G_N^{-1}$. Relevant interpretations of
the results are also discussed.
