  conference series, A. Lancon & C.M. Boily, eds",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The duration of starbursts is important for determining how they are
regulated and the impact they have on their environment. Starbursts contain
numerous prominent star clusters which typically comprise in total ~20% of the
ultraviolet light, embedded in a diffuse glow of recently formed stars
responsible for the dominant ~80%. Hubble Space Telescope images have been
obtained for four starburst galaxies in order to determine their burst duration
from the ages of their star clusters. Preliminary results for NGC3310 are
reported here. The UBI colors of its clusters and diffuse light give consistent
results. The clusters have a broad range of colors, consistent with a
population of instantaneous bursts with ages ranging from 0 to a few 100 Myr.
The diffuse light has a narrow range of color consistent with continuous star
formation over timescales ranging from ~ 10 to 100 Myr. Hence NGC3310's
starburst has lasted ~100 Myr, or about 10 times the crossing time. Other
results noted in the literature also indicate bursts lasting several times
longer than the crossing time. These results suggest that starbursts are not
self-extinguishing flashes. Rather they are sustainable, perhaps
self-regulated.

distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute
gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the
special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary
conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code
uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this
with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET
thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time.
So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5e7
particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation,
high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well
as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail

gravity-modes. We demonstrate that parametric instability, a form of resonant
3-mode coupling, limits overstable modes to amplitudes similar to those
observed. In particular, it reproduces the observed trend that longer period
modes have larger amplitudes. Parametric instability involves the
destabilization of a pair of stable daughter modes by an overstable parent
mode. The 3-modes must satisfy exact angular selection rules and approximate
frequency resonance. The lowest instability threshold for each parent mode is
provided by the daughter pair that minimizes
$(\delta\omega^2+\gamma_d^2)/\kappa^2$, where $\kappa$ is the nonlinear
coupling constant, $\delta\omega$ is the frequency mismatch, and $\gamma_d$ is
the energy damping rate of the daughter modes. The overstable mode's amplitude
is maintained at close to the instability threshold value.
  Although parametric instability defines an upper envelope for the amplitudes
of overstable modes in ZZ Ceti stars, other nonlinear mechanisms are required
to account for the irregular distribution of amplitudes of similar modes and
the non-detection of modes with periods longer than $1,200\s$. Resonant 3-mode
interactions involving more than one excited mode may account for the former.
Our leading candidate for the latter is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the
mode-driven shear layer below the convection zone.

rates of production and destruction of 18F is required to study 18F synthesis

plasma medium at the origin of the iron Kalpha fluorescent line. The physical
parameters and the location of the so-called Warm Absorber (WA), a photoionized

constrained by optical coronal lines than by the oxygen edges observed in the

  Accepted by A&A Main Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  High resolution near-infrared adaptive optics imaging and polarimetry have
been obtained of the Homunculus Nebula and its central star Eta Carinae (HD
93308). Maps of the linear polarization at a resolution of <0.2'' have been
made in the J, H and K bands and in a narrow 2.15micron continuum band (K_c).
The overall appearance of the nebula in the near-IR is similar in all bands and
to that at V, with specific features less sharp to longer wavelengths. The
large-scale pattern of polarization vectors is centro-symmetric demonstrating
that single scattering dominates everywhere except perhaps in the central
bright core. Polarization maps at K_c in the near vicinity of Eta Carinae were
restored using a PSF derived from blind deconvolution. An extension of the flux
in the direction of the optically visible speckle knots was detected, with 18%
polarization determined for one knot.
  The most remarkable result of the linear polarization mapping is the level of
similarity in the spatial structure, and the degree of polarization, between
the near-IR and optical data. Such a polarization pattern cannot arise in Mie
scattering from a single power law distribution of grain sizes unless the
particles are very small compared with the wavelength, in disagreement with
mid-IR observations. The colour dependence of the extinction was found to be
shallower than the typical ISM, indicating the presence of large grains.
Optical depth effects and a broad distribution in grain sizes are suggested to
explain these contradictory results, perhaps with a dependence of the grain
size with depth into the small obscuring clouds in the Homunculus lobes.
However the presence of aligned grains, previously inferred from mid-IR
polarization, may also affect the dust-scattered radiation. (Abridged abstract)

generalisations of the Dehnen potential which have been proposed to model
ellipticals with a strong density cusp that manifest significant deviations
from axisymmetry. Allowance is made for a possible supermassive black hole, as
well as low amplitude friction, noise, and periodic driving which can mimic
irregularities associated with discreteness effects and/or an external
environment. The degree of chaos is quantified by determining how (1) the
relative number of chaotic orbits and (2) the size of the largest Lyapunov
exponent depend on the steepness of the cusp and the black hole mass, and (3)
the extent to which Arnold webs significantly impede phase space transport,
both with and without perturbations. In the absence of irregularities, chaotic
orbits tend to be extremely `sticky,' so that different pieces of the same
chaotic orbit can behave very differently for 10000 dynamical times or longer,
but even very low amplitude perturbations can prove efficient in erasing many
-- albeit not all -- these differences. The implications thereof are discussed
both for the structure and evolution of real galaxies and for the possibility
of constructing approximate near-equilibrium models using Schwarzschild's
method. Much of the observed qualitative behaviour can be reproduced with a toy
potential given as the sum of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator and a

show properties consistent with a Fermi liquid description at low temperatures.
The effective masses extracted from the temperature dependence of the magnetic

suggesting that these systems are strongly correlated. However, the ratio
m^*_c/m_e contains both the renormalization due to the electron-electron
interaction and the periodic potential of the lattice. We show that for any
quasi-two-dimensional band structure, the cyclotron mass is proportional to the
density of states at the Fermi energy. Due to Luttinger's theorem, this result
is also valid in the presence of interactions. We then evaluate m_c for several
model band structures for the \beta, \kappa, and \theta families of
(BEDT-TTF)_2X, where BEDT-TTF is bis-(ethylenedithia-tetrathiafulvalene) and X
is an anion. We find that for \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2X, the cyclotron mass of the

the effective mass of the \alpha- orbit. This result is fairly insensitive to
the band structure details. For a wide range of materials we compare values of

the interacting quarter-filled band there are two transitions: first, a similar

atomic range. The key properties of the Coulomb dynamics are: (i) a peculiar
mixed-type phase space with sparse families of stable non-ionizing orbits and
(ii) scale-invariance symmetry, with all orbits defined by an arbitrary scale
parameter. The combination of this peculiar chaotic dynamics ((i) and (ii)),
with the scale-dependent relativistic corrections (Darwin interaction)
generates the phenomenon of scale-dependent stability: We find numerical
evidence that stable non-ionizing orbits can exist only for a discrete set of
resonant energies. The Fourier transform of these non-ionizing orbits is a set
of sharp frequencies. The energies and sharp frequencies of the non-ionizing
orbits we study are in the quantum atomic range.

the ratio approaches the rigorous lower bound $R=2/3$. We also present results

as the $UV_{14}$ potential plus the three-nucleon interaction are considered in
the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian. The electron and muon are treated
relativistically in the total Hamiltonian at given temperature, to make the
fluid electrically neutral and stable against beta decay. The calculation is
performed for a wide range of baryon density and temperature which are of
interest in the astrophysics. The free energy, entropy, proton abundance, etc.
of nuclear beta-stable matter are calculated.
  It is shown that by increasing the temperature, the maximum proton abundance
is pushed to the lower density while the maximum itself increases as we
increase the temperature. The proton fraction is not enough to see any
gas-liquid phase transition. Finally we get an overall agreement with other
many-body techniques, which are available only at zero temperature.

choose the experimental arrangement so as to admit an interpretation as a joint
non-ideal measurement yielding interference and ``which-way'' information.
Comparison of the different measurements gives insight into the question of
which information is provided by a (generalized) quantum mechanical
measurement. For this purpose the subspaces of Hilbert-Schmidt space, spanned
by the operators of the POVM, are determined for different measurement
arrangements and different values of the parameters.
