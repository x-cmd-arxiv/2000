binary GX 3+1, we found a single short and strong X-ray burst. This is the
first burst from GX 3+1 which clearly shows evidence for radius expansion of
the neutron-star photosphere during the thermo-nuclear runaway. We show that
the cooling phase of the neutron star photosphere starts already just before
the end of the contraction phase. Considering the fact that the radius
expansion is due to the burst luminosity being at the Eddington luminosity,
assuming standard burst parameters and accounting for gravitational redshift
effects we derive a distance to the source of ~4.5 kpc, although relaxing these
assumptions may lead to uncertainties up to ~30%. By comparing the persistent
flux with that observed at the peak of the burst we infer that near the time of
the X-ray burst the persistent luminosity of GX 3+1 is ~0.17*L_edd, confirming
predictions from theoretical modeling of X-ray spectra of bright sources like
GX 3+1.

the universe, through its interaction with the spacetime geometry. The tension
of the field lines means that the magneto-curvature coupling tends to
accelerate positively curved regions and decelerate those with negative
curvature. Depending on the equation of state of the matter, the effect varies
from mimicking that of a cosmological constant to resembling a time-decaying
quintessence. Most interestingly, the coupling between magnetism and geometry
implies that even weak fields have a significant impact if the curvature
contribution is strong. This leads to kinematical complications that can
inhibit the onset of the accelerated phase in spatially open inflationary
models. We employ a simple cosmological model to illustrate these effects and
examine the conditions necessary for them to have a appreciable impact.

retards its otherwise inexorable contraction from a more extended configuration

employing an identical selection procedure, the BCS extension is compiled from

at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 20 deg). It comprises 100 X-ray selected
clusters of galaxies with measured redshifts z < 0.3 (as well as seven more at

cm-2 s-1 in the 0.1-2.4 keV band (the latter value being the flux limit of the
original BCS). The extension can be combined with the main sample published in
1998 to form the homogeneously selected extended BCS (eBCS), the largest and
statistically best understood cluster sample to emerge from the ROSAT All-Sky
Survey to date.
  The nominal completeness of the combined sample (defined with respect to a
power law fit to the bright end of the BCS log N-log S distribution) is
relatively low at 75 per cent (compared to 90 per cent for the high-flux sample
of Paper I). However, just as for the original BCS, this incompleteness can be
accurately quantified, and thus statistically corrected for, as a function of
X-ray luminosity and redshift.
  In addition to its importance for improved statistical studies of the
properties of clusters in the local Universe, the low-flux extension of the BCS
is also intended to serve as a finding list for X-ray bright clusters in the

cluster observations with the next generation of X-ray telescopes such as

realized in the large doping regime. This new phase should be viewed as a doped
version of the microscopically insulating x = 1/8 stripes. The topological
excitations associated with the extra doping are fractionally charged kinks
along the stripes whose motions make the stripe fluctuate. We argue that the
directional degree of freedom of the kinks might order, causing the stripe
phase to tilt. Quantitative predictions follow for the doping dependence of the
tilt angle, which in turn can be used to determine the fundamental charge

as failure is a modal operator. In an alternative view, a logic program is
interpreted as a definition. In this view, negation as failure is classical

fixed in such a way that the correct known location of the leading infrared

field equations in d+2 dimensions. It is shown that the field theory formalism
goes well beyond Dirac's goal of linearizing conformal symmetry. In accord with
recent results in the worldline approach of two-time physics, the d+2 field
theory can be brought down to diverse d dimensional field theories by solving
the subset of field equations that correspond to the ``kinematic'' constraints.
This process embeds the one ``time'' in d-dimensions in different ways inside
the d+2 dimensional spacetime. Thus, the two-time d+2 field theory appears as a
more fundamental theory from which many one-time d dimensional field theories
are derived. It is suggested that the hidden symmetries and relations among
computed quantities in certain d-dimensional interacting field theories can be
taken as the evidence for the presence of a higher unifying structure in a d+2
dimensional spacetime. These phenomena have similarities with ideas such as
dualities, AdS-CFT correspondence and holography.

  Firstly, the work of Brown and Heyworth which extends rewriting techniques to
enable the computation of left Kan extensions over the category of sets. It is
well known that left Kan extensions can be defined over categories other than
Sets.
  Secondly, the `folklore' that rewriting theory is a special case of
noncommutative Groebner basis theory. It is therefore natural to ask whether
Groebner bases can provide a method for computing Kan extensions beyond the
special case of rewriting.
  To answer this question completely, fully exploiting the computational power
of Groebner basis techniques relating to Kan extensions is the ultimate aim.
This paper provides a first step by showing how standard noncommutative
Groebner basis procedures can be used to calculate left Kan extensions of
K-category actions. In the final section of the paper a number of interesting

of fluctuations around 1.1 MeV, 460 keV and 125 keV for an excitation energy

isoscalar monopole, dipole, and high-energy octupole resonances. We employ a
consistent formalism that uses the same interaction in the calculation of the
ground state as in the calculation of the response. As a result, the
conservation of the vector current is strictly maintained throughout the
calculation. Further, at small momentum transfers the spurious dipole
strength-associated with the uniform translation of the center-of-mass-gets
shifted to zero excitation energy and is cleanly separated from the sole
remaining physical fragment located at an excitation energy of about 24 MeV; no
additional dipole strength is observed. The best description of the collective
modes is obtained using a ``soft'' parameterization having a compression
modulus of K=224 MeV.

within the modified quark-meson coupling model (MQMC) by adding repulsive
scalar and vector quark-quark interactions. Without these correlations, the bag
radius increases with the baryon density. However when the correlations are
introduced the bag size shrinks as the bags overlap. Also as the strength of
the scalar quark-quark correlation is increased, the decrease of the effective
nucleon mass $M^{*}_N$ with the baryonic density is slowed down and tends to
saturate at high densities. Within this model we study the phase transition
from the baryon-meson phase to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase with the
latter modeled as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons inside a bag. Two models
for the QGP bag parameter are considered. In one case, the bag is taken to be
medium-independent and the phase transition from the hadron phase to QGP is
found to occur at 5-8 times ordinary nuclear matter density for temperatures
less than 60 MeV. For lower densities, the transition takes place at higher
temperature reaching up to 130 MeV at zero density. In the second case, the QGP
bag parameter is considered medium-dependent as in the MQMC model for the
hadronic phase. In this case, it is found that the phase transition occurs at
much lower densities.

An additional mathematical apparatus is needed for the transition from a pure
