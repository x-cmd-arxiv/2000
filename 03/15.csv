  velocity structures?","10 pages, 11 figures, revised version, to be published in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the viability of the unification of BL Lacs and FR I radio
galaxies by comparing the core emission of radio galaxies with those of BL Lacs
of similar extended radio power, taking advantage of the newly measured optical
nuclear luminosity of FR I sources. The spectral properties of complete samples
are also studied in the radio-optical luminosity plane: starting from the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of BL Lacs, we calculate the predicted
luminosity of FR I nuclei in the frame of a simple one--zone model, by properly
taking into account the relativistic transformations. We find that the bulk
Lorentz factors required by the spread in the observed luminosities in all
bands are significantly smaller than those implied by other, both observational
and theoretical, considerations. This discrepancy is also reflected in the fact
that FR I nuclei are over-luminous by a factor of 10-10^4, with respect to the
predictions, both in the radio and in the optical band.
  In order to reconcile these results with the unification scheme, velocity
structures in the jet are suggested, where a fast spine is surrounded by a slow
(but still relativistic) layer so that the emission at different angles is
dominated by different velocity components: the fast one dominates the emission
in BL Lacs while the slow layer dominates the emission in misaligned objects.
Furthermore for the lowest luminosity BL Lacs it has to be also postulated that
their beaming factor in the radio band is lower than in the optical (and
X-ray), as would result from deceleration of the jet.
  The self-consistency of the unification model therefore requires that both
intrinsic differences in the SED and different beaming properties play a
substantial role in characterizing the phenomenology of these sources.

was performed using stellar IDs; the calibration does not agree with the
pre-flight estimates, probably due to effects of detector hysteresis and
photometric aperture correction. The 6.7um extragalactic counts are broadly
reproduced in the Pearson & Rowan-Robinson model, but the Franceschini et al.
(1997) model underpredicts the observed source density by ~0.5-1 dex, though
the photometry at 6.7um is still preliminary. At 15um the extragalactic counts

The counts agree with other estimates from the ISOCAM instrument at overlapping
flux densities (Elbaz et al. 1999), provided a consistent flux calibration is
used. Luminosity evolution at a rate of (1+z)^3, incorporating mid-IR spectral
features, provides a better fit to the 15um differential counts than (1+z)^4

disks, which would have had a mass comparable to that of the inner dark halo
and be plausibly non-axisymmetric, and of massive galactic winds, which at
early times may have carried off as many baryons as a galaxy now contains. A
host of observational phenomena, from quasar absorption lines and intracluster
gas through the G-dwarf problem point to the existence of such winds. Dynamical
interactions will homogenize and smooth the inner halo, and the observed disk
will be the relic of a massive outflow. The inner halo expanded after absorbing
energy and angular momentum from the ejected material. Observed disks formed at
the very end of the galaxy formation process, after the halo had been reduced
to a minor contributor to the central mass budget and strong radial streaming

the hydrodynamical properties of Red Supergiant (RSG) stars at solar chemical
composition and for stellar masses ranging from 10 to 20 M_sun. We find that

temperature, and indeed when moving from higher to lower effective temperatures
the models show an increase in the dynamical perturbations. Also, we find that
RSGs are pulsationally unstable for a substantial portion of their lifetimes.
These dynamical instabilities play a key role in driving mass loss, thus
inducing high mass loss rates (up to several 1e-4 M_sun/yr) and considerable
variations of the mass loss activity over timescales of the order of 10,000

temperature profile and abundances of Mg, Si and Fe for six galaxies. The
temperature profiles are consistent with isothermal temperatures outside of a
cooler region at the galaxy center. We present new evidence for iron abundance
gradients in NGC4472 and NGC4649 and confirm the previous results on NGC4636.
Mg and Si abundance gradients on average are flatter compared to those of iron
and correspond to an underabundance of alpha-process elements at high Fe
values, while at low iron, the element ratios favor enrichment by type II SNe.
We explain the observed trend by the metallicity dependence of SN Ia metal
production and present constraints on the available theoretical modeling for
low-metallicity inhibition of SNe Ia (Kobayashi et al. 1998). Our results imply
a cut-off metallicity in the range 0.07-0.3 solar and require a lower limit of
0.3 solar on the Fe contribution of SN Ia. We estimate an SN Ia rate at the
centers of the brightest galaxies in our sample of ~0.08 (h_75)^3 SNu
(supernova units). The rates inferred from optical searches should be corrected
for the presence of `faint' SN Ia events, since these release limited metals
and therefore do not contribute significantly to the measured metallicity in
the X-ray gas. With this correction the present-epoch SN Ia rate in early-type
galaxies is 0.10+/-0.06 (h_75)^2 SNu (Cappellaro et al. 1997) and is therefore

lower than test-particle, Rankine-Hugoniot relations predict. Furthermore, the
heating of the gas to X-ray emitting temperatures is strongly coupled to the
acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons and ions, thus nonlinear processes which
modify the shock, influence the emission over the entire band from radio to
gamma-rays and may have a strong impact on X-ray line models. Here we apply an
algebraic model of nonlinear acceleration, combined with SNR evolution, to
model the radio and X-ray continuum of Kepler's SNR.

time-honored observations in cosmology. In this Letter, we focus on some
statistical properties of these counts which are fundamental in order to
characterize the large scale correlations in the galaxy spatial distribution.
There are, in fact, no longer doubts since two decades of the existence of very
large scale structures. The still remaining problem concerns the correct
characterization of their statistical properties. We propose to study two
properties of galaxy counts data, in order to discriminate between a small
scale (~ 5 - 20 Mpc/h) homogeneous distribution, and a fractal structure on
large scales (~ 20 - 300 Mpc/h). Firstly, the average slope of the counts which
can be associated to an eventual fractal dimension in real space by simple
arguments. Secondly, we propose to study fluctuations of counts around the
average behavior as a function of apparent magnitude in the whole magnitude
range B_j > 11. These fluctuations can discriminate between a genuine fractal
distribution and a homogeneous one. In fact, they are related to the very
statistical properties of the spatial distribution, independently on
cosmological corrections. More specifically, in a fractal distribution one
expects to find persistent scale-invariant fluctuations around the average
behavior, which do not decay with apparent magnitude. On the other hand, in an
homogeneous distribution, on large enough scales, the relative variance of the
counts should decrease exponentially with apparent magnitude. Smooth
cosmological corrections cannot change such a behavior.

energy functional $\cal F$, with a mobility given by the Einstein relation
Beside a regularity condition on J, the only requirement for this result is
that the reference system satisfy the hypotheses of the Varadhan--Yau Theorem
leading to the equation for $J\equiv 0$. Therefore the equation holds also if
$\cal F$ achieves its minimum on non constant density profiles and this
includes the cases in which {\sl phase segregation} occurs. Using the same
techniques we also derive hydrodynamic equations for the densities of a two
component A-B mixture with long range repulsive interactions between A and B
particles. The equations for the densities $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$ are again in
the form of the gradient flux. They describe, at low temperatures, the demixing
transition in which segregation takes place via vacancies, i.e. jumps to empty
sites. In the limit of very few vacancies the problem becomes similar to phase
segregation in a continuum system in the so called incompressible limit.

antiferromagnetic exchange couplings depending on tunneling amplitudes and

  in ACM Transactions on Computational Logic",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL",,"  Logical frameworks based on intuitionistic or linear logics with higher-type
quantification have been successfully used to give high-level, modular, and
formal specifications of many important judgments in the area of programming
languages and inference systems. Given such specifications, it is natural to
consider proving properties about the specified systems in the framework: for
example, given the specification of evaluation for a functional programming
language, prove that the language is deterministic or that evaluation preserves
types. One challenge in developing a framework for such reasoning is that
higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), an elegant and declarative treatment of
object-level abstraction and substitution, is difficult to treat in proofs
involving induction. In this paper, we present a meta-logic that can be used to
reason about judgments coded using HOAS; this meta-logic is an extension of a
simple intuitionistic logic that admits higher-order quantification over simply
typed lambda-terms (key ingredients for HOAS) as well as induction and a notion
of definition. We explore the difficulties of formal meta-theoretic analysis of
HOAS encodings by considering encodings of intuitionistic and linear logics,
and formally derive the admissibility of cut for important subsets of these
logics. We then propose an approach to avoid the apparent tradeoff between the
benefits of higher-order abstract syntax and the ability to analyze the
resulting encodings. We illustrate this approach through examples involving the
simple functional and imperative programming languages PCF and PCF:=. We
formally derive such properties as unicity of typing, subject reduction,
determinacy of evaluation, and the equivalence of transition semantics and
natural semantics presentations of evaluation.

their endpoints, a control over this region. This region is affected both by
non-perturbative phenomena related to the Fermi motion of the heavy quark and
by perturbative soft gluon radiation in the final state (Sudakov form
factor).Fermi motion can be described by the shape function f (m*), which
represents the distribution of the effective mass m* of the heavy quark at
disintegration time. We perform a factorization with a simple technique in
order to consistently separate perturbative from non-perturbative effects. We
find that the shape function, contrary to naive expectations,is not a physical
distribution, as it is affected by substantial regularization scheme effects,
controlling even the leading, double-logarithmic term. It factorizes, however,
the bulk of non-perturbative effects in lattice-like regularizations. Some
non-perturbative effects are present in the coefficient function even at
leading twist, but they are expected to be suppressed on physical grounds.

as a second class constrained surface in the fibre bundle ${{\mathcal

bundle equipped with a natural symplectic structure. The second class system is
converted into the first class one by continuation of the constraints into the
extended manifold, being a direct sum of ${{\mathcal T}^*_\rho}{\mathcal M}$
and the tangent bundle $T {\mathcal M}$. This extended manifold is equipped
with a nontrivial Poisson bracket which naturally involves two basic
ingredients of Fedosov geometry: the symplectic structure and the symplectic
connection. The constructed first class constrained theory, being equivalent to
the original symplectic manifold, is quantized through the BFV-BRST procedure.
The existence theorem is proven for the quantum BRST charge and the quantum
BRST invariant observables. The adjoint action of the quantum BRST charge is
identified with the Abelian Fedosov connection while any observable, being
proven to be a unique BRST invariant continuation for the values defined in the
original symplectic manifold, is identified with the Fedosov flat section of
the Weyl bundle. The Fedosov fibrewise star multiplication is thus recognized

Theory analogs of elliptic operators where KMS functionals play the role of the

holomorphic dimension formula and prove an analogue of the index theorem in the
Quantum Field Theory context. The analytic index is the Jones index, more
precisely the minimal dimension, and, on a 4-dimensional spacetime, the DHR
theorem gives the integrality of the index. We introduce the notion of
holomorphic dimension; the geometric dimension is then defined as the part of
the holomorphic dimension which is symmetric under charge conjugation. We apply
the AHKT theory of chemical potential and we extend it to the low dimensional
case, by using conformal field theory. Concerning Quantum Field Theory on
curved spacetime, the geometry of the manifold enters in the expression for the
dimension. If a quantum black hole is described by a spacetime with bifurcate
Killing horizon and sectors are localizable on the horizon, the logarithm of
the holomorphic dimension is proportional to the incremental free energy, due
to the addition of the charge, and to the inverse temperature, hence to the
surface gravity in the Hartle-Hawking KMS state. For this analysis we consider
a conformal net obtained by restricting the field to the horizon
(``holography''). Compared with our previous work on Rindler spacetime, this
result differs inasmuch as it concerns true black hole spacetimes, like the
Schwarzschild-Kruskal manifold, and pertains to the entropy of the black hole
itself, rather than of the outside system. An outlook concerns a possible
relation with supersymmetry and noncommutative geometry.

methane is studied by wave packet simulations of oriented CH4 and CD4 molecules
from a flat surface. All nine internal vibrations are included. In the
translational energy range from 32 up to 128 kJ/mol we find that initial
vibrational excitations enhance the transfer of translational energy towards
vibrational energy and increase the accessibility of the entrance channel for
dissociation. Our simulations predict that initial vibrational excitations of
the asymmetrical stretch (nu_3) and especially the symmetrical stretch (nu_1)
modes will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probability of
methane.

entropy. Given two density matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ on a finite dimensional
Hilbert space and with $S(\rho)=-\tr\rho\ln\rho$ being the usual von Neumann
entropy, this quantity $S(\rho|\sigma)$ is concave in $\rho$ and satisfies
$0\le S(\rho|\sigma)\le S(\rho)$, a quantum analogue of Shannon's famous
inequality. Thus we view $S(\rho|\sigma)$ as the entropy of $\rho$ conditioned
by $\sigma$.

show that Berry's geometrical phase remains unaltered by the two dissipation

modulus of the Bloch's vector, which characterizes coherence loss and a time
dependent (dissipation related) precession angle. We show that the line
broadening of the Fourier transformation of the components of magnetization is
only due to the presence of dissipation.

SPIE 4047, 36-47 (2000)","10.1117/12.391966",,"quant-ph cond-mat physics.atom-ph",,"  We review results of a recently developed model of a microscopic quantum
system interacting with the macroscopic world components which are modeled by
collections of bosonic modes. The interaction is via a general operator
$\Lambda$ of the system, coupled to the creation and annihilation operators of
the environment modes. We assume that in the process of a nearly instantaneous
quantum measurement, the function of the environment involves two distinct
parts: the pointer and the bath. Interaction of the system with the bath leads
to decoherence such that the system and the pointer both evolve into a
statistical mixture state described by the density matrix such that the system
is in one of the eigenstates of $\Lambda$ with the correct quantum mechanical
probability, whereas the expectation values of pointer operators retain
amplified information on that eigenstate. We argue that this process represents
the initial step of a quantum measurement. Calculation of the elements of the
reduced density matrix of the system and pointer is carried out exactly, and
time dependence of decoherence is identified. We discuss general implications
of our model of energy-conserving coupling to a heat bath for processes of
adiabatic quantum decoherence. We also evaluate changes in the expectation
values of certain pointer operators and suggest that these can be interpreted
as macroscopic indicators of the measurement outcome.

storage times of about one minute have been achieved. We have also prepared
atoms in a certain hyperfine state and demonstrated the feasibility of a
state-selective detection via resonance fluorescence at the level of a few

distortion and without providing any information about that state. However,
quantum teleportation of continuous electromagnetic field variables introduces
additional noise, limiting the fidelity of the quantum state transfer. In this
article, the operator describing the quantum state transfer is derived. The
transfer operator modifies the probability amplitudes of the quantum state in a
shifted photon number base by enhancing low photon numbers and suppressing high
photon numbers. This modification of the statistical weight corresponds to a
measurement of finite resolution performed on the original quantum state. The
limited fidelity of quantum teleportation is thus shown to be a direct
consequence of the information obtained in the measurement.
