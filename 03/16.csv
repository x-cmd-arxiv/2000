photometric evolution model incorporating a detailed metallicity depen dent set

decreasing global star formation rate (SFR) ending at a present-day gas

some galaxies small amplitude star formation bursts are required to explain the

stochastic manner.
  The presence of an old stellar population in many late-type LSB galaxies

LSB galaxies do not form late, nor have a delayed onset of star formation, but
simply evolve slowly.

maximum-likelihood technique to fit for the relationship between the density

populations: ``fast bursts'' occur on the Banana Branch when the accretion rate
is high and exhibit short decay times, high peak fluxes, and radius expansion
episodes. ``Slow bursts'' occur in the Island State at lower accretion rates,
have lower peak fluxes, higher fluences, longer decay times, and show no
evidence of radius expansion. All five of the fast bursts, and none of the four
slow bursts, show coherent oscillations near 524 Hz.
  We perform in-burst phase connection of the burst pulsations, which allows us
to unambiguously characterize their frequency evolution. That evolution
exhibits a variety of behaviors, including a sharp spin-down during one burst.
Applying our phase models, we find that the pulsations are spectrally harder
than the burst emission, with the strength of the pulsations increasing
monotonically with photon energy. Coherently summing all of the burst signals,
we find upper limits of ~5% relative to the strength of the main pulse on any
modulation at 1/2 or 3/2 the main pulse frequency. We discuss our results in
the context of models in which the burst pulsations are produced by a hot spot
on the surface of a spinning neutron star.

produce the same traffic states, which also qualitatively agree with empirical
traffic observations. Moreover, the phase diagrams of traffic states in the
presence of bottlenecks for the microscopic car-following model and the
macroscopic gas-kinetic-based model almost agree. In both cases, we found
metastable regimes, spatially coexistent states, and a small region of
tristability. The distinction of different types of vehicles (cars and long
vehicles) yields additional insight and allows to reproduce empirical data even
more realistically, including the observed fluctuation properties of traffic
flows like the wide scattering of congested traffic data.
  Finally, as an alternative to the gas-kinetic approach, we propose a new
scheme for deriving non-local macroscopic traffic models from given microscopic
car-following models. Assuming identical (macroscopic) initial and boundary

$T=T_c>0$. The low temperature glass phase has a non trivial structure, being
dominated by {\it a few} distant states (with replica symmetry breaking
phenomenology). In finite dimension this transition exists only in this
``marginal glass'' case (energy fluctuation exponent $\theta=0$) and disappears
if correlations grow faster (single ground state dominance $\theta>0$) or
slower (high temperature phase). The associated extremal statistics problem for
correlated energy landscapes exhibits universal features which we describe
using a non linear (KPP) RG equation. These include the tails of the
distribution of the minimal energy (or free energy) and the finite size
corrections which are universal. The glass transition is closely related to
Derrida's random energy models. In $d=2$ the glass transition of the particle
exhibits interesting similarities with the weak to strong coupling transition
in Liouville ($c=1$ barrier) and with a transition that we conjecture for the
sinh-Gordon model. Glassy freezing of the particle is associated with the
generation under RG of new local operators and of non-smooth configurations in
Liouville. Applications to Dirac fermions in random magnetic fields at

coding of wavelet image decomposition coefficients succeed only because typical
images being compressed possess a significant degree of self-similarity.
Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly
related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to
another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.
  The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in
regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and
similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically
related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly
transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove
that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the
root of a zerotree, or its branch.
  The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients
as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of
a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This
interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression
techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view
predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer
prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).

  but looks okay in black and white",,,,"cs.CR",,"  In this dissertation, we present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints
on Objects, a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs
and present a method for enforcing policies so expressed. Other approaches for
stating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to
either policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may
be expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable
properties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many
different systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail,
user friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal
reasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs
annotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy
applies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse
applications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems,
distributed systems, and networks.
  Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for
implementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of
the system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO
for Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to
facilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a
network as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large
networks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that
enable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of
precisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and
implementing it on a system.

specific change of units, the derivation of asymptotic expansions becomes
straightforward. Two hypotheses could be made as to which time variable has to

accounts to most part of the hadronic structure, there is a few percent
contributions coming from the nonperturbative sector in the hadronic structure.
This contribution plays the key role in explaining the SU(2) symmetry breaking
of the nucleon sea and the observed violation of Gottfried sum rule. These
effects are calculated. Excellent agreement with data in a wide range of
$x=[10^{-6}, 1]$ and $Q^{2}=[0.5, 5000]$ $GeV^{2}$ is reached for proton
structure function. We have also calculated Pion structure and compared it with
the existing data. Again nice agreement is achieved.

still vanishes, and implies the masslessness of the pion fields at one-loop.

  Let f be a smooth transverse immersion S^3 into S^5. Then the
self-intersection C consists of double points. Suppose that C is a single
circle in S^5. Then f^{-1}(C) in S^3 is a 1-knot or a 2-component 1-link. There
is a similar realization problem. We give a complete answer to this question.

  Title changed accordingly",,,,"math.AG math-ph math.DG math.MP math.SG",,"  The moduli space of stable vector bundles on a Riemann surface is smooth when
the rank and degree are coprime, and is diffeomorphic to the space of unitary
connections of central constant curvature. A classic result of Newstead and
Atiyah-Bott asserts that its rational cohomology ring is generated by the
universal classes, that is, by the Kunneth components of the Chern classes of
the universal bundle.
  This paper studies the larger, non-compact moduli space of Higgs bundles, as
introduced by Hitchin and Simpson, with values in the canonical bundle K. This
is diffeomorphic to the space of all connections of central constant curvature,
whether unitary or not. The main result of the paper is that, in the rank 2
case, the rational cohomology ring of this space is again generated by
universal classes.
  The spaces of Higgs bundles with values in K(n) for n > 0 turn out to be
essential to the story. Indeed, we show that their direct limit has the
homotopy type of the classifying space of the gauge group, and hence has
cohomology generated by universal classes.
  A companion paper treats the problem of finding relations between these
generators in the rank 2 case.

symmetry that are found to have a measure of entanglement which is related to

entirely different from the standard forms. This raises the question of the
connection between these forms and the standard forms. In this paper, we answer
this question. We not only derive the standard matrix treatment of spin
addition - we discover a more generalized form of the theory. We apply the new
generalized theory to the singlet and triplet states arising from the addition
of the spins of two systems of spin 1/2 each. We obtain new generalized forms

standard forms in the appropriate limit.
