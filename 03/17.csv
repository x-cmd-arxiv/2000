  Mass Accretion Rate in Low-Mass X-ray Binaries","Minor revisions to match the published version",,"10.1086/312646",,"astro-ph",,"  For all sources in which the phenomenon of kilo-Hertz quasi-periodic
oscillation (kHz QPO) is observed, the QPOs disappear abruptly when the
inferred mass accretion rate exceeds a certain threshold. Although the
threshold cannot at present be accurately determined (or even quantified)
observationally, it is clearly higher for bright Z sources than for faint atoll
sources. Here we propose that the observational manifestation of kHz QPOs {\em
requires} direct interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the
Keplerian accretion disk and that the cessation of kHz QPOs at high accretion
rate is due to the lack of such an interact when the Keplerian disk terminates
at the last stable orbit and yet the magnetosphere is pushed farther inward.
The threshold is therefore dependent of the magnetic field strength -- the
stronger the magnetic field the higher the threshold. This is certainly in
agreement with the atoll/Z paradigm, but we argue that it is also generally
true, even for individual sources within each (atoll or Z) category. For atoll
sources, the kHz QPOs also seem to vanish at low accretion rate. Perhaps the
``disengagement'' between the magnetosphere and the Keplerian disk also takes
place under such circumstances, because of, for instance, the presence of
quasi-spherical advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) close to the neutron
star. Unfortunately, in this case, the estimation of the accretion rate
threshold would require a knowledge of the physical mechanisms that cause the
disengagement. If the ADAF is responsible, the threshold is likely dependent of
the magnetic field of the neutron star.

Timing Explorer. The source was detected at a flux level of 3.6x10^-10 erg
cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.7--10.0 keV band, which corresponds to the X-ray luminosity
of 1.8x10^38 erg s^-1, if a distance of 65 kpc for this pulsar in the Small
Magellanic Cloud is assumed. Nearly sinusoidal pulsations with a period of
30.9497 +/- 0.0004 s were unambiguously detected during the ASCA observation.
The pulsed fraction is low and slightly energy dependent with average value of
\~27%. The energy spectrum shows a large soft excess below ~2 keV when fitted
to a simple power-law type model. The soft excess is eliminated if the spectrum
is fitted to an ``inversely broken power-law'' model, in which photon indices
below and above a break energy of 1.5 keV are 2.3 and 0.8, respectively. The
soft excess can also be described by a blackbody or a thermal bremsstrahlung
when the spectrum above ~2 keV is modeled by a power-law. In these models,
however, the thermal soft component requires a very large emission zone, and
hence it is difficult to explain the observed pulsations at energies below 2
keV. A bright state of the source enables us to identify a weak iron line
feature at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of 50 +/- 14 eV. Pulse phase
resolved spectroscopy revealed a slight hardening of the spectrum and marginal
indication of an increase in the iron line strength during the pulse maximum.

will leak through the surface. Expressions for the cut-off frequency are

not in agreement with the prediction for the uniform Heisenberg chain, but can
be explained if there is a moderate ferromagnetic interchain coupling and/or if
J changes with T. By fitting the chi(T) data, we obtain Delta(T = 0) = 103(2)

degeneracy $g(E)$. This quantity is independent of thermodynamic concepts such
as thermal equilibrium. It only depends on the distribution of allowed (micro)
states along the energy axis, but not on the energy changes between the system
and its environment. Once one has obtained $g(E)$, no further effort is needed
in order to consider different environment conditions, for instance, different
temperatures, for the same system.
  The method is based on the exact relation between $g(E)$ and the
microcanonical averages of certain macroscopic quantities $N^{\rm up}$ and
$N^{\rm dn}$. For an application to a particular problem, one needs to choose
an adequate instrument in order to determine the averages $<N^{\rm up}(E)>$ and
$<N^{\rm dn}(E)>$, as functions of energy. Replacing the usual
fixed-temperature canonical by the fixed-energy microcanonical ensemble, new
subtle concepts emerge. The temperature, for instance, is no longer an external
parameter controlled by the user, all canonical averages being functions of
this parameter. Instead, the microcanonical temperature $T_{m}(E)$ is a
function of energy defined from $g(E)$ itself, being thus an {\bf internal}
(environment independent) characteristic of the system. Accordingly, all
microcanonical averages are functions of $E$.
  The present text is an overview of the method. Some features of the
microcanonical ensemble are also discussed, as well as some clues towards the
definition of efficient Monte Carlo microcanonical sampling rules.

event-shape variables like the thrust T. Previous investigations showed that
the perturbative contribution to the average thrust is dominated by gluons of
small invariant mass, of the order of 10% of Q, where Q is the center-of-mass
energy. The effect of soft gluons is also important, leading to a
non-perturbative 1/Q correction. These conclusions are based on renormalon
analysis in the single dressed gluon (SDG) approximation. Here we analyze
higher moments of the thrust distribution using a similar technique. We find
that the characteristic gluon invariant mass contributing to <(1-T)^m>
increases with m. Yet, for m=2 this scale is quite low, around 27% of Q, and
therefore renormalon resummation is still very important. On the other hand,
the power-correction to <(1-T)^2> from a single soft gluon emission is found to
be highly suppressed: it scales as 1/Q^3. In practice, <(1-T)^2> and higher
moments depend also on soft gluon emission from configurations of three hard
partons, which may lead to alpha_s(Q^2)/Q power-corrections. This issue is yet
to be investigated.

introduced on the lattice via the 't Hooft loop operator. We consider the

substitute for the Dirac strings which cost no action on the lattice, we allow
for singular gauge potentials which are absent in the standard continuum
version. Once the Dirac strings are allowed, it turns possible to find a
solution with zero action for a monopole--antimonopole pair. This implies
equivalence of the standard and modified continuum versions in perturbation
theory. To imitate the nonperturbative vacuum, we introduce then a nonsingular
background. The modified continuum version of the gluodynamics allows in this
case for monopoles with finite non-vanishing action. Using similar techniques,
we construct the 't Hooft loop operator in the continuum and predict its

relativistic wave equations for particles with definite spin and mass. There
exist two different types of scalar functions (which describe the same mass and
spin), one related to a finite-dimensional nonunitary representation and
another one related to an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of the
Lorentz subgroup. This allows us to derive both usual finite-component wave
equations for spin-tensor fields and positive energy infinite-component wave
equations.

a Langevin-dynamics approach. The interaction forces are taken to have simple
forms that favor the growth of straight fibers from solution. The
force-velocity relation is obtained from the simulations for two versions of
the monomer-monomer force field. It is found that the growth rate drops off
more rapidly with applied force than expected from the simplest theories based
on thermal motion of the obstacle. The discrepancies amount to a factor of
three or more when the applied force exceeds 2.5kT/a, where a is the step size
for the polymer growth. These results are explained on the basis of restricted
diffusion of monomers near the fiber tip. It is also found that the mobility of
the obstacle has little effect on the growth rate, over a broad range.

and therefore cannot thermalize by themselves. Doppler shifts due to thermal
motions of cavity walls provide necessary mixing, but also preserve the
amplitudes and phases. The lambda/2 intervals of the modes thus preserved must
have equal energy expectations, say <E>, in the resulting equilibrium. By
definition again, they can be exchanged between modes only in whole numbers and
hence only between harmonics. Each family of harmonic modes is thus
self-contained and is disjoint from other families in such exchanges, and
further, can have no more than one mode excited at any instant. The second
property identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic
oscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to
exactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the
energy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the
equilibrium energy <E(f)> steadily available at a given mode would have
contributions from its entire harmonic family. Planck's equations reemerge, and
radiation quantization arises as a classical rule <E(f)> = <E>f, as a mode must
contain a whole number of exchangeable lambda/2 intervals, but it only concerns
equilibrium states. The result makes Planck constant h an analogue of
Boltzmann's constant k for the frequency domain, and points to postulate-free
explanations of all aspects of quantum and kinetic theories.

and conditions implied in the widespread representation of numbers by composite
quantum systems. Any nonempty set and associated operations is a set of natural
numbers or a model of arithmetic if the set and operations satisfy the axioms
of number theory or arithmetic. This work is limited to k-ary representations
of length L and to the axioms for arithmetic modulo k^{L}. A model of the
axioms is described based on states in and operators on an abstract L fold
tensor product Hilbert space H^{arith}. Unitary maps of this space onto a
physical parameter based product space H^{phy} are then described. Each of
these maps makes states in H^{phy}, and the induced operators, a model of the
axioms. Consequences of the existence of many of these maps are discussed along
with the dependence of Grover's and Shor's Algorithms on these maps. The
importance of the main physical requirement, that the basic arithmetic
operations are efficiently implementable, is discussed. This conditions states
that there exist physically realizable Hamiltonians that can implement the
basic arithmetic operations and that the space-time and thermodynamic resources
required are polynomial in L.
