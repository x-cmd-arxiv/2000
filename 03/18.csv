  multiresolution-decomposed covariance -- I. method","AAS Latex file, 44 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/309207",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method of measuring galaxy power spectrum based on the
multiresolution analysis of the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Since
the DWT representation has strong capability of suppressing the off-diagonal
components of the covariance for selfsimilar clustering, the DWT covariance for
popular models of the cold dark matter cosmogony generally is diagonal, or
$j$(scale)-diagonal in the scale range, in which the second scale-scale
correlations are weak. In this range, the DWT covariance gives a lossless
estimation of the power spectrum, which is equal to the corresponding Fourier
power spectrum banded with a logarithmical scaling. In the scale range, in
which the scale-scale correlation is significant, the accuracy of a power
spectrum detection depends on the scale-scale or band-band correlations. This
is, for a precision measurements of the power spectrum, a measurement of the
scale-scale or band-band correlations is needed. We show that the DWT
covariance can be employed to measuring both the band-power spectrum and second
order scale-scale correlation. We also present the DWT algorithm of the binning
and Poisson sampling with real observational data. We show that the alias
effect appeared in usual binning schemes can exactly be eliminated by the DWT
binning. Since Poisson process possesses diagonal covariance in the DWT
representation, the Poisson sampling and selection effects on the power
spectrum and second order scale-scale correlation detection are suppressed into
minimum. Moreover, the effect of the non-Gaussian features of the Poisson
sampling can be calculated in this frame.

  multi-band radio polarization observations","4 pages, 4 figures, to be published in A&A Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss observations of the linearly polarized component of the diffuse
galactic radio background. These observations, with an angular resolution of
4', were made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in 5
frequency bands in the range 341-375 MHz. The linearly polarized intensity P
(with polarized brightness temperature going up to 10K) shows a `cloudy'
structure, with characteristic scales of 15'-30', which contains relatively
long, but very narrow `canals' (essentially unresolved) in which P is only a
small fraction of that in the neighbouring beams.
  These `canals' are generally seen in more than one frequency band, although
their appearance changes between bands. They are probably due to depolarization
within the synthesized beam, because the change in polarization angle across
the deepest `canals' is in general close to 90 degrees (or 270 etc.). These
very abrupt changes in polarization angle, which are seen only across the
`canals', seem to be accompanied by abrupt changes in the Rotation Measure
(RM), which may have the right magnitude to create the difference of close to
90 degrees in polarization angle, and thereby the `canals'.
  The structure in the polarization maps is most likely due to Faraday rotation
modulation of the probably smooth polarized radiation emitted in the halo of
our Galaxy by the fairly local ISM (up to 500 pc). Therefore, the abrupt
changes of RM across the `canals' provide evidence for very thin (about 1 pc),
and relatively long transition regions in the ISM, across which the RM changes
by as much as 100%. Such drastic RM changes may well be due primarily to abrupt
changes in the magnetic field.

ejected in the explosion is confined to a jet which propagates in a medium with

density medium the increase in the power-law index ($\beta$) of the light-curve
as a result of this {\it edge effect} is $\sim0.7$ and is completed over one
decade in observer time. For a pre-ejected stellar wind ($\rho \propto r^{-2}$)
$\beta$ increases by $\sim0.4$ over two decades in time due to the edge effect
and the steepening of the light-curve due to the jet sideways expansion takes
about four decades in time. Therefore, a break in the light-curve for a jet in
a wind model is unlikely to be detected even for very narrow jets of opening
angle of a few degrees or less, in which case the lateral expansion occurs at
early times when the afterglow is bright.
  The light-curve for the afterglow of GRB 990510, for which an increase in
$\beta$ of approximately 1.35 was observed on a time scale of 3 days, cannot be
explained only by the sideways expansion and the edge effects in a jet in a

passage of the cooling or synchrotron peak frequencies through the observing

final core collapse of ordinary stars with M \ga 30 M_{\odot}, then about
25,000 stellar mass black holes should have migrated by dynamical friction into
the central parsec of the Milky Way, forming a black hole cluster around the
central supermassive black hole. These black holes can be captured by the
central black hole when they randomly reach a highly eccentric orbit due to
relaxation, either by direct capture (when their Newtonian peribothron is less
than 4 Schwarzschild radii), or after losing orbital energy through
gravitational waves. The overall depletion timescale is ~ 30 Gyr, so most of
the 25,000 black holes remain in the central cluster today. The presence of
this black hole cluster would have several observable consequences. First, the
low-mass, old stellar population should have been expelled from the region
occupied by the black hole cluster due to relaxation, implying a core in the
profile of solar-mass red giants with a radius of ~ 2 pc (i.e., 1'). The
observed central density cusp (which has a core radius of only a few arc
seconds) should be composed primarily of young (\la 1 Gyr) stars. Second,
flares from stars being captured by supermassive black holes in other galaxies
should be rarer than usually expected because the older stars will have been
expelled from the central regions by the black hole clusters of those galaxies.
Third, the young (\la 2 Gyr) stars found at distances ~ 3 - 10 pc from the
Galactic center should be preferentially on highly eccentric orbits. Fourth, if
future high-resolution $K$-band images reveal sources microlensed by the Milky
Way's central black hole, then the cluster black holes could give rise to
secondary (``planet-like'') perturbations on the main event.

later times fractures penetrate into the material, and tend to form polygonal
patterns. We show that this ordering can be described as a tendency to minimize
an energy functional. Atomistic simulations confirm this interpretation.
Numerical simulations based on a phenomenological implementation of this
principle generate patterns that have remarkably good statistical agreement
with real ones.

thermally activated two-level model. An estimate of the energy difference

nonuniversality the range of the LSP mass can be extended much beyond the range

theory on a compact oriented four-manifold by analysing the behaviour of a
generalised partition function under modular transformations of the

more complicated behaviour depending on topological properties of the
four-manifold concerned. It is already known that there may be ""modular

signature of the four-manifold. But sometimes the partition function transforms
only under a subgroup of the modular group (the Hecke subgroup). In this case
it is impossible to define real spinor wave functions on the four-manifold. But
complex spinors are possible provided the background magnetic fluxes are
appropriately fractional rather that integral. This gives rise to a second
partition function which enables the full modular group to be realised by
permuting the two partition functions, together with a third. Thus the full
modular group is realised in all cases. The demonstration makes use of various
constructions concerning integral lattices and theta functions that seem to be

consider traces of intertwiners between certain representations of the

which are twisted by a ``generalized Belavin-Drinfeld triple'', i.e a triple
consisting of two subdiagrams of the Dynkin diagram of g together with an
isomorphism between them. The generating functions F(lambda,mu) for such traces
depend on two weights lambda and mu. We show that F(lambda,mu) satisfy two sets
of difference equations in the variable lambda: the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (MR)
equations and the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
  (qKZB) equations. These equations involve as a main ingredient the quantum
dynamical R-matrices constructed in math.QA/9912009. When the generalized
Belavin-Drinfeld triple is an automorphism, we show that F(lambda,mu) satisfy
another two sets of difference equations with respect to the weight mu. These
