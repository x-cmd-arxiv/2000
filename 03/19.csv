  by Chandra","16 pages, 5 figures, accepted by New Astronomy",,"10.1016/S1384-1076(00)00017-8",,"astro-ph",,"  We report optical spectroscopic identifications of 10 hard (2-10 keV) X-ray
selected sources discovered by Chandra. The X-ray flux of the sources ranges
between 1.5 and 25 x 10-14 cgs, the lower value being 3 times fainter than in
previous BeppoSAX and ASCA surveys. Their R band magnitudes are in the range
12.8-22. Six of the Chandra sources are broad line quasars with redshifts
between 0.42 and 1.19, while the optical identification of the remaining four
is quite varied: two are X-ray obscured, emission line AGN at z=0.272 and
z=0.683, one is a starburst galaxy at z=0.016 and one, most unusually, is an
apparently normal galaxy at z=0.158. These findings confirm and extend down to
fainter X-ray fluxes the BeppoSAX results, in providing samples with a wide
range of X-ray and optical properties. The ratio between the soft X-ray and the
optical luminosity of the z=0.158 galaxy is a factor at least 30 higher than
that of normal galaxies, and similar to those of AGN. The high X-ray luminosity
and the lack of optical emission lines suggest an AGN in which either continuum
beaming dominates, or emission lines are obscured or not efficiently produced.

Linker","Evidence for topological nonequilibrium in magnetic configurations","10 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.62.1245",,"astro-ph",,"  We use direct numerical simulations to study the evolution, or relaxation, of
magnetic configurations to an equilibrium state. We use the full single-fluid
equations of motion for a magnetized, non-resistive, but viscous fluid; and a
Lagrangian approach is used to obtain exact solutions for the magnetic field.
As a result, the topology of the magnetic field remains unchanged, which makes
it possible to study the case of topological nonequilibrium. We find two cases
for which such nonequilibrium appears, indicating that these configurations may
develop singular current sheets.

  Solubility Conditions","9 pages, 3 figures, uses revtex and graphicx",,"10.1007/s101890170123",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Polyelectrolytes such as single and double stranded DNA and many synthetic
polymers undergo two structural transitions upon increasing the concentration
of multivalent salt or molecules. First, the expanded-stretched chains in low
monovalent salt solutions collapse into nearly neutral compact structures when
the density of multivalent salt approaches that of the monomers. With further
addition of multivalent salt the chains redissolve acquiring expanded-coiled
conformations. We study the redissolution transition using a two state model
[F. Solis and M. Olvera de la Cruz, {\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 112} (2000)
2030]. The redissolution occurs when there is a high degree of screening of the
electrostatic interactions between monomers, thus reducing the energy of the
expanded state. The transition is determined by the chemical potential of the
multivalent ions in the solution $\mu$ and the inverse screening length
$\kappa$. The transition point also depends on the charge distribution along
the chain but is almost independent of the molecular weight and degree of
flexibility of the polyelectrolytes. We generate a diagram of $\mu$ versus
$\kappa^2$ where we find two regions of expanded conformations, one with
charged chains and other with overcharged (inverted charge) chains, separated
by a collapsed nearly neutral conformation region. The collapse and
redissolution transitions occur when the trajectory of the properties of the
salt crosses the boundaries between these regions. We find that in most cases
the redissolution occurs within the same expanded branch from which the chain
precipitates.

that this model predicts pairing, consistent with experiments, and argue how
the macroscopic phase-coherent state gradually grows upon lowering of the

have significant pair binding in the thermodynamic limit. Particularly, {\it
local} breaking of SU(2) spin symmetry is an efficient mechanism for inducing
pairing of two holes, as well as explaining the magnetic scattering properties.
We also discuss the connection of the resulting inhomogeneity-induced
superconductivity to recent experimental evidence for a linear relation between
magnetic incommensurability and the superconducting transition temperature, as
a function of doping.

introduce two classes of microscopic models which capture the magnetic and
superconducting properties of these strongly correlated materials. We start
from a generalized t-J model, in which appropriate inhomogeneous terms mimic
stripes. We find that inhomogeneous interactions that break magnetic symmetries
are essential to induce substantial pair binding of holes in the thermodynamic
limit. We argue that this type of model reproduces the ARPES and neutron
scattering data seen experimentally.

Randall-Sundrum scenario of gravity. Without the matter, this field
($h=\eta^{MN}h_{MN}$) is a gauge-dependent term, and thus it can be gauged
away. But, including the uniform source $\tilde{T}_{MN}$, this field satisfies
the linearized equation $\Box_4 h =16\pi G_5 T^{\mu}_{\mu}$. This may
correspond to the scalar $\xi^5$ in the bending of the brane due to the
localized source. Considering the case of longitudinal perturbations ($h_{5\mu}
=h_{55}=0$), one finds the source relation
$\tilde{T}^{\mu}_{\mu}=2\tilde{T}_{55}$, which leads to the ghost states in the
massive modes. In addition, if one requires $T_{44}=2(T_{22}+T_{33})$, it is
found that in the limit of $m^2_h \to 0$ we have the massless spin-2
propagation without the ghost state. This exactly corresponds to the same
situation as in the intermediate scales of Gregory-Rubakov-Sibiryakov (GRS)
model.
