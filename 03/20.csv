VI absorber at 0.15 < z(abs) < 0.27. The four definite O VI absorbers are
located near galaxies and are highly displaced from the quasar in redshift;
these are likely intervening systems unrelated to the background QSO. In the
case of the strong O VI system at z(abs) = 0.22497, multiple components are
detected in Si III and O VI as well as H I Lyman series lines, and the
differing component velocity centroids and b-values firmly establish that this
is a multiphase absorption system. A weak O VI absorber is detected at z(abs) =
0.22637, i.e., offset by ~340 km/s from the z(abs) = 0.22497 system. Lya
absorption is detected at z(abs) = 0.22613, but no Lya absorption is
significantly detected at 0.22637. Other weak O VI absorbers at z(abs) =
0.24531 and 0.26659 and the probable O VI system at 0.21326 have widely diverse
O VI/H I column density ratios with N(O VI)/N(H I) ranging from <=0.14+/-0.03

30 mA in the H1821+643 spectrum is remarkably high, dN/dz ~48, with a high
(90%) confidence that it is greater than 17. We conservatively estimate that
the cosmological mass density of the O VI systems Omega_b(O VI) > 0.0008/h_75.
With an assumed metallicity of 1/10 solar and a conservative assumption that
the fraction of oxygen in the O VI ionization stage is 0.2, we obtain Omega_b(O
VI) > 0.004/h_75. This is comparable to the combined cosmological mass density
of stars and cool gas in galaxies and X-ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters at

optical depth predicted from radiation transfer simulations. These two tracers
of dust show a very similar distribution along the minor axis and a reasonable
agreement along the major axis. Assuming that the grains responsible for
optical extinction are also the source of 850um emission we derive a
submillimeter emissivity (emission efficiency) for dust in the NGC 891 disk.
This quantity is found to be a factor of 2-3 higher than the generally-accepted
(but highly uncertain) values adopted for the Milky Way. It should be stated,
however, that if a substantial fraction of dust in NGC 891 is clumped, the
emissivity in the two galaxies may be quite similar. We use our newly-acquired
emissivity to convert our 850um images into detailed maps of dust mass and,
utilizing 21cm and CO-emission data for NGC 891, derive the gas-to-dust ratio
along the disk. We compute an average ratio of 260 -- a value consistent with
the Milky Way and external spirals within the uncertainties in deriving both
the dust mass and the quantity of molecular gas. The bulk of dust in NGC 891
appears to be closely associated with the molecular gas phase although it may
start to follow the distribution of atomic hydrogen at radii >9 kpc (i.e. >0.5
R_25). Using the optical depth of the NGC 891 disk, we quantify how light
emitted at high redshift is attenuated by dust residing in foreground spirals.
For B-band observations of galaxies typically found in the Hubble Deep Field,
the amount of light lost is expected to be small (~ 5%). This value depends
critically on the maximum radial extent of cold dust in spiral disks (which is
poorly known). It may also represent a lower limit if galaxies expel dust over
time into the intergalactic medium.

to be the ``functional part'' of logic programs. As a consequence of this it
has become widely accepted that ``complex'' logical variables, the possibility

CM elliptic curves using a new explicit description of the specialization of
the elliptic polylogarithm. The Tamagawa number conjecture describes the
special values of the L-function of a CM elliptic curve in terms of the
regulator maps of the K-theory of the variety into Deligne and etale
cohomology. The regulator map to Deligne cohomology was computed by Deninger
with the help of the Eisenstein symbol. For the Tamagawa number conjecture one
needs an understanding of the $p$-adic regulator on the subspace of K-theory
defined by the Eisenstein symbol. This is accomplished by giving a new explicit
computation of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf. It turns
out that this sheaf is an inverse limit of $p^r$-torsion points of a certain
one-motive. The cohomology classes of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf can then
be described by classes of sections of certain line bundles. These sections are
elliptic units and going carefully through the construction one finds an analog
of the elliptic Soul\'e elements. Finally Rubin's ``main conjecture'' of
Iwasawa theory is used to compare these elements with etale cohomology.

which are closely related to the simplest examples of CM elliptic curves. He
and Montgomery showed the non-vanishing of the central value when the
L-function has an even functional equation, and we now show the non-vanishing
of the central derivative when the functional equation is odd. Using the
results of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin-Logachev, we can apply the non-vanishing
to the ranks and Shafarevitch-Tate groups of the Q-curves ""A(p)"" studied by
Gross in his thesis. In particular, their rank is determined by a congruence
condition. http://www.math.yale.edu/users/steve/milleryang

$h(\epsilon)$, in dynamical systems, stochastic processes and turbulence.
Particular emphasis is devoted on a recently proposed approach to the
calculation of the $\epsilon$-entropy based on the exit-time statistics. The
advantages of this method are demonstrated in examples of deterministic
diffusive maps, intermittent maps, stochastic self-affine and multi-affine
signals and experimental turbulent data. Concerning turbulence, the
multifractal formalism applied to the exit time statistics allows us to predict
that $h(\epsilon)\sim \epsilon^{-3}$ for velocity time measurement. This power
law is independent of the presence of intermittency and has been confirmed by
the experimental data analysis. Moreover, we show that the $\epsilon$-entropy
density of a 3-dimensional velocity field is affected by the correlations
induced by the sweeping of large scales.

function"" (or ""decoherence"" in its broadest meaning) in quantum mechanics is
the nonlinearities already present in the theory via nonabelian gauge

to the best of our knowledge, the only one which does not introduce any new
elements into the theory. Indeed, unless the gauge interaction nonlinearities
are not used for exactly this purpose, one must then explain why the violation
of the superposition principle which they introduce does not destroy quantum
mechanics. A possible experimental test of the model would be to compare the
coherence lengths for, e.g., electrons and photons in a double-slit experiment.
The electrons should have a finite coherence length, while photons should have
a much longer (in principle infinite) coherence length.

of the amount of information manipulated in a given time, quantum and classical
computation are equally efficient. Quantum superposition does not permit
quantum computers to ``perform many computations simultaneously'' except in a
highly qualified and to some extent misleading sense. Quantum computation is
therefore not well described by interpretations of quantum mechanics which
invoke the concept of vast numbers of parallel universes. Rather, entanglement
makes available types of computation process which, while not exponentially
larger than classical ones, are unavailable to classical systems. The essence
of quantum computation is that it uses entanglement to generate and manipulate
a physical representation of the correlations between logical entities, without
the need to completely represent the logical entities themselves.
