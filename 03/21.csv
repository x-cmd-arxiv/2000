conditions of the narrow line region (NLR) of seven narrow-line Seyfert 1

the [OIII] 5007/H-beta ratio emitted in the NLR varies from 1 to 5, instead of
the universally adopted value of 10. This has strong implications for the
required spectral energy distribution that ionizes the NLR gas. Photoionization
models that consider a NLR composed of a combination of matter-bounded and
ionization-bounded clouds are successful at explaining the low [OIII]
5007/H-beta ratio and the weakness of low-ionization lines of NLS1s. Variation
of the relative proportion of these two type of clouds nicely reproduce the
dispersion of narrow line ratios found among the NLS1 sample. Assuming similar
physical model parameters of both NLS1s and the normal Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC
5548, we show that the observed differences of emission line ratios between
these two groups can be explained in terms of the shape of the input ionizing
continuum. Narrow emission line ratios of NLS1s are better reproduced by a
steep power-law continuum in the EUV -- soft X-ray region, with spectral index
alpha ~ -2. Flatter spectral indices (alpha ~ -1.5) match the observed line
ratios of NGC 5548 but are unable to provide a good match to the NLS1 ratios.
This result is consistent with ROSAT observations of NLS1s, which show that

adiabatic compression, and non-gravitational processes such as heating by SNe,
stellar winds, activity in the central galactic nucleus, and radiative cooling.
The effect of gravitational processes on the thermodynamics of the Intra
Cluster Medium (ICM) can be expressed in terms of the ICM entropy S ~
ln(T/\rho^{2/3}). We use a generalized spherical model to compute the X-ray
properties of groups and clusters for a range of initial entropy levels in the
ICM and for a range of mass scales, cosmic epochs and background cosmologies.
We find that the statistical properties of the X-ray clusters strongly depend
on the value of the initial excess entropy. Assuming a constant, uniform value
for the excess entropy, the present-day X-ray data are well fitted for the
following range of values K_* = kT/\mu m_p \rho^{2/3} = (0.4\pm 0.1) \times
10^{34} erg cm^2 g^{-5/3} for clusters with average temperatures kT>2 keV; K_*

energy per particle of kT \geq 0.1 (K_*/0.4\times 10^{34}) keV. The dependence

entropy: the relation K_* = 0.8(1+z)^{-1}\times 10^{34} erg cm^2 g^{-5/3} fits
the data over the whole temperature range. Observations of both local and

weakly dependent on radio luminosity. Radio galaxy hosts at z~2 are
significantly brighter than the hosts of radio-quiet quasars at similar

passive evolution of a stellar population that formed at z>~3. This scenario is
consistent with studies of host galaxy morphology and submillimeter continuum

The magnitude of the timing noise, however, is large relative to the noise
level typically found in radio pulsars. Combining these results with the noise

photoionization models to determine whether some of these objects may be
powered solely by young star clusters rather than by accretion-powered active
nuclei. The models were calculated with the photoionization code CLOUDY, using
evolving starburst continua generated by the the STARBURST99 code of Leitherer
et al. (1999). We find that the models are able to reproduce the emission-line
spectra of transition nuclei, but only for instantaneous bursts of solar or
higher metallicity, and only for ages of ~3-5 Myr, the period when the
extreme-ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet stars.
For clusters younger than 3 Myr or older than 6 Myr, and for models with a
constant star-formation rate, the softer ionizing continuum results in an
emission spectrum more typical of H II regions. This model predicts that
Wolf-Rayet emission features should appear in the spectra of transition nuclei.
While such features have not generally been detected to date, they could be
revealed in observations having higher spatial resolution. Demographic
arguments suggest that this starburst model may not apply to the majority of
transition nuclei, particularly those in early-type host galaxies, but it could
account for some members of the transition class in hosts of type Sa and later.
The starburst models during the Wolf-Rayet-dominated phase can also reproduce
the narrow-line spectra of some LINERs, but only under conditions of
above-solar metallicity and only if high-density gas is present (n_e >~ 10^5
cm^{-3}). This scenario could be applicable to some ``Type 2'' LINERs which do
not show any clear signs of nonstellar activity.

axis to the line of sight. For six distinct definitions of ``angular size'', we
tabulate the error in distance that is introduced under the assumption of
spherical symmetry (i.e., without correcting for inclination and axis ratio).
The errors can be significant and systematic, affecting studies of novae
whether considered individually or statistically. Each of the six estimators
overpredicts the distance when the polar axis is close to the line of sight,
and most underpredict the distance when the polar axis is close to the plane of
the sky. The straight mean of the projected semimajor and semiminor axes gives
the least distance bias for an ensemble of randomly oriented prolate shells.
The best individual expansion distances, however, result from a full
spatio-kinematic modeling of the nova shell. We discuss several practical
complications that affect expansion distance measurements of real nova shells.
Nova shell expansion distances be based on velocity and angular size

absorptions at the same redshift. Absorption due to fine structure transitions
of C II and Si II (excitation energies corresponding to, respectively,
156$\mu$m and 34$\mu$m) are detected at z_abs = 3.8931. Excitation by IR
radiation is favored as the column density ratios are consistent with the shape
of APM 08279+5255 IR spectrum. The low-ionization state of the system favors a
picture where the cloud is closer to the IR source than to the UV source,
supporting the idea that the extension of the IR source is larger than ~ 200
pc. The absence of fine structure lines at z_abs = 3.9135 suggests that the gas
responsible for this system is farther away from the IR source. Abundances are
~ 0.01 and 1$Z_{\odot}$ at z_abs = 3.913 and 3.8931 and aluminum could be
over-abundant with respect to silicon and carbon by at least a factor of two

located within 200 pc from the QSO and ejected at a velocity larger than 1000

time `quintessence', and also by more conventional models of reheating. The
resultant modification to the pre-nucleosynthesis expansion rate can allow
solely an asymmetry in right handed electrons to produce a net baryon asymmetry
when reprocessed by the anomalous B+L violating processes of the standard
model. The production of such a source asymmetry - what we term
`electrogenesis' - requires no additional B or L violation beyond that in the
standard model. We consider a specific model for its generation, by a simple
perturbative out of equilibrium decay of Higgs like scalar fields with
CP-violating Yukawa couplings to the standard model leptons. We show that,
because of the much enhanced expansion rate, such a mechanism can easily
produce an adequate asymmetry from scalars with masses as low as 1 TeV. Kinetic
mode domination is strongly favoured because it evades large entropy release
which dilutes the asymmetry. We also discuss briefly the effect of the abelian
hypercharge anomaly.

plasma may be investigated through the tools of perturbative QCD. This approach
has recently been successfully applied to the study of color superconductivity,
where the dominant di-quark pairing interaction arises from one gluon exchange.
Screening in the plasma leads to novel behaviour, including a remarkable
non-BCS scaling of T_C, the transition temperature to the color superconducting
phase. Radiative corrections to one gluon exchange were previously considered
and found to affect T_C. In particular, the quark self-energy in a plasma leads
to non-Fermi liquid behaviour and suppresses T_C. However, at the same time,
the quark-gluon vertex was shown not to modify the result at leading order.
This dichotomy between the effects of the radiative corrections at first
appears rather surprising, as the BRST identity connects the self-energy to the
vertex corrections. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate, there is in fact no
contradiction with the BRST identity, at least to leading log order. This
clarifies some of the previous statements on the importance of the higher order
corrections to the determination of T_C and the zero temperature gap in color
superconductivity.

positive probability, the problem of keeping a bit of information indefinitely
is nontrivial, even in an infinite automaton. Still, there is a solution in 2
dimensions, and this solution can be used to construct a simple 3-dimensional
discrete-time universal fault-tolerant cellular automaton. This technique does
not help much to solve the following problems: remembering a bit of information
in 1 dimension; computing in dimensions lower than 3; computing in any
dimension with non-synchronized transitions.
  Our more complex technique organizes the cells in blocks that perform a
reliable simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton. The cells of
the latter automaton are also organized in blocks, simulating even more
reliably a third automaton, etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy)
is organized in ``software'', it must be under repair all the time from damage
caused by errors. A large part of the problem is essentially self-stabilization
recovering from a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper
constructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant cellular automaton,
with the further feature of ``self-organization''. The latter means that unless
a large amount of input information must be given, the initial configuration
can be chosen homogeneous.

suggests, a weak version of stationary reflection. This sort of reflection was
introduced in [DjSh:545] (math.LO/9601219), where it was shown that weak
reflection has applications to various guessing principles, in the sense that
if there is no weak reflection, than a guessing principle holds, and an
application dealing with the saturation of normal filters. Further
investigations of weak reflection were carried in [CDSh:571] (math.LO/9504221)
and [CuSh:596] (math.LO/9703219). While various ZFC restrictions on the one
hand, and independence results on the other, were discovered about the weak
reflection, the question of the relative consistency of the existence of a
regular cardinal kappa such that the first cardinal weakly reflecting at kappa
is a successor of singular, remained open. This paper answers that question by
proving that (modulo large cardinal assumptions close to 2-hugeness) that there
indeed can be such a cardinal kappa.

foliation groupoid is a Lie groupoid which integrates a foliation, or,
equivalently, whose anchor map is injective. The first theorem shows that, for
a Lie groupoid G, the following are equivalent:
  - G is a foliation groupoid,
  - G has discrete isotropy groups,
  - G is Morita equivalent to an etale groupoid.
  Moreover, we show that among the Lie groupoids integrating a given foliation,
the holonomy and the monodromy groupoids are extreme examples.
  The second theorem shows that the cyclic homology of convolution algebras of
foliation groupoids is invariant under Morita equivalence of groupoids, and we
give explicit formulas. Combined with the previous results of Brylinski, Nistor

various foliation groupoids, like the (full) holonomy/monodromy groupoid, Lie
groupoids modeling orbifolds, and crossed products by actions of Lie groups
with finite stabilizers. Some parts of the proof, such as the H-unitality of

to longitudinal index theorems for foliations, we have added a few brief

dynamical variables with physical systems in quantum mechanics. Given the
`quantum logical' constraints that are typically adopted by such
interpretations, only certain sets of variables can be taken to be
simultaneously definite-valued, and only certain sets of values can be ascribed
to these variables at a given time. Moreover, each allowable set of variables
and values can be uniquely specified by a single `preferred' projector in the
Hilbert space associated with the system. In general, the preferred projector
can be one of several possibilities at a given time. In previous modal
interpretations, the different possible preferred projectors have formed an
orthogonal set. This paper investigates the consequences of adopting a
non-orthogonal set. We present three contributions on this issue: (1) we
provide an argument for such non-orthogonality, based on the assumption that
perfectly predictable measurements reveal pre-existing values of variables, an
assumption which has traditionally constituted a strong motivation for the
modal approach; (2) we generalize the existing framework for modal

and reach the ground state of vibration with up to 99.9% probability. Starting
from this Fock state $|n=0>$, we demonstrate coherent quantum state
manipulation. A large number of Rabi oscillations and a ms-coherence time is
observed. Motional heating is measured to be as low as one vibrational quantum
in 190 ms. We also report on ground state cooling of two ions.
