Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer (FIFI LS) for the SOFIA airborne
observatory. The design of the instrument is driven by the goal of maximizing
observing efficiency, especially for observations of faint, extragalactic
objects. Thus, FIFI LS utilizes an integral field technique that uses slicer
mirrors to optically re-arrange the two-dimensional field into a single slit
for a long slit spectrometer. Effectively, a 5x5 pixel spatial field of view is
imaged to a 25x1 pixel slit and dispersed to a 25x16 pixel, two-dimensional
detector array, providing diffraction-limited spatial and spectral
multiplexing. In this manner, the instrument employs two parallel, medium
resolution (R~2000) grating spectrometers for simultaneous observations in two
bands: a short wavelength band (42 to 110 micron) and a long wavelength band
(110 to 210 micron). Overall, for each of the 25 spatial pixels, the instrument
can cover a velocity range of ~1500 km/s around selected far-infrared lines
with an estimated sensitivity of 2x10^-15 W Hz^1/2 per pixel. This arrangement
provides good spectral coverage with high responsivity.

estimated from high-redshift Type Ia Supernov\ae data are reported, almost an
order of magnitude greater than previously found. They arise from the effects
of weak gravitational lensing on observations of high-redshift sources. The
lensing statistics used have been obtained from computations of the
three-dimensional shear in a range of cosmological N-body simulations, from
which it is estimated that cosmologies with an underlying deceleration
parameter q_0 = -0.51 +0.03/-0.24 may be interpreted as having q_0 = -0.55
(appropriate to the currently popular cosmology with density parameter
$\Omega_M = 0.3$ and vacuum energy density parameter $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7$).
In addition, the standard deviation expected from weak lensing for the peak
magnitudes of Type Ia Supernov\ae at redshifts of 1 is expected to be
approximately 0.078 magnitudes, and 0.185 magnitudes at redshift 2. This latter
value is greater than the accepted intrinsic dispersion of 0.17 magnitudes.
Consequently, the effects of weak lensing in observations of high-redshift
sources must be taken properly into account.

systematic trend of the cumulative chi^2 to increase with the mode number

corresponds to a decrease of the chi^2 with the variance associated with a

43 GHz to look for differences in the parsec-scale magnetic field structures of
18 high- and low-optically polarized, compact radio-loud quasars (HPQs and
LPRQs, respectively). We find a strong correlation between the polarization
level of the unresolved parsec-scale radio core at 43 GHz and overall optical
polarization of the source, which suggests a common (possibly co-spatial)
origin for the emission at these two wavelengths. The magnetic fields of the
polarized 43 GHz radio cores are aligned roughly transverse to the jet axis.
Similar orientations are seen in the optical, suggesting that the polarized
flux at both wavelengths is due to one or more strong transverse shocks located
very close to the base of the jet. In LPRQs, these shocks appear to be weak
near the core, and gradually increase in strength down the jet. The LPRQs in
our sample tend to have less luminous radio cores than the HPQs, and jet
components with magnetic fields predominantly parallel to the flow. The
components in HPQ jets, on the other hand, tend to have transverse alignments.
These differences cannot be accounted for by a simple model in which HPQs and
LPRQs are the same type of object, seen at different angles to the line of
sight. A more likely scenario is that LPRQs represent a quiescent phase of
blazar activity, in which the inner jet flow does not undergo strong shocks.

bright-line diagnostics. We use observations of 4 LMC HII regions whose
ionizing stars have classifications ranging from O7 to WN3. We assume a 2-zone
T_e structure to compute ionic abundances. We compare with photoionization
models tailored to the properties of the individual objects, and emphasize the
importance of correctly relating T_e in the two zones, which can otherwise
cause errors of ~0.2 dex in abundance estimates. There are no spatial
variations to within 0.1 - 0.15 dex in any of the objects, even one hosting 3
WR stars.
  Our data agree with the modeled R23 and S23 diagnostics of O and S. We
present the first theoretical tracks for S23, which are in excellent agreement
with a larger dataset. However, contrary to earlier suggestions, S23 is much
more sensitive to the ionization parameter than is R23, because S23 does not
sample S IV. We therefore introduce S234 = ([SII]+[SIII]+[SIV])/H-beta.
Predicted and observed spatial variations in S234 are dramatically reduced in
contrast to S23. The intensity of [SIV]10.5 microns is easily estimated from a
simple relation between [SIV]/[SIII] and [OIII]/[OII]. This method of
estimating S234 yields excellent agreement with our models, hence we give a
theoretical calibration for S234. The double-valued structure of S23 and S234
remains an important problem as for R23, and presently we consider the S
diagnostics reliable only at Z < 0.5 Z_sol. However, the slightly larger
dynamic range and excellent compatibility with theoretical predictions suggest
the S diagnostics to be more effective abundance indicators than R23.

any correlation between the continuum flux and the MgII line flux, thus
resolving a standing controversy in the literature concerning the origin of the
MgII line flux. There is no correlation between the color temperature of the UV
continuum and the average value of its flux. Using models of the accretion
process developed by Calvet & Gullbring (1998), we obtain energy fluxes,
accretion spot sizes, and accretion rates from the IUE observations of BP

spot sizes of 4.4 10^{-3} times the stellar surface, and average accretion
rates of 1.6 10^-8 msun/yr. Our analysis shows that the particle energy flux

strikingly, we observe a correlation between accretion rate and spot size, with
the spot size increasing as the square of the accretion rate. Based on the
results of a simulation, we conclude that geometrical effects are not enough to
account for this effect. Current models of the accretion process fail to
reproduce such an effect, suggesting the need of using more realistic

these new discoveries shows that H-alpha emission has yet to be convincingly
detected in any L dwarf later than type L4.5, indicating a decline or absence

16 (and possibly 4 more) of the new L dwarfs are lithium brown dwarfs and that
the average line strength for those L dwarfs showing lithium increases until
roughly type L6.5 V then declines for later types. This disappearance may be
the first sign of depletion of atomic lithium as it begins to form into
lithium-bearing molecules. Another goal of the search was to locate nearer,
brighter L dwarfs of all subtypes. Using absolute magnitudes for 17 L dwarf
systems with trigonometric parallax measurements, we develop spectrophotometric
relations to estimate distances to the other L dwarfs. Of the 67 new
discoveries, 21 have photometric distances placing them within 25 parsecs of
the Sun. A table of all known L and T dwarfs believed to lie within 25 parsecs

coolest L dwarf known, we calculate that the gap in temperature between L8 and
the warmest known T dwarfs is less than 350K and probably much less. If the
transition region between the two classes spans a very small temperature
interval, this would explain why no transition objects have yet been uncovered.
This evidence, combined with model fits to low-resolution spectra of late-M and
early-L dwarfs, indicates that L dwarfs span the range 1300K < Teff < 2000K.

SBS 0335-052. Its very high mass fraction of gas (~95% of all visible mass) and
blue colours of underlying nebulosity are also similar to those of SBS

galaxies experiencing a recently-started first star formation (SF) episode. Its
properties imply that for such galaxies there is a linear scaling of the main
parameters, at least for the baryon mass range (0.3-20)x10^8 M_sun. The total
mass estimate indicates that the galaxy is dynamically dominated by a dark
matter (DM) halo, which itself is one of the least massive for galaxies.

  Collapse to a Black Hole","shortened and re-organized version, 13 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to
  the International Journal of Modern Physics D",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the emission of gravitational waves in the two proposed models
for the collapse of a massive star to a black hole: the prompt collapse, in
which nearly all the star collapses to a black hole in a dynamical time scale,
and the delayed collapse, in which a light black hole, or a neutron star, which
subsequently accretes matter, forms due to the fall-back achieving, in the
neutron star case, the critical mass for black hole formation. Recent
simulations strongly support this last scenario. We show that, due to the
slowness of fall-back, in the delayed collapse the main burst of gravitational
radiation is emitted depending on the parameters, mass and angular momentum, of
the initial, light, black hole. We estimate, under different assumptions, the
detectability of the emitted gravitational waves showing that such kind of
collapse is not particularly suited for detection by forthcoming
interferometric detectors. Detectors with high sensitivity at frequencies
greater than ~4-5 kHz would be well suited for this kind of sources. We
calculate also the final mass distribution function of single black holes.

recurrent nova U Scorpii in order to resolve the existing distance discrepancy

consists of a very massive white dwarf (WD), an accretion disk (ACDK) with a
flaring-up rim, and a lobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (MS).
The model properly includes an accretion luminosity of the WD, a viscous
luminosity of the ACDK, a reflection effect of the MS and the ACDK irradiated
by the WD photosphere. The B light curve is well reproduced by a model of 1.37
M_sun WD + 1.5 M_sun MS (0.8---2.0 M_sun MS is acceptable) with an ACDK having
a flaring-up rim, and the inclination angle i~80 degree. The calculated color
is rather blue (B-V~0.0) for a suggested mass accretion rate of 2.5 x 10^{-7}
M_sun yr^{-1}, thus indicating a large color excess of E(B-V)~0.56 with the
observational color of B-V=0.56 in quiescence. Such a large color excess
corresponds to an absorption of A_V~1.8 and A_B~2.3, which reduces the distance
to 6-8 kpc. This is in good agreement with the distance estimation of 4-6 kpc
for the latest outburst. Such a large intrinsic absorption is very consistent
with the recently detected period change of U Sco, which is indicating a mass
outflow of ~3 x 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1} through the outer Lagrangian points in

rich, and the uniform picture of a decade ago has been replaced by several
correlations which connect the maximum luminosity with light curve shape, color
evolution, spectral appearance, and host galaxy morphology. These correlations
hold across almost the complete spectrum of Type Ia Supernovae, with a number
of notable exceptions. After 150 days past maximum, however, all observed
objects show the same decline rate and spectrum. Bolometric light curves are a
handy tool to investigate the overall appearance of Type Ia Supernovae. The
nickel masses derived this way show large variations, which combined with the
dynamics from line widths, indicate that the brighter events are also coming
from more massive objects. The lack of accurate distances and the uncertainty

in these areas are vital for the detailed comparison of luminosities and the

several compact components within a 0.2"" radius and a fainter asymmetric
nebula. The brightest four components are denoted with A to D in the order of
decreasing brightness in the 1996 image. A comparison of our images from 1995,
1996, 1997, and 1998 gives - almost like a movie of five frames - insight into
the dynamical evolution of the inner nebula. For instance, the separation of
the two brightest components A and B increased from 191 mas in 1995 to 265 mas
in 1998. At the same time, component B is fading and the components C and D
become brighter. The X-shaped bipolar structure of the nebula, most prominently
present in the J-band image, implies an asymmetric mass loss. Such asymmetries
are often present in protoplanetary nebulae but are unexpected for AGB stars.
IRC +10216 is thus likely to be very advanced in its AGB evolution, shortly
before turning into a protoplanetary nebula. The cometary shapes of A in the H
and J images and in the 0.79 micron and 1.06 micron HST images suggest that the
core of A is not the central star, but the southern lobe of a bipolar
structure. The position of the central star is probably at or near the position
of component B, where the H-K color has a value of 4.2. If the star is at or
near B, then the components A, C, and D are likely to be located at the inner
boundary of the dust shell.

interaction matrix elements systematically reduce the ground-state
magnetization. When the interaction dominates, the occurence of a non-zero
ground-state magnetization depends on the ratio $\lambda$ between average
exchange energy and the fluctuation amplitude of the off-diagonal matrix
elements, and a nonzero critical value $\lambda_c$ is necessary to magnetize
the ground-state. We extend these results by numerical studies of $\lambda$ for
standard tight-binding models which indicate a regime of intermediate disorder
where off-diagonal fluctuations should play an important role for ground-state
magnetization. We also emphasize the presence of strong correlations between
minimal eigenvalues of different magnetization blocks which further reduce the
probability of a nonzero ground-state spin.

the frequency $\omega$ and the amplitude of the ac perturbation, both divided

stability parameter. We also performed a simulation and found a local stability

Program Calculus is used to generate programs to (1) Determine if one number is
a factor of another. (2) List all employees who earn more than their manager.
(3) List the set of programs that halt no on themselves, thus proving that it

not halt yes on themselves is not recursively enumerable is formalized as a
program requirement that has no solution, an Incompleteness Axiom. Thus, any
axioms (programs) which could be used to generate this program are themselves
unattainable. Such proofs are presented to formally generate several additional
theorems, including (4) The halting problem is unsolvable.
  Open problems and future research is discussed, including the use of
temporary sort files, programs that calculate statistics (such as counts and

  MOO is a novel application of data mining to online optimization. The idea is
to mine (logged) expert decisions or the offline optimum for rules that can be
used for online decisions. It requires little knowledge about the task
distribution and cost structure, and is applicable to a wide range of problems.
  This paper presents a feasibility study of the methodology for the well-known

recast as classification of the optimum decisions; the resulting heuristic can
achieve the optimum for strong request patterns, consistently outperforms other
heuristics for weak patterns, and is robust despite changes in cost model.

at Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, New York in June, 1984, and was organized
by Ray Reiter and Bonnie Webber.
  In the last 10 years the area of nonmonotonic reasoning has seen a number of
important developments. Significant theoretical advances were made in the
understanding of general abstract principles underlying nonmonotonicity. Key
results on the expressibility and computational complexity of nonmonotonic
logics were established. The role of nonmonotonic reasoning in belief revision,
abduction, reasoning about action, planing and uncertainty was further
clarified. Several successful NMR systems were built and used in applications
such as planning, scheduling, logic programming and constraint satisfaction.
  The papers in the proceedings reflect these recent advances in the field.
They are grouped into sections corresponding to special sessions as they were
held at the workshop:
  1. General NMR track

splitting in strong magnetic fields traditionally have employed either the
effective Lagrangian method or variants of Schwinger's proper-time technique.
Recently, Mentzel, Berg and Wunner (1994) presented an alternative derivation
via an S-matrix formulation in the Landau representation. Advantages of such a
formulation include the ability to compute rates near pair resonances above
pair threshold. This paper presents new developments of the Landau
representation formalism as applied to photon splitting, providing significant
advances beyond the work of Mentzel et al. by summing over the spin quantum
numbers of the electron propagators, and analytically integrating over the
component of momentum of the intermediate states that is parallel to field. The
ensuing tractable expressions for the scattering amplitudes are satisfyingly
compact, and of an appearance familiar to S-matrix theory applications. Such
developments can facilitate numerical computations of splitting considerably
both below and above pair threshold. Specializations to two regimes of interest
are obtained, namely the limit of highly supercritical fields and the domain
where photon energies are far inferior to that for the threshold of
single-photon pair creation. In particular, for the first time the
low-frequency amplitudes are simply expressed in terms of the Gamma function,
its integral and its derivatives. In addition, the equivalence of the
asymptotic forms in these two domains to extant results from effective
Lagrangian/proper-time formulations is demonstrated.

$\gamma_+(\ve)$ of the Riemann-Hilbert decomposition
$\gamma_-(\ve)^{-1}\gamma_+(\ve)$ of the loop $\gamma(\ve)\in G$ provided by
dimensional regularization. We show in this paper that the group $G$ acts
naturally on the complex space $X$ of dimensionless coupling constants of the
theory. More precisely, the formula $g_0=gZ_1Z_3^{-3/2}$ for the effective
coupling constant, when viewed as a formal power series, does define a Hopf
algebra homomorphism between the Hopf algebra of coordinates on the group of
formal diffeomorphisms to the Hopf algebra ${\cal H}$. This allows first of all
to read off directly, without using the group $G$, the bare coupling constant
and the renormalized one from the Riemann-Hilbert decomposition of the
unrenormalized effective coupling constant viewed as a loop of formal
diffeomorphisms. This shows that renormalization is intimately related with the
theory of non-linear complex bundles on the Riemann sphere of the dimensional
regularization parameter $\ve$. It also allows to lift both the renormalization
group and the $\beta$-function as the asymptotic scaling in the group $G$. This
exploits the full power of the Riemann-Hilbert decomposition together with the
invariance of $\gamma_-(\ve)$ under a change of unit of mass. This not only
gives a conceptual proof of the existence of the renormalization group but also
delivers a scattering formula in the group $G$ for the full higher pole

studied both from mathematical and applied viewpoints. Casimir operators of the

unitary irreducible representations under the assumption that the number
operator spectrum is nondegenerate. Deformed algebras admitting Casimir
operators analogous to those of their undeformed counterparts are looked for,

its bosonic Fock-space representation, the realization of
$C_{\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebras as generalized deformed oscillator
ones is shown to provide a bosonization of several variants of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics: parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of order $p =

orthosupersymmetric quantum mechanics of order two for $\lambda=3$.

given by Elrifai-Morton in 1994 and by the authors in 1998. Both solutions
yield two conjugacy class invariants which are known as `inf' and `sup'. A
problem which was left unsolved in both papers was the number m of times one
must `cycle' (resp. `decycle') in order to increase inf (resp. decrease sup) or
to be sure that it is already maximal (resp. minimal) for the given conjugacy
class. Our main result is to prove that m is bounded above by n-2 in the
situation of the second algorithm and by ((n^2-n)/2)-1 in the situation of the
first. As a corollary, we show that the computation of inf and sup is
polynomial in both word length and braid index, in both algorithms. The
integers inf and sup determine (but are not determined by) the shortest
geodesic length for elements in a conjugacy class, as defined by Charney, and
so we also obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for computing this geodesic
