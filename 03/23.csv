giants is derived and then used to measure the distance to the Galactic center.
These Hipparcos red clump giants have been previously employed as I-band
standard candles. The advantage of the K-band is a decreased sensitivity to
reddening, and perhaps also a reduced systematic dependence on metallicity. In
order to investigate the latter, and also to refer our calibration to a known
metallicity zero-point, we restrict our sample of red clump calibrators to
those with abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data. The mean
metallicity of the sample is [Fe/H] = -0.18 dex. The data are consistent with
no correlation between M_K and [Fe/H], and only weakly constrain the slope of
this relation. The luminosity function of the sample peaks at M_K = -1.61 +-
0.03 mag. Next, we assemble published optical and near-infrared photometry for
about 20 red clump giants in a Baade's Window field with a mean metallicity
nearly identical to that of the Hipparcos red clump. We derive the distance to
the Galactic center: R = 8.24 +- 0.42 kpc. The uncertainty in this distance
measurement is dominated by the small number of Baade's Window red clump giants
examined here [abridged].

evolution, new stellar atmosphere models for massive stars, and a starburst
model geometry derived from observations of the prototypical starburst M82, we
model the integrated mid-infrared line ratio [NeIII](15.6 microns)/[NeII](12.8
microns). This line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the stellar energy
distribution and therefore to the most massive stars present.
  We conclude from our models, with consideration of recent determinations of
the stellar census in local, high-mass star forming regions, that the
[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios we measure are consistent with the formation of massive
(~50-100 solar mass) stars in most starbursts. In this framework, the low
nebular excitation inferred from the measured line ratios can be attributed to
aging effects. By including estimates of the ratio of infrared-to-Lyman
continuum luminosity for the galaxies in our sample, we further find that most
starbursts are relatively short-lived (1-10 million years), only a few O-star
lifetimes. We discuss a possible cause of such short events: the effectiveness
of stellar winds and supernovae in destroying the starburst environment.

centres of 8 low-redshift Abell clusters. Some 320 galaxies were surveyed, of
which 116 were detected in emission (39% of spirals, 75% of peculiars).
Detected emission was classified as `compact' or `diffuse'. From an analysis of
the full survey sample, we reconfirm our previous identification of compact and
diffuse emission with circumnuclear starburst and disk emission respectively.
The circumnuclear emission is associated either with the presence of a bar, or
with a disturbed galaxy morphology indicative of on-going tidal interactions.
The frequency of such tidally-induced (circumnuclear) starburst emission in
spirals increases from regions of lower to higher local galaxy surface density,
and from clusters with lower to higher central galaxy space density. We
conclude that tidal interactions are likely to be the main mechanism for the
transformation of spirals to S0s in clusters. Finally, for regions of
comparable local density, the frequency of tidally-induced starburst emission
is greater in clusters with higher central galaxy density. This implies that,
for a given local density, morphological transformation of disk galaxies
proceeds more rapidly in clusters of higher central galaxy density. This effect
is considered to be due to subcluster merging and could account for the
previously considered anomalous absence of a significant type - local surface
density relation for irregular clusters at intermediate redshift.

SED of Seyfert galaxies can be explained solely through thermal reradiation of
high energy photons by dust, and that this thermal emission is made up of two
or three different independent components, a warm, a cold and a very cold dust
component. These thermal components have been readily explained as produced
respectively by warm dust heated by either the active nucleus or by
circumnuclear starburts, cold dust heated by star forming region in the galaxy
disk, and very cold dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field.
Comparisons between the parameters obtained from the analysis of the IR SEDs

the Big Bang the viscous Schwarz scale L_SV matched the horizon scale L_H at
proto-galaxy-supercluster masses, decreasing to proto-galaxy fragments at

the evolution equations in a hyperbolic form, which is not the case for the
Einstein field equations in their original form. We show that the perturbation
equations can always be written in terms of spacetime variables only,
regardless of any particular gauge. We demonstrate how to obtain the
Regge-Wheeler gauge, by choosing appropriate lapse and shift. In addition, not
only the 3-metric but also the extrinsic curvature of the initial slice have to
satisfy certain conditions in order to preserve the Regge-Wheeler gauge
throughout the evolution. We discuss various forms of the equations and show
their relation to the formulation of Allen et al. New results are presented for
polytropic equations of state. An interesting phenomenon occurs in very compact
stars, where the first ring-down phase in the wave signal corresponds to the
first quasinormal mode of an equal mass black hole, rather than to one of the
proper quasinormal modes of the stellar model. A somewhat heuristic explanation
to account for this phenomenon is given. For realistic equations of state, the
numerical evolutions exhibit an instability, which does not occur for
polytropic equations of state. We show that this instability is related to the
behavior of the sound speed at the neutron drip point. As a remedy, we devise a
transformation of the radial coordinate $r$ inside the star, which removes this
instability and yields stable evolutions for any chosen numerical resolution.

quark, to probe the Standard Model and to search for physics `beyond the

the b quark is such a useful probe. I then discuss three topics of current

the action, which are established self-consistently, are defined for two cases,
mean link tadpoles in Landau gauge and gauge invariant mean plaquette tadpoles.
Parameters in the latter case exhibited no dependence on the spatial lattice
size, L, while in the former, parameters showed only a weak dependence on L
easily extrapolated to L=\infty.
  The renormalized anisotropy \chi_R was measured using both the torelon
dispersion relation and the sideways potential method. We found good agreement
between these different approaches. Any discrepancy was at worst 3-4% which is
consistent with the effect of lattice artifacts that for the torelon we
estimate as O(\a_Sa_s^2/R^2) where R is the flux-tube radius.
  We also present some new data that suggests that rotational invariance is
established more accurately for the mean-link action than the plaquette action.

supersymmetric couplings and the overall supersymmetry breaking mass scale.
Flavour changing neutral currents can be naturally highly suppressed. A
specific model predicts tan beta=4.2+/-1.0. Excluding sleptons, the
supersymmetric particle spectrum then depends upon two remaining free
parameters. In the case of the R-parity violating couplings set at their
quasi-fixed points at a supersymmetric GUT scale, the whole sparticle spectrum
approximately depends upon only one free parameter. Imposing experimental
limits leads to a constrained and distinctive phenomenology. The lightest
CP-even Higgs of mass m_h=118 GeV would be seen at the Tevatron. All sparticles

triangulation with extra combinatorial structure: a choice of transverse
orientation on each ideal 2-simplex, satisfying two simple conditions. The aim
of this paper is to demonstrate that taut ideal triangulations are very common,
and that their behaviour is very similar to that of a taut foliation. For
example, by studying normal surfaces in taut ideal triangulations, we give a
new proof of Gabai's result that the singular genus of a knot in the 3-sphere
is equal to its genus.

will consistently model linear dynamics as the grid spacing becomes small.
Using such tools of dynamical systems theory gives new assurances about the
quality of finite difference models under nonlinear and other perturbations on
grids with finite spacing. For example, the advection-diffusion equation is
found to be stably modelled for all advection speeds and all grid spacing. The
theorems establish an extremely good form for the artificial internal boundary
conditions that need to be introduced to apply centre manifold theory. When
numerically solving nonlinear partial differential equations, this approach can
be used to derive systematically finite difference models which automatically
have excellent characteristics. Their good performance for finite grid spacing
implies that fewer grid points may be used and consequently there will be less
difficulties with stiff rapidly decaying modes in continuum problems.

of cells is implicitly defined. As examples, we also give some known structures
in terms of $\omega$-hypergraphs. Then we specify a special type of
$\omega$-hypergraph, namely directed $\omega$-hypergraphs, which are made of
cells with direction. Finally, besed on them, we construct our weak
$\omega$-categories. It is an $\omega$-dimensional variant of the weak
n-categoreis given by Baez and Dolan. We introduce $\omega$-identical,
$\omega$-invertible and $\omega$-universal cells instead of universality and
balancedness of Baez-Dolan. The whole process of our definition is in parallel
with the way of regarding categories as graphs with composition and identities.

external periodic perturbation. Experimental observations and numerical studies
of reaction-diffusion systems and an analysis of an amplitude equation are
presented. The oscillations in each of these systems entrain to rational
multiples of the perturbation frequency for certain values of the forcing
frequency and amplitude. We focus on the subharmonic resonant case where the
system locks at one fourth the driving frequency, and four-phase rotating
spiral patterns are observed at low forcing amplitudes. The spiral patterns are
studied using an amplitude equation for periodically forced oscillating
systems. The analysis predicts a bifurcation (with increasing forcing) from
rotating four-phase spirals to standing two-phase patterns. This bifurcation is
also found in periodically forced reaction-diffusion equations, the
FitzHugh-Nagumo and Brusselator models, even far from the onset of oscillations
where the amplitude equation analysis is not strictly valid. In a
Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical system periodically forced with light we also
observe four-phase rotating spiral wave patterns. However, we have not observed
the transition to standing two-phase patterns, possibly because with increasing
light intensity the reaction kinetics become excitable rather than oscillatory.

consisting of the field-theoretical $s$- and $u$-channel nucleon, Roper, Delta,

to the $\pi N$ phase-shift data of the KH80 and SM95 partial-wave analyses in
the region up to 600 MeV pion kinetic energy. The resulting on-shell solution
provides a good description of the $\pi N$ scattering lengths, as well as the
energy behavior of the S, P, and D partial waves. The sensitivity of the phase
shifts on various model-dependent effects is examined.

electric breakdown in a micron-size region near the bubble and consider the
scenario of the SBSL. The scenario is: (i) at the last stage of incomplete
collapse of the bubble the gradient of pressure in water near the bubble
surface has such a value and sign that the electric field arising from the
flexoelectric effect exceeds the threshold field of the dynamic electrical
breakdown of water and is directed to the bubble center; (ii) mobile electrons
are generated because of thermal ionization of water molecules near the bubble
surface; (iii) these electrons are accelerated in ''cold'' water by the strong
electric fields; (iv) these hot electrons transfer noble gas atoms dissolved in
water to high-energy excited states and optical transitions between these
states produce SBSL UV flashes in the trasparency window of water; (v) the
breakdown can be repeated several times and the power and duration of the UV
flash are determined by the multiplicity of the breakdowns. The SBSL spectrum
is found to resemble a black-body spectrum where temperature is given by the
effective temperature of the hot electrons. The pulse energy and some other
characteristics of the SBSL are found to be in agreement with the experimental

(L-slice) discretization of the imaginary-time axis. In the auxiliary-field
method, the L-slice approximant to the density matrix can be evaluated as a
function of inverse temperature at any finite L as
$\rho_L(\beta)=[\rho_1(\beta/L)]^L$, if the density matrix $\rho_1(\beta)$ in
the static approximation is known. We investigate the convergence of the
partition function $Z_L(\beta)=Tr\rho_L(\beta)$, the internal energy and the
density of states $g_L(E)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of $Z_L$), as
$L\to\infty$. For the simple harmonic oscillator, $g_L(E)$ is a normalized
truncated Fourier series for the exact density of states. When the
auxiliary-field approach is applied to spin systems, approximants to the
density of states and heat capacity can be negative. Approximants to the
density matrix for a spin-1/2 dimer are found in closed form for all L by
appending a self-interaction to the divergent Gaussian integral and
analytically continuing to zero self-interaction. Because of this continuation,
the coefficient of the singlet projector in the approximate density matrix can
be negative. For a spin dimer, $Z_L$ is an even function of the coupling
constant for L<3: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling can be
distinguished only for $L\ge 3$, where a Berry phase appears in the functional
integral. At any non-zero temperature, the exact partition function is
recovered as $L\to\infty$.
