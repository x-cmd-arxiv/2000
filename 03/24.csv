bispectrum Q of the cosmological mass density field. The model is based on
physical properties of dark matter halos, with the three main model inputs
being analytic halo density profiles, halo mass functions, and halo-halo
spatial correlations, each of which has been well studied in the literature. We
demonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum
computed from cosmological simulations of both an n=-2 scale-free model and a
low-density cold dark matter model. To enhance the dynamic range of these large
simulations, we use the synthetic halo replacement technique of Ma & Fry
(2000a), where the original halos with numerically softened cores are replaced
by synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high wavenumbers, our
model predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from the
often-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable clustering
assumption. Our model also predicts a three-point amplitude Q that is scale
dependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This
model provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrum
over all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. It also
provides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in
the universe.

calculations of matter clustering no longer apply. We build on these studies in

In particular, we study the full probability distribution function, bias and
other multipoint statistics for the ``hot spots'' of the convergence field
induced by weak lensing, and relate these to the statistics of overdense
regions in underlying mass distribution. It is already known that weak lensing
can constrain the background geometry of the Universe, but we further show that
it can also provide valuable information about the statistics of collapsed

morphological type and luminosity? We address this question in the mathematical
framework of marked point processes and clarify the notion of luminosity and
morphological segregation. A number of test quantities such as conditional
mark-weighted two-point correlation functions are introduced. These descriptors
allow for a scale-dependent analysis of luminosity and morphology segregation.
Moreover, they break the degeneracy between an inhomogeneous fractal point set
and actual present luminosity segregation. Using the Southern Sky Redshift
Survey~2 (da Costa et al. 1998, SSRS2) we find both luminosity and
morphological segregation at a high level of significance, confirming claims by
previous works using these data (Benoist et al. 1996, Willmer et al. 1998).
Specifically, the average luminosity and the fluctuations in the luminosity of
pairs of galaxies are enhanced out to separations of 15Mpc/h. On scales smaller
than 3Mpc/h the luminosities on galaxy pairs show a tight correlation. A
comparison with the random-field model indicates that galaxy luminosities
depend on the spatial distribution and galaxy-galaxy interactions. Early-type
galaxies are also more strongly correlated, indicating morphological
segregation. The galaxies in the PSCz catalog (Saunders et al. 2000) do not
show significant luminosity segregation. This again illustrates that mainly
early-type galaxies contribute to luminosity segregation. However, based on
several independent investigations we show that the observed luminosity
segregation can not be explained by the morphology-density relation alone.

disk galaxies may be density bounded, so that a significant fraction of the
ionizing photons emitted by their exciting OB stars escape from the regions.
The key piece of evidence is the presence, in the H\alpha luminosity functions
(LFs) of the populations of HII regions, of glitches, local sharp peaks at an
apparently invariant luminosity, defined as the Stromgren luminosity (L_ Str),
L_H\alpha = L_Str = 10^38.6 (\pm 10^0.1) erg/s (no other peaks are found in any
of the LFs) accompanying a steepening of slope for L_H\alpha> L_Str. This
behavior is readily explicable via a physical model whose basic premises are:
(a) the transition at L_H\alpha = L_Str marks a change from essentially
ionization bounding at low luminosities to density bounding at higher values,
(b) for this to occur the law relating stellar mass in massive star-forming
clouds to the mass of the placental cloud must be such that the ionizing photon
flux produced within the cloud is a function which rises more steeply than the
mass of the cloud. Supporting evidence for the hypothesis of this transition is
presented. If confirmed, the density-bounding hypothesis would imply that the
density-bounded regions were the main sources of the photons which ionize the
diffuse gas in disk galaxies. We estimate that these regions emit sufficient
Lyman continuum not only to ionize the diffuse medium, but to cause a typical
spiral to emit significant ionizing flux into the intergalactic medium. The low
scatter observed in L_Str, less than 0.1 mag rms in the still quite small
sample measured to date, is an invitation to widen the data base, and to
calibrate against primary standards, with the aim of obtaining a precise
standard candle.

association of gamma-ray bursts with type Ibc supernovae leads us to consider
massive helium stars that form black holes at the end of their lives as
progenitors. We combine the numerical work of MacFadyen & Woosley with analytic
calculations, to show that about 1E53 erg each are available to drive the fast
GRB ejecta and the supernova. The GRB ejecta are driven by the power output
through the open field lines, whereas the supernova is powered by closed filed
lines and jet shocks. We also present a much simplified approximate derivation
of these energetics.
  Helium stars that leave massive black-hole remnants in special ways, namely
via soft X-ray transients or very massive WNL stars. Since binaries naturally
have high angular momentum, we propose a link between black-hole transients and
gamma-ray bursts. Recent observations of one such transient, GRO J1655-40/Nova
Scorpii 1994, explicitly support this connection: its high space velocity
indicates that substantial mass was ejected in the formation of the black hole,
and the overabundance of alpha-nuclei, especially sulphur, indicates that the

flux and polarization. We make the assumption that such variability is caused
by the presence of regions of enhanced density, i.e. blobs, in their envelopes.
In order to find the physical characteristics of such regions we have modeled
the stellar emission using a Monte Carlo code to treat the radiative transfer
in an inhomogeneous electron scattering envelope. We are able to treat multiple
scattering in the regions of enhanced density as well as in the envelope
itself. The finite sizes of the source and structures in the wind are also
taken into account. Most of the results presented here are based on a parameter
study of models with a single blob. The effects due to multiple blobs in the
envelope are considered to a more limited extent. Our simulations indicate that
the density enhancements must have a large geometric cross section in order to
produce the observed photopolarimetric variability. The sizes must be of the
order of one stellar radius and the blobs must be located near the base of the
envelope. These sizes are the same inferred from the widths of the sub-peaks in
optical emission lines of Wolf-Rayet stars. Other early-type stars show random
polarimetric fluctuations with characteristics similar to those observed in
Wolf-Rayet stars, which may also be interpreted in terms of a clumpy wind.
Although the origin of such structures is still unclear, the same mechanism may
be working in different types of hot stars envelopes to produce such
inhomogeneities.

  Accepted in Anales de F\'{\i}sica",,,,"astro-ph",,"  There are at present more then 30 theories about the origin of cosmic
magnetic fields at galactic and intergalactic scales. Most of them rely on
concepts of elementary particle physics, like phase transitions in the early
Universe, string theory and processes during the inflationary epoch. Here we
present some more astrophysical arguments to provide some guidance through this
large number and variety of models. Especially the fact that the evolution of
magnetic fields depends on the spatial coherence scale of the fields leds to
some interesting conclusions, which may rule out the majority of the
theoretical scenarios. In principle one has to distinguish between the
large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields. Large scale fields are defined as
those as becoming sub-horizon at that redshift at which the mass energy density
becomes equal to the photon energy density, which we name as equality. Small
scale fields which are sub-horizon even before equality, i.e. with scales lower
than (present) few Mpc cannot survive the radiation era and cannot reach
recombination, because of the effects of magnetic diffusion and photon
diffusion. Therefore mechanisms based on phase transitions become unlike, as
they provide magnetic fields on scales smaller than the horizon. Thus, the
observed galactic and intergalactic fields, which are small scales in our
terminology must be created after recombination by normal plasma processes
during the protogalactic evolution. The large scale fields instead were
produced during inflation and may have noticeable implications for the
formation of the large scale structure of the Universe. The inclusion of large
scale magnetic fields may improve present Cold Dark Matter theories of
structure formation.

larger than the pairing scattering rate. In the presence of an AC voltage, the
tunnelling current noise shows a series of characteristic peaks with increasing
DC voltage. Experimental observation of these peaks will give direct evidence
of the pair fluctuation in the normal state of high-$T_c$ superconductors and
from the half width of the peaks the pair decay rate can be estimated.

monotonically with distance, as it does in one dimension, but has some
oscillations, reflecting the greater geometrical complexity of the lattice in
the higher dimensions. In addition to the strong attraction at short distances,
there is now also a local minimum in the potential of depth about $kT$ at a

The rest of the generators in the group, L_n (n>1, n<-1), mix space-times with
different constant curvature. Only in the classical limit all space-times can
be identified, defining a unique Minkowski space-time, and the operators L_n
(n<1, n<-1) gauged away. This process entails a restriction to SL(2,R)
subrepresentations, which creates a non-trivial two-dimensional symplectic

supergravity (SUGRA) and gauge mediated (GM) contributions to MSSM scalar and
gaugino masses are comparable - this enables a realistic spectrum to be
attained since GM contribution to the right-handed (RH) slepton (mass)^2 by
itself (i.e., neglecting SUGRA contribution to sfermion {\em and} gaugino
masses) is negative. But, in general, the SUGRA contribution to sfermion masses
(from non-renormalizable contact K\""ahler terms) leads to flavor violation. In
this paper, we use the recently proposed idea of gaugino mediated SUSY breaking
(\tilde{g}MSB) to improve the above model. With MSSM matter and SUSY breaking
fields localized on separate branes in an extra dimension of size R \sim 5
M^{-1}_{Pl} (in which gauge fields propagate), the SUGRA contribution to
sfermion masses (which violates flavor) is suppressed. As in 4 dimensions, MSSM
gauginos acquire {\em non}-universal masses from both SUGRA and GM - gaugino
masses (in particular the SUGRA contribution to gaugino masses), in turn,
generate acceptable sfermion masses through RG evolution; the phenomenology is
discussed briefly. We also point out that a) in models where SUSY is broken by
a GUT non-singlet field, there is, in general, a contribution to MSSM gaugino
(and scalar) masses from the coupling to heavy gauge multiplet which {\em
might} be {\em comparable} to the SUGRA contribution and b) models of GM

QCD coupling and observables in the time-like region with fresh results on the
""analyticized"" coupling $\alpha_{\rm an}(Q^2)$ and observables in the
space-like domain we formulate a self-consistent scheme, free of ghost
troubles. The basic point of this joint construction is the ""dipole spectral

heavy quark thresholds and devise a global scheme for the data analysis in the
whole accessible space-like and time-like domain with various numbers of active
quarks. Observables in both the regions are presented in a form of non-power
perturbation series with improved convergence properties. Preliminary estimates
indicate that this global scheme produces results a bit different - on a few
per cent level for $\bar{\alpha}_s$ - from the usual one, thus influencing the

sensitivity. The temperature dependence of $F$ strongly suggests that a reduced
number of degrees of freedom contributes to the free energy in the non-planar
sector, $F_{\rm np}$, at high temperature. This phenomenon seems generic,
independent of the UV sensitivity, and can be traced to modes whose thermal
wavelengths become smaller than the noncommutativity scale. The temperature
dependence of $F_{\rm np}$ can then be calculated at high temperature using
classical statistical mechanics, without encountering a UV catastrophe even in
large number of dimensions. This result is a telltale sign of the low number of
degrees of freedom contributing to $F$ in the non-planar sector at high
temperature. Such behavior is in marked contrast to what would happen in a

typical use of such a grating involves an incident electromagnetic wave with

an incident plane electromagnetic wave with wave vector in the y-z plane and
polarization in the x direction: We show that for small ripples, this leads to
a reflected wave plus two surface waves that are attenuated exponentially with
z. For certain values of the grating wavelength and the optical wavelength, the
component of the phase velocity of the surface waves is the speed of light c.
In this case, a charged particle moving with v_x ~ c could extract energy from
the wave, which is the principle of the ""grating accelerator"".
