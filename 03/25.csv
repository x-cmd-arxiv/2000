  clarification",,"10.1086/317098",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the angular momentum transport properties of disks composed of
macroscopic particles whose velocity dispersions are externally enhanced
(``stirred''). Our simple Boltzmann equation model serves as an analogy for
unmagnetized fluid disks in which turbulence may be driven by thermal
convection. We show that interparticle collisions in particle disks play the
same role as fluctuating pressure forces and viscous dissipation in turbulent
disks: both transfer energy in random motions associated with one direction to
those associated with another, and convert kinetic energy into heat. The
direction of angular momentum transport in stirred particle and fluid disks is
determined by the direction of external stirring and by the properties of the
collision term in the Boltzmann equation (or its analogue in the fluid
problem). In particular, our model problem yields inward transport for
vertically or radially stirred disks, provided collisions are suitably
inelastic; the transport is outwards in the elastic limit. Numerical
simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence driven by thermal convection find inward
transport; this requires that fluctuating pressure forces do little to no work,
and is analogous to an externally stirred particle disk in which collisions are
highly inelastic.

light curve observed in the V, R and I bands during the first ~35 days after

the optical transient (OT), plus an additional component which was treated in
two different ways. First, the additional component was assumed to be an
underlying galaxy of constant brightness. The resulting slope of the decay is
0.97+/-0.05 and the magnitudes of the underlying galaxy are: V = 22.3 +/- 0.05,
R = 21.75 +/- 0.05 and I = 21.35 +/- 0.05. Second, the additional component was
assumed to be a galaxy plus an underlying supernova with a time-variable
brightness identical to that of GRB980425, appropriately scaled to the redshift
of GRB990712. The resulting slope of the decay is similar, but the
goodness-of-fit is worse which would imply that either this GRB is not
associated with an underlying supernova or the underlying supernova is much
fainter than the supernova associated with GRB980425. The galaxy in this case
is fainter: V = 22.7 +/- 0.05, R = 22.25 +/- 0.05 and I = 22.15 +/- 0.05; and
the OT plus the underlying supernova at a given time is brighter. Measurements
of the brightnesses of the OT and the galaxy by late-time HST observation and
ground-based observations can thus assess the presence of an underlying

is a generalization of previous formulations to include a density gradient in
the pre-shock ambient medium, as well as anisotropy in the pre-shock wind. For
cases where the wind is unaccelerated, the formalism yields exact, analytic
solutions.
  Solutions are presented for two bow shock cases: (1) that due to a star
moving supersonically with respect to an ambient medium with a density gradient
perpendicular to the stellar velocity, and (2) that due to a star with a
misaligned, axisymmetric wind moving in a uniform medium. It is also shown
under quite general circumstances that the total rate of energy thermalization
in the bow shock is independent of the details of the wind asymmetry, including
the orientation of the non-axisymmetric driving wind, provided the wind is
non-accelerating and point-symmetric. A typical feature of the solutions is
that the region near the standoff point is tilted, so that the star does not
lie along the bisector of a parabolic fit to the standoff region. The principal
use of this work is to infer the origin of bow shock asymmetries, whether due
to the wind or ambient medium, or both.

toward the LMC some 13-17 microlensing events have been observed by the MACHO

is an accurate determination of the survey's detection efficiency. The
detection efficiency is a complicated function of temporal sampling, stellar
crowding (the luminosity function), image quality, photometry, time-series
analysis, and criteria used to select the microlensing candidates. Such a

hopping between localized tail states has been developed. It allows us to
consider both charge and energy {\it dispersive} transport. The method is based
on the idea of quasi-elasticity: the typical energy loss during a hop is much
less than all other characteristic energies. We have investigated two models
with different density of states energy dependencies with our method. In
general, we have found that the motion of a packet in energy space is affected
by two competing tendencies. First, there is a packet broadening, i.e. the
dispersive energy transport. Second, there is a narrowing of the packet, if the
density of states is depleting with decreasing energy. It is the interplay of
these two tendencies that determines the overall evolution. If the density of
states is constant, only broadening exists. In this case a packet in energy
space evolves into Gaussian one, moving with constant drift velocity and mean
square deviation increasing linearly in time. If the density of states depletes
exponentially with decreasing energy, the motion of the packet tremendously
slows down with time. For large times the mean square deviation of the packet
becomes constant, so that the motion of the packet is ``soliton-like''.

10 mK. Below this temperature, p-wave triplet superconductivity emerges around

  Journal",,,,"cs.AI cs.PL",,"  We study here a natural situation when constraint programming can be entirely
reduced to rule-based programming. To this end we explain first how one can
compute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple
first-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that
are based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first
derive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation
process to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling.We
consider here two types of rules. The first type, that we call equality rules,
leads to a new notion of local consistency, called {\em rule consistency} that
turns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity
(called hyper-arc consistency in \cite{MS98b}). For Boolean constraints rule
consistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules
for Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership
rules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show
feasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming we show how
both types of rules can be automatically generated, as {\tt CHR} rules of
\cite{fruhwirth-constraint-95}. This yields an implementation of this approach
to programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate the
usefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various
examples, including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued
logics, constraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedral
scenes, and Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.

paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and
combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with
an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints.
However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive
closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large
theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such
problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as
stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently
and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their
semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this
paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC.
Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of
Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of
the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the
system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the
syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an
implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the
effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and
SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is
competitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems,
often yielding much more efficient solutions.

SO(10) supersymmetric grand unified model of the fermion mass matrices. Various
features of the model which gives remarkably accurate results for the quark and

construction of the matrices is first discussed in the framework of effective
operators, from which one naturally obtains the maximal \nu_\mu - \nu_\tau
mixing, while the small angle or maximal mixing solutions for the solar
neutrinos depend upon the nature of the Majorana matrix. A set of Higgs and
fermion superfields is then introduced from which the Higgs and Yukawa
superpotentials uniquely give the structure of the mass matrices previously
obtained. The right-handed Majorana matrix arises from one Higgs field coupling
to several pairs of superheavy conjugate neutrino singlets. For the simple
version considered, 10 input parameters accurately yield the 20 masses and
mixings of the quarks and leptons, and the 3 masses of the right-handed
neutrinos.

generated, unital C-algebras with homogeneous relations and a q-differential
structure. This family of algebras includes the quantum groups, or at least
those that are based on simple (super) Lie or Kac-Moody algebras. Their
classification would encompass the so far incompleted classification of
quantized (super) Kac-Moody algebras and of the (super) Kac-Moody algebras
themselves. These can be defined as singular limits of q-algebras, and it is
evident that to deal with the q-algebras in their full generality is more
rational than the examination of each singular limit separately. This is not
just because quantization unifies algebras and superalgebras, but also because
the points ""q = 1"" and ""q = -1"" are the most singular points in parameter
space. In this paper one of two major hurdles in this classification program
has been overcome. Fix a set of integers n_1,...,n_k, and consider the space
B_Q of homogeneous polynomials of degree n_1 in the generator e_1, and so on.
Assume that there are no constants among the polynomials of lower degree, in
any one of the generators; in this case all constants in the space B_Q have
been classified. The task that remains, the more formidable one, is to remove
the stipulation that there are no constants of lower degree.

years ago, Gibbons and Macklin (1959); and 26 years ago, Carlosn et al. (1973).
The calculations are found to be in reasonable agreement with these old data,
though a discrepancy is observed near the deuteron breakup threshold. Moreover,
a detailed analysis of the contributions to the observable from different
partial waves has been presented. Unexpectedly, the main contribution for a
wide range of energies has been detected in the J=3/2- state.

C61 (2000) 055202","10.1103/PhysRevC.61.055202",,"nucl-th",,"  We study the changes produced by the deuteron on the QCD quark condensate by
means the Feynman-Hellmann theorem and find that the pion mass dependence of
the pion-nucleon coupling could play an important role. We also discuss the
relation between the many body effect of the condensate and the meson exchange
currents, as seen by photons and pions. For pion probes, the many-body term in
the physical amplitude differs significantly from that of soft pions, the one
linked to the condensate. Thus no information about the many-body term of the
condensate can be extracted from the pion-deuteron scattering length. On the
other hand, in the Compton amplitude, the relationship with the condensate is a
more direct one.

cluster have been calculated in the canonical ensemble using parallel tempering
Monte Carlo methods. A distinct region of temperature is identified that
corresponds to equilibrium between the global minimum structure and the
icosahedral basin of structures. This region of temperatures occurs below the
melting peak of the heat capacity and is accompanied by a peak in the
derivative of the heat capacity with temperature. Parallel tempering is shown
to introduce correlations between results at different temperatures. A
discussion is given that compares parallel tempering with other related
approaches that ensure ergodic simulations.

Carlo methods in the microcanonical and molecular dynamics ensembles. A new
Monte Carlo algorithm is presented that samples rigorously the molecular
dynamics ensemble for a system at constant total energy, linear and angular
momenta. By combining the parallel tempering technique with molecular dynamics
methods, we develop a hybrid method to overcome quasi-ergodicity and to extract
both equilibrium and dynamical properties from Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics simulations. Several thermodynamic, structural and dynamical
properties are investigated for LJ$_{38}$, including the caloric curve, the
diffusion constant and the largest Lyapunov exponent. The importance of
insuring ergodicity in molecular dynamics simulations is illustrated by
comparing the results of ergodic simulations with earlier molecular dynamics
simulations.

electron-electron, electron-positron and electron-photon interactions if these
take place in the presence of an intense laser beam. Practical considerations
severely limit the utility of this concept for contemporary lasers incident on
relativistic electrons. A more accessible laboratory phenomenon is
electron-positron production via an intense laser beam incident on a gas.
Intense electromagnetic pulses of astrophysical origin can lead to very
energetic photons via bremsstrahlung of temporarily accelerated electrons.
