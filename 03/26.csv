accretion flows around black holes. The flows have no radiative cooling and are
treated in the framework of the hydrodynamical approximation. The models
calculated in this study cover the large range of the relevant parameter space.
There are four types of flows, determined by the values of the viscosity
parameter $\alpha$ and the adiabatic index $\gamma$: convective flows,
large-scale circulations, pure inflows and bipolar outflows. Thermal conduction
introduces significant changes to the solutions, but does not create a new flow
type. Convective accretion flows and flows with large-scale circulations have
significant outward-directed energy fluxes, which have important implications
for the spectra and luminosities of accreting black holes.

increases the volume fraction of the charged regions, while the local charge

distribution changes sharply near the superconducting transition temperature,
with stronger charge inhomogeneity below Tc. The remarkable magnitude of the
phonon response to charge suggests strong involvement of phonons in charge

  This edge barrier and the resulting irreversible magnetization loops and
flux-density profiles are computed from continuum electrodynamics for
superconductor strips and disks with constant thickness, both without and with
bulk pinning. Expressions for the field of first flux entry H_en and for the
reversibility field H_rev above which the pin-free magnetization becomes

fluctuation of the $\phi$ field can be effectively enhanced during a stage of
the oscillating inflation, the maximum fluctuation is suppressed as the
critical value $\phi_c$ which indicates the scale of the core part of the
inflaton potential decreases, in taking into account the back reaction effect
of created particles. As for the $\chi$ particle production, we find that
larger values of the coupling constant $g$ are required to lead to an efficient
parametric resonance with the decrease of $\phi_c$, because an effective mass
of inflaton around the minimum of its potential becomes larger. However, it is
possible to generate the superheavy $\chi$ particle whose mass is greater than
$10^{14}$ GeV, which would result in an important consequence for the GUT

question about the existence of dual abelian groups G which are not isomorphic
to Z+G. Recall that G is a dual group if G ~ D^* for some group D with
D^*=Hom(D,Z). The existence of such groups is not obvious because dual groups
are subgroups of cartesian products Z^D and therefore have very many
homomorphisms into Z. If p is such a homomorphism arising from a projection of
the cartesian product, then D^* ~ ker(p)+Z. In all `classical cases' of groups
D of infinite rank it turns out that D^* ~ ker(p). Is this always the case?
Also note that reflexive groups G in the sense of H.Bass are dual groups
because by definition the evaluation map s:G-->G^{**} is an isomorphism, hence
G is the dual of G^*. Assuming the diamond axiom for aleph_1 we construct a
reflexive torsion-free abelian group of cardinality aleph_1 which is not
isomorphic to Z+G. The result is formulated for modules over countable

group, which will provide a negative answer to the question. In order to derive
a stronger and also more general result we will concentrate on reflexive
modules over countable principal ideal domains R. Following H.Bass, an R-module
G is reflexive if the evaluation map s:G-->G^{**} is an isomorphism. Here
G^*=Hom(G,R) denotes the dual group of G. Guided by classical results the
question about the existence of a reflexive R-module G of infinite rank with G

theorem from [Sh:e] which allows us to avoid the weak diamond principle. This

an emitted cluster as a soliton moving on its surface. The potential barrier
against the emission of a soliton is calculated within the
macroscopic-microscopic method. The outer turning point of the barrier
determines limitations on the geometrical and kinematical parameters for the
formation of a surface soliton. For large asymmetry, the two-center shell model
is used to assign a structure to the soliton. Calculations for
$^{248}$N\lowercase{o} with the emission of a $^{40}$C\lowercase{a} soliton are
reported; likewise for $^{224}$T\lowercase{h} with the emission of $^{16}$O.
Except for necked shapes at the very first stages of soliton formation, the
greatest portion of the deformation path displays rather compact configurations
with large neck radii. These shape sequences correspond to allowable soliton
velocities. Close to and just beyond the touching point configuration, where
the shape becomes concave, the width and the velocity of the soliton approach
zero. The calculations suggest that the emission of a $^{40}$C\lowercase{a}
structure is quite probable due to a low potential barrier, whereas the
emission of an $^{16}$O type soliton is rather unlikely due to the higher
penetration barrier.
