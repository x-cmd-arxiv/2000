paper, Hjorth et al. (1999) reported an upper limit on the degree of linear
polarization of the optical afterglow for this burst (P <2.3%). One of the
interprtations for this small value of P was that the emission was probably due
a relativistic jet with ordered magnetic field, and the viewing angle in the
lab frame theta' <= Gamma^{-1}, where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor of the
jet at the time of the optical emission. We point out that this conclusion
resulted from a confusion between the angles measured in the lab frame and in
the plasma rest frame. For ordered magnetic field, one would actually obtain a
large value of P because the above mentioned angle would correspond to a very
large angle, theta <= \pi/2, in the plasma rest frame. And this is probably the
case with the blazars. On the other hand, it is indeed possible to have P ~ 0
if the magnetic field of GRB 990123 was completely chaotic and the viewing
angle was considerably smaller than the semi-angle of the jet.

magnetic fields are amplified through field line stretching at a rate
proportional to the difference between the velocity and the magnetic field
strength times a constant. Equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic
energy densities occurs at a scale somewhat smaller than the kinetic energy
peak. Above the equipartition scale the velocity structure is, as expected,
nearly isotropic. The magnetic field structure at these scales is uncertain,
but the field correlation function is very weak. At the equipartition scale the
magnetic fields show only a moderate degree of anisotropy, so that the typical
radius of curvature of field lines is comparable to the typical perpendicular
scale for field reversal. In other words, there are few field reversals within
eddies at the equipartition scale, and no fine-grained series of reversals at
smaller scales. At scales below the equipartition scale, both velocity and
magnetic structures are anisotropic; the eddies are stretched along the local
magnetic field lines, and the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy on
the same scale by a factor which increases at higher wavenumbers. We do not
show a scale-free inertial range, but the power spectra are a function of
resolution and/or the imposed viscosity and resistivity. Our results are
consistent with the emergence of a scale-free inertial range at higher Reynolds

ones. It is found that a closed system, evolving from one initial condition,
thermalizes to high precision in the thermodynamic limit, in a time-averaged
sense. For ensembles consisting of many members with the same energy, we find
that expectation values become stationary - and equal to the thermal values -
in the limit of infinitely many members. Initial ensembles with a nonzero
(noncanonical) spread in the energy density or other conserved quantities
evolve to noncanonical stationary ensembles. In the case of a narrow spread,
asymptotic values of primary observables are only mildly affected. In contrast,

the status of these generators is analyzed in a general setting. It is shown
that such operators exist in any theory and in any number of spacetime
dimensions. But in more than two dimensions they have rather delicate domain
properties in the presence of interaction. If, for example, they are defined
and temperate on a translation-invariant, dense domain, then the underlying
theory yields only trivial scattering. In two-dimensional theories, these
domain properties are consistent with non-trivial interaction, but they exclude
particle production. Thus the range of applications of polarization-free

The second 0^+ state, which has dominantly the (1/2^+)^2 configuration, is
shown to have a particularly enlarged $\alpha-\alpha$ structure. The kinetic
energy of the two valence neutrons occupying along the $\alpha-\alpha$ axis is
reduced remarkably due to the strong $\alpha$ clustering and, simultaneously,
the spin-orbit interaction unexpectedly plays important role to make the energy
of this state much lower. The mixing of states with different spin structure is
shown to be important in negative-parity states. The experimentally observed
small-level spacing between 1^- and 2^- (~ 300 keV) is found to be an evidence
of this spin-mixing effect. ^{12}{Be} is also investigated using

occupy the (3/2^-)^2(1/2^+)^2 configuration. The energy surface of ^{12}Be is

planetary atmospheres, like on Jupiter, by a general approach of statistical
mechanics of potential vorticity patches. The idea is that potential vorticity
mixing leads to the formation of a steady organized coarse grained flow,
corresponding to the statistical equilibrium state. Our starting point is the
quasi-geostrophic 1-1/2 layer model, and we consider the relevant limit of a
small Rossby radius of deformation. Then narrow jets are obtained, scaling like
the Rossby radius of deformation. These jets can be either zonal, or closed
into a ring bounding a vortex. Taking into account the effect of the beta
effect and a sublayer deep shear flow, we predict an organization of the
turbulent atmospheric layer into an oval-shaped vortex amidst a background
shear. Such an isolated vortex is centered over an extremum of the equivalent
topography (determined by the deep shear flow and beta-effect). This prediction
is in agreement with analysis of wind data in major Jovian vortices (Great Red

(| \Phi ^{\pm}> =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 00> \pm | 11>)) across ADC. We also show
that under similar dissipative interactions different Bell states give rise to
noisy entangled states that are qualitatively very different from each other in
the sense, only the noisy entangled states constructed from the Bell states (|
\Phi ^{\pm}>) can \emph{}be made better sometimes by subjecting the unaffected
qubit to a dissipative interaction with the environment. Importantly if the
noisy state is non teleporting then it can always be made teleporting with this
prescription. We derive the most general restrictions on improvement of such
noisy states assuming that the damping parameters being different for both the
qubits. However this curious prescription does not work for the noisy entangled
states generated from (| \Psi ^{\pm}> =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 01> \pm | 10>)).
This shows that an apriori knowledge of the noisy channel might be helpful to
decide which Bell state needs to be shared between Alice and Bob. \emph{}
