radiation from a blast wave produced when the relativistic ejecta encounters
the surrounding medium. We reanalyze the refreshed shock scenario, in which
slower material catches up with the decelerating ejecta and reenergizes it.
This energization can be done either continuously or in discrete episodes. We
show that such scenario has two important implications. First there is an
additional component coming from the reverse shock that goes into the
energizing ejecta. This persists for as long as the re-energization itself,
which could extend for up to days or longer. We find that during this time the
overall spectral peak is found at the characteristic frequency of the reverse
shock. Second, if the injection is continuous, the dynamics will be different
from that in constant energy evolution, and will cause a slower decline of the
observed fluxes. A simple test of the continuously refreshed scenario is that
it predicts a spectral maximum in the far IR or mm range after a few days.

fluids. Rather than deforming uniformly, materials such as dry sand or
cohesionless powders develop shear bands: narrow zones containing large
relative particle motion leaving adjacent regions essentially rigid[1,2,3,4,5].
Since shear bands mark areas of flow, material failure and energy dissipation,
they play a crucial role for many industrial, civil engineering and geophysical
processes[6]. They also appear in related contexts, such as in lubricating
fluids confined to ultra-thin molecular layers[7]. Detailed information on
motion within a shear band in a three-dimensional geometry, including the
degree of particle rotation and inter-particle slip, is lacking. Similarly,
only little is known about how properties of the individual grains - their
microstructure - affect movement in densely packed material[5]. Combining
magnetic resonance imaging, x-ray tomography, and high-speed video particle
tracking, we obtain the local steady-state particle velocity, rotation and
packing density for shear flow in a three-dimensional Couette geometry. We find
that key characteristics of the granular microstructure determine the shape of

effect. Designing in relatively mild energetic heterogeneity can eliminate the
barrier completely at the transition temperature. Sequences with native
energies tuned to fold uniformly, as well as sequences tuned to fold by a
single or a few routes, are rare. Sequences with weak native energetic
heterogeneity are more common; their folding kinetics is more strongly

(1-\Delta)$, where $\hat{S}_N(t)$ is the number of sites inside a hypersphere
of radius $R [\ln (N)/c]^{1/ u}$, R is the root-mean-square displacement of a

realizations is very broad in Euclidean space but very narrow in the chemical
or topological space. This allows us to adapt the formalism developed for
Euclidean and deterministic fractal lattices to the chemical language, and an
asymptotic series for $S_N(t)$ analogous to that found for the non-disordered

phenomenological model for supercooled liquids of Adam and Gibbs [J. Chem.
Phys. 43, 139 (1965)]. This is made possible by relating the granular
excitation parameter \Gamma, defined as the peak acceleration of the driving
pulse scaled by gravity, to a temperature-like parameter \eta(\Gamma). The
resulting master equation is formally identical to that of Bouchaud's trap
model for glasses [J. Phys. I 2, 1705 (1992)]. Analytic and simulation results
are shown to compare favourably with a range of known experimental behaviour.
This includes the logarithmic densification and power spectrum of fluctuations
under constant \eta, the annealing curve when \eta is varied cyclically in
time, and memory effects observed for a discontinuous shift in \eta. Finally,
we discuss the physical interpretation of the model parameters and suggest
further experiments for this class of systems.

proto-types that the interferometric output signal will be corrupted by a
significant amount of non-Gaussian noise, large part of it being essentially
composed of long-term sinusoids with slowly varying envelope (such as violin
resonances in the suspensions, or main power harmonics) and short-term ringdown
noise (which may emanate from servo control systems, electronics in a
non-linear state, etc.). Since non-Gaussian noise components make the detection
and estimation of the gravitational wave signature more difficult, a denoising
algorithm based on adaptive filtering techniques (LMS methods) is proposed to
separate and extract them from the stationary and Gaussian background noise.
The strength of the method is that it does not require any precise model on the
observed data: the signals are distinguished on the basis of their
autocorrelation time. We believe that the robustness and simplicity of this
method make it useful for data preparation and for the understanding of the
first interferometric data. We present the detailed structure of the algorithm

tensor on the supergravity side; the methods of Gubser, Klebanov, Polyakov, and
Witten were used. On the field theory side, we derived an explicit expression
for the two-point function in terms of data that may be extracted from the
supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization (SDLCQ) calculation at a given
harmonic resolution. This yielded a well defined numerical algorithm for
computing the two-point function. For the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with
16 supercharges that arises in the Maldacena conjecture, the algorithm is
perfectly well defined; however, the size of the numerical computation
prevented us from obtaining a numerical check of the conjecture. We now present
numerical results with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previously
considered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within
$10-15%$ of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results are
still not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be
considered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method for
using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discuss
a numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this type
of matrix element calculation.

that the two exact separable solutions previously discovered are precisely the
special cases for which the loop corrections are time-independent. Generically,
loop corrections vary with time. Moreover, for a subset of solutions they
increase in time, evolving into complicated, non-separating solutions. In this

the complex and the unique real algebra. We develop a common framework to
discuss all signatures theories by starting from the complex form of OSp(1|32).
Theories are distinguished by the choice of basis for this algebra. We
formulate dimensional reductions and dualities as changes of basis of the
algebra. A second ingredient is the choice of a real form corresponding to a
specific signature. The existence of the real form of the algebra selects
preferred spacetime signatures. In particular, we show how the real d=10 IIA
and IIB superalgebras for various signatures are related by generalized
T-duality transformations that not only involve spacelike but also timelike
directions. A third essential ingredient is that the translation generator in
one theory plays the role of a central charge operator in the other theory. The
identification of the translation generator in these algebras leads to the star
algebras of Hull, which are characterized by the fact that the positive
definite energy operator is not part of the translation generators. We apply
our results to discuss different T-dual pictures of the D-instanton solution of

non-critical, and the Liouville mode plays the role of the target time. Also,
the extra bulk dimensions are viewed as sigma model couplings, and as such have
to be averaged by appropriate summation over worldsheet genera. The recoiling
brane is in an excited state rather than its ground state, to which it relaxes
asymptotically in time, restoring supersymmetry. We also find that the
excitation energy, which is considered as the observable effective cosmological
`constant' on the brane, is naturally small and can accommodate upper bounds
from observations.

probability that the paths B[0,t] and B'[0,t] do not intersect decays like
t^{-5/8}. More precisely, there is a constant c>0 such that if |B(0) - B'(0)|
=1, for all t \ge 1, c^{-1} t^{-5/8} \le \P[ B[0,t] \cap B'[0,t] = \emptyset ]

Hausdorff dimension 3/4 almost surely. The values of other exponents are also
derived. Using an analyticity result, which is to be established in a
forthcoming paper, it follows that the Hausdorff dimension of the outer
boundary of B[0,1] is 4/3, as conjectured by Mandelbrot. The proofs are based
on a study of SLE_6 (stochastic Loewner evolution with parameter 6), a recently
discovered process which conjecturally is the scaling limit of critical
percolation cluster boundaries. The exponents of SLE_6 are calculated, and they
agree with the physicists' predictions for the exponents for critical
percolation and self-avoiding walks. From the SLE_6 exponents the Brownian
intersection exponents are then derived.

experimental results for the population decay rate of a single trapped ion
observed in the NIST experiments by Meekhof and coworkers (D. M. Meekhof, {\it
et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 1796 (1996)).

  oscillators","submitted to Phys. Rev. A","Physical Review A, VOLUME 62, 053407 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevA.62.053407",,"quant-ph",,"  Some properties of the non--linear coherent states (NCS), recognized by Vogel
and de Matos Filho as dark states of a trapped ion, are extended to NCS on a
circle, for which the Wigner functions are presented. These states are obtained
by applying a suitable displacement operator $D_{h}(\alpha) $ to the vacuum
state. The unity resolutions in terms of the projectors $| \alpha, h> < \alpha,
h^{-1}| ,| \alpha, h^{-1}> < \alpha, h| $ are presented together with a measure
allowing a resolution in terms of $| \alpha, h> < \alpha, h| $. $D_{h}(\alpha)
$ is also used for introducing the probability distribution funtion
$\rho_{A,h}(z) $ while the existence of a measure is exploited for extending
the P-representation to these states. The weight of the n-th Fock state of the
NCS relative to a trapped ion with Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta ,$ oscillates so
wildly as $n$ grows up to infinity that the normalized NCS fill the open circle
$\eta ^{-1}$ in the complex $\alpha $-plane. In addition this prevents the
existence of a measure including normalizable states only. This difficulty is
overcome by introducing a family of deformations which are rational functions
of n, each of them admitting a measure. By increasing the degree of these
rational approximations the deformation of a trapped ion can be approximated
with any degree of accuracy and the formalism of the P-representation can be
applied.
