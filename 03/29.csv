embedded in a protoplanetary disc whereby a giant protoplanet is caught up,
before having migrated all the way to the central star, by a lighter outer
giant protoplanet. This outer protoplanet may get captured into the 2:3
resonance with the more massive one, in which case the gaps that the two
planets open in the disc overlap. Two effects arise, namely a squared mass
weighted torque imbalance and an increased mass flow through the overlapping
gaps from the outer disc to the inner disc, which both play in favour of an
outwards migration. Indeed under the conditions presented here, which describe
the evolution of a pair of protoplanets respectively Jupiter and Saturn sized,
the migration is reversed, while the planets semi-major axis ratio is constant
and the eccentricities are confined to small values by the disc material. The
long-term behaviour of the system is briefly discussed, and could account for
the high eccentricities observed for the extrasolar planets with semi-major
axis a>0.2 AU.

metal-rich} open cluster NGC6791 has been a mystery. If these hot stars are in
their core helium burning phase, they are significantly bluer (hotter) than
predicted by canonical stellar evolution theory. No obvious explanation is
available yet. We consider the effects of mass loss during the evolution of
horizontal branch (HB) stars as their possible origin. We find that the
addition of mass loss causes HB stars to evolve to be hotter and fainter. Mass
loss has a more pronounced effect for less massive stars and thus naturally
widens the temperature (and color) distribution on the HB. If mass loss rates
are higher for more metal-rich stars, this phenomenon would be even more
pronounced in the metal-rich populations, such as NGC6791. We find that mass
loss on the HB may be a viable method of forming subdwarf B (sdB) stars both in
the field and in clusters, especially when the metallicity is high.

AB (z(A)=1.455; z(B)=1.451, and angular separation theta=9 arcsec). An unusual
broad-absorption-line (BAL) system is observed only in the B component: maximum
outflow velocity of ~5000 km/s; probably a mixture of broad and narrow
components. Observed ions are: HI, CII, CIII, NIII, NV, OVI, and possibly SIV
and SVI. We also discuss two outstanding intervening systems: (1) a complex CIV
system at z=0.72 of similar strength in A and B, with a velocity span of 1500
km/s; and (2) a possible strong MgII system at z=0.04 observed in B only.
  Assuming HS 1216+5032 is a binary QSO, the size of Ly-alpha forest clouds is
constrained using S~ 80 /h_50 kpc at redshifts between z=1.15 and 1.45. Four
Ly-alpha systems not associated with metal lines and producing lines with
W_0>0.17 AA are observed in both spectra, while five appear in only one
spectrum. This sample, although scarce due to the redshift path blocked out by
the BALs in B, allows us to place upper limits on the transverse cloud sizes.
Modelling the absorbers as non-evolving spheres, a maximum-likelihood analysis
yields a most probable cloud diameter D=256 /h_50 kpc and 2 sigma bounds of
172<D<896 /h_50 kpc. If the clouds are modelled as filamentary structures, the
same analysis yields lower transverse dimensions by a factor of two.
Independently of the maximum-likelihood approach, the equivalent width
differences provide evidence for coherent structures. The suggestion that the
size of Ly-alpha forest clouds increases with decreasing redshift is not
confirmed.

  Gutzwiller Approximation","20 pages, 11 eps figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  A new type of analytic estimation of the effect of strong correlation is
developed for the two-dimensional t-J model. It is based on the Gutzwiller
approximation which gives the renormalization of parameters, t and J, due to
the Gutzwiller's projection operator excluding the double occupancies. The
finite-range correlations are taken into account compared with the conventional
Gutzwiller approximation where only the on-site expectation values are
considered. It is shown that the essential point of the renormalization is its
nonlinear dependence on the expectation values of Cooper pairs and
antiferromagnetic moment. In particular the renormalization factor of J becomes
anisotropic in the presence of antiferromagnetic moment, i.e., that for the
z-component is enhanced compared with that for the xy-component. The physical
origin of this enhancement is identified as the surrounding antiferromagnetic
correlations of a bond. The self-consistency equations for the uniform
variational wave functions are derived and solved numerically. Our result gives
a reasonable estimate of antiferromagnetic order parameters near half filling,
in contrast to the conventional slave-boson mean-field theory and the original
Gutzwiller approximation. It is also found that, at half filling, the
renormalization of J represents some of the quantum fluctuations of the
Heisenberg spin system in a different manner from the spin-wave theory. For
finite doping, our results have some similarity to SO(5) symmetric theory.
Applications to the inhomogeneous systems such as the vortex state, around
nonmagnetic impurities, and stripe state are discussed.

received much attention because it would seem to be much easier to
experimentally create an acoustic horizon than to create an event horizon. We
wish to point out some potential difficulties (and opportunities) in actually
setting up an experiment that possesses an acoustic horizon. We show that in
zero-viscosity, stationary fluid flow with generic boundary conditions, the
creation of an acoustic horizon is accompanied by a formally infinite ``surface
gravity'', and a formally infinite Hawking flux. Only by applying a suitable
non-constant external body force, and for very specific boundary conditions on
the flow, can these quantities be kept finite. This problem is ameliorated in
more realistic models of the fluid. For instance, adding viscosity always makes
the Hawking flux finite, but greatly complicates the behaviour of the acoustic
radiation --- viscosity is tantamount to explicitly breaking ``acoustic Lorentz
invariance''. Thus, this issue represents both a difficulty and an opportunity
--- acoustic horizons may be somewhat more difficult to form than naively
envisaged, but if formed, they may be much easier to detect than one would at
first suppose.

free from anomalies, making it possible to incorporate the superfields for
right-handed neutrinos and an SU(2)-singlet Higgs boson. The vacuum expectation
value of this Higgs boson, which induces spontaneous breakdown of the U(1)
symmetry, yields large Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos, leading
to small masses for the ordinary neutrinos. The linear coupling of
SU(2)-doublet Higgs superfields, which is indispensable to the superpotential
of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, is replaced by a trilinear
coupling of the Higgs superfields, so that there is no mass parameter in the
superpotential. The energy dependencies of the model parameters are studied,
showing that gauge symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections.
Certain ranges of the parameter values compatible with phenomena at the

effective actions of N=2 supersymmetric theories with gauge group SU(2) are in
agreement with instanton computations carried out for winding numbers one and
two. This suggests that the instanton saddle point saturates the
non-perturbative contribution to the functional integral. A natural framework
in which corrections to this approximation are absent is given by the
topological field theory built out of the N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory. After
extending the standard construction of the Topological Yang-Mills theory to
encompass the case of a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the scalar
field, a BRST transformation is defined (as a supersymmetry plus a gauge
variation), which on the instanton moduli space is the exterior derivative. The
topological field theory approach makes the so-called ""constrained instanton""
configurations and the instanton measure arise in a natural way. As a
consequence, instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2 Super Yang-Mills can
be equivalently computed either using the constrained instanton method or
making reference to the topological twisted version of the theory. We
explicitly compute the instanton measure and the contribution to $u=<\Tr
\phi^2>$ for winding numbers one and two. We then show that each
non-perturbative contribution to the N=2 low-energy effective action can be
written as the integral of a total derivative of a function of the instanton
moduli. Only instanton configurations of zero conformal size contribute to this
result. Finally, the 8k-dimensional instanton moduli space is built using the
hyperkahler quotient procedure, which clarifies the geometrical meaning of our
approach.

  with Applications to Cancer","25 pages, 2 tables",,,,"nlin.AO q-bio",,"  A system-level genetic code is a hypothetical genetic code that exclusively
or preferentially codes systems of interacting coadapted parts. System-level
genetic codes differ from part-level genetic codes in which each discrete part
is coded independently. In general, a system-level genetic code requires coding
discrete interacting parts such as organs or proteins in an interdependent way.
Changing a single symbol or ""gene"" in a system-level genetic code affects two
or more parts in a coordinated way. System-level genetic codes provide a
plausible mechanism for evolution by leaps also known as systemic
macromutations or hopeful monsters without invoking an intelligent agent,
vitalistic forces, or new laws of physics. A system-level genetic code may
explain the rapid appearance of new forms of life in the fossil record such as
the Cambrian Explosion in which most invertebrate phyla appeared. A
system-level genetic code may explain the origin of complex integrative systems
of tightly coadapted proteins such as the blood coagulation cascade in which
the removal or structural modification of any single part breaks the system. It
is demonstrated that a simple system-level genetic code can, in principle, be
implemented using biochemical mechanisms similar or identical to the mechanisms
used by transposable elements, regulation of gene expression, and the adaptive
vertebrate immune system. It is further suggested that cancer in the body and
both normal and tumor cell lines cultured in vitro are caused by mutations of
the system-level genetic code. An explanation why multi-cellular organisms
retain the ability to revert to uni-cellularity and thus a tendency to develop
cancer is presented.
