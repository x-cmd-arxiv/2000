compared with observations and simulations of cosmological halos from dwarf

virialized halos are isothermal, which leads to a prediction of a unique
nonsingular isothermal sphere for the equilibrium structure, with a core radius
which is approximately 1/30 times the size and a core density which is
proportional to the mean background density at the epoch of collapse. These
predicted nonsingular isothermal spheres are in good agreement with the
observations of the internal structure of dark-matter-dominated halos from
dwarf galaxies to X-ray clusters.

Observatory in order to determine the size of their FIR emitting regions. Most
of these galaxies are luminous far-infrared sources, with L_FIR > 10^11 L_sun.
This data constitutes the highest spatial resolution ever achieved on luminous
galaxies in the far infrared. Our data includes direct measurements of the
spatial structure of the sources, in which we look for departures from point
source profiles. Additionally, comparison of our small beam 100 micron fluxes
with the large beam IRAS fluxes shows how much flux falls beyond our detectors
but within the IRAS beam. Several sources with point- like cores show evidence
for such a net flux deficit. We clearly resolved six of these galaxies at 100
microns and have some evidence for extension in seven others. Those galaxies
which we have resolved can have little of their 100 micron flux directly
emitted by a point-like active galactic nucleus (AGN). Dust heated to ~40 K by
recent bursts of non-nuclear star formation provides the best explanation for
their extreme FIR luminosity. In a few cases, heating of an extended region by
a compact central source is also a plausible option. Assuming the FIR emission
we see is from dust, we also use the sizes we derive to find the dust
temperatures and optical depths at 100 microns which we translate into an
effective visual extinction through the galaxy. Our work shows that studies of
the far infrared structure of luminous infrared galaxies is clearly within the
capabilities of new generation far infrared instrumentation, such as SOFIA and
SIRTF.

main-sequence phase. With standard assumptions for convective overshooting a
case B mass transfer starting with a 3.5 M_sun donor star is the most likely
evolutionary solution for Cygnus X-2. This makes the currently observed state
rather short-lived, of order 3 Myr, and requires a formation rate > 1e-7 - 1e-6

IMXBs with initially more massive donors (> 4 M_sun) encounter a delayed
dynamical instability; they are unlikely to survive this rapid mass transfer
phase. We determine limits for the age and initial parameters of Cygnus X-2 and
calculate possible dynamical orbits of the system in a realistic Galactic
potential, given its observed radial velocity. We find trajectories which are
consistent with a progenitor binary on a circular orbit in the Galactic plane
inside the solar circle that received a kick velocity < 200 km/s at the birth
of the neutron star. The simulations suggests that about 7% of IMXBs receiving
an arbitrary kick velocity from a standard kick velocity spectrum would end up
in an orbit similar to Cygnus X-2, while about 10% of them reach yet larger

absorptions which are consistent with an origin in quickly rotating (v sin i ~

highly veiled at near-infrared wavelengths, confirming previous findings of

more rapidly than classical T Tauri stars (Class II sources), supporting
findings from a recent high resolution spectroscopic study of other

consistent with the high rotation rates derived for two of the Class I

Chern-Simons state, which is a well-known exact wavefunctional within the
Ashtekar theory, can be transformed to the real triad representation by means
of a suitably generalized Fourier transformation, yielding a complex integral
representation for the corresponding state in the triad variables. It is found
that topologically inequivalent choices for the complex integration contour
give rise to linearly independent wavefunctionals in the triad representation,
which all arise from the one Chern-Simons state in the Ashtekar variables. For
a suitable choice of the normalization factor, these states turn out to be
gauge-invariant under arbitrary, even topologically non-trivial
gauge-transformations. Explicit analytical expressions for the wavefunctionals
in the triad representation can be obtained in several interesting asymptotic
parameter regimes, and the associated semiclassical 4-geometries are discussed.
In restriction to Bianchi-type homogeneous 3-metrics, we compare our results
with earlier discussions of homogeneous cosmological models. Moreover, we
define an inner product on the Hilbert space of quantum gravity, and choose a
natural gauge-condition fixing the time-gauge. With respect to this particular
inner product, the Chern-Simons state of quantum gravity turns out to be a
non-normalizable wavefunctional.

Elimination of the quark-gluon coupling at small gluon momenta is governed by
the cutoff dependent, dynamical gluon mass, which makes this elimination
possible and provides such an enhancement at $q\sim 0$. The cutoff, which
regulates small light-front $x$ divergences, sets up a scale for the dynamical

the quantum mechanical time-evolution of QSC's the corresponding stars are
compatible with the Hopf structures. However, in the case of statistical models
the resulting star structure is not a Hopf one but what we call a twisted star.
Real representations of a twisted star Hopf algebra do not close under the

(g(h) h_x)_x by means of a dissipated energy (a Liapunov function). Here h(x,t)
is nonnegative, and at h=0 the coefficient functions f>0 and g can either
degenerate to 0, or blow up to infinity, or tend to a nonzero constant.
  We first show all positive periodic steady states are 'energy unstable' fixed
points for the evolution (meaning the energy decreases under some zero--mean
perturbation) if g/f is convex or if the perturbations are allowed to have
period longer than that of the steady state.
  For power law coefficients (f(y) = y^n and g(y) = B y^m for some B > 0) we
analytically determine the relative energy levels of distinct steady states.
For example, with m-n in [1,2) and for suitable choices of the period and mean
value, we find three fundamentally different steady states. The first is a
constant steady state that is nonlinearly stable and is a local minimum of the
energy. The second is a positive periodic steady state that is linearly
unstable and has higher energy than the constant steady state; it is a saddle
point. The third is a periodic collection of 'droplet' (compactly supported)
steady states having lower energy than either the positive steady state or the
constant one. Since the energy must decrease along every orbit, these results
significantly constrain the dynamics of the evolution equation.
  Our results suggest that heteroclinic connections could exist between certain
of the steady states, for example from the periodic steady state to the droplet
one. In a companion article we perform numerical simulations to confirm their
existence.

periodic and constant steady states; to locate heteroclinic connecting orbits
between these steady states and the compactly supported 'droplet' steady
states; and to determine how these orbits change when the 'mobility' exponents
n and m are changed.
  For example, we change the mobility coefficients in such a way that the
steady states are unchanged and find evidence that heteroclinic orbits between
steady states are perturbed but not broken. We also find that when there appear
to be touch-down singularities, the exponent n affects whether they occur in
finite or infinite time. It also can affect whether there is one touch-down or

signal detection in sensory systems. In the case of hearing, we argue that
active amplification of faint sounds is provided by a dynamical system which is
maintained at the threshold of an oscillatory instability. This concept can
account for the exquisite sensitivity of the auditory system and its wide
dynamic range, as well as its capacity to respond selectively to different
frequencies. A specific model of sound detection by the hair cells of the inner
ear is discussed. We show that a collection of motor proteins within a hair
bundle can generate oscillations at a frequency which depends on the elastic
properties of the bundle. Simple variation of bundle geometry gives rise to
hair cells with characteristic frequencies which span the range of audibility.
Tension-gated transduction channels, which primarily serve to detect the motion
of a hair bundle, also tune each cell by admitting ions which regulate the
motor protein activity. By controlling the bundle's propensity to oscillate,
this feedback automatically maintains the system in the operating regime where
it is most sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli. The model explains how hair cells
can detect sounds which carry less energy than the background noise.

generated via a self-organization of elastic filaments and molecular motors.
Oscillatory motion and the propagation of bending waves can occur for an
initially non-moving state via an instability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to
this instability, the behavior of the system is shown to be independent of
microscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating mechanism. The
oscillation frequency however does depend on properties of the molecular
motors. We calculate the oscillation frequency at the bifurcation point and
show that a large frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length
