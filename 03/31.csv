  axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes and disks","18 pages, 32 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present an algorithm for two-dimensional radiative transfer in
axisymmetric, circumstellar media. The formal integration of the transfer
equation is performed by a generalization of the short characteristics (SC)
method to spherical coordinates. Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) and Ng's
algorithm are used to converge towards a solution. By taking a logarithmically
spaced radial coordinate grid, the method has the natural capability of
treating problems that span several decades in radius, in the most extreme case
from the stellar radius up to parsec scale. Flux conservation is guaranteed in
spherical coordinates by a particular choice of discrete photon directions and
a special treatment of nearly-radially outward propagating radiation. The
algorithm works well from zero up to very high optical depth, and can be used
for a wide variety of transfer problems, including non-LTE line formation, dust
continuum transfer and high temperature processes such as compton scattering.
In this paper we focus on multiple scattering off dust grains and on non-LTE
transfer in molecular and atomic lines. Line transfer is treated according to
an ALI scheme for multi-level atoms/molecules, and includes both random and
systematic velocity fields. The algorithms are implemented in a multi-purpose
user-friendly radiative transfer program named RADICAL. We present two example
computations: one of dust scattering in the Egg Nebula, and one of non-LTE line
formation in rotational transitions of HCO$^{+}$ in a flattened protostellar
collapsing cloud.

virtue of their isotropic steep-spectrum extended emission. We use the new 7C
Redshift Survey along with the brighter 3CRR and 6C samples to investigate the
fraction of objects with observed broad emission lines - the `quasar fraction'
- as a function of redshift and of radio and narrow emission line luminosity.
We find that the quasar fraction is more strongly dependent upon luminosity
(both narrow line and radio) than it is on redshift. Above a narrow [OII]
emission line luminosity of log L_[OII] > 35 W (or radio luminosity log L_151 >
26.5 W/Hz/sr), the quasar fraction is virtually independent of redshift and
luminosity; this is consistent with a simple unified scheme with an obscuring
torus with a half-opening angle theta_trans approx 53 degrees. For objects with
less luminous narrow lines, the quasar fraction is lower. We show that this is
not due to the difficulty of detecting lower-luminosity broad emission lines in
a less luminous, but otherwise similar, quasar population. We discuss evidence
which supports at least two probable physical causes for the drop in quasar
fraction at low luminosity: (i) a gradual decrease in theta_trans and/or a
gradual increase in the fraction of lightly-reddened (0 < A(V) < 5)
lines-of-sight with decreasing quasar luminosity; and (ii) the emergence of a
distinct second population of low luminosity radio sources which, like M87,
lack a well-fed quasar nucleus and may well lack a thick obscuring torus.

burst sources (Klu\'zniak & Ruderman 1998) is considered in some detail. A
steadily accreting $10^6$ Gauss magnetic white dwarf should ultimately collapse
to a strongly differentially rotating, millisecond-rotation-period neutron star
for a wide range of steady accretion rates and initial masses if the accreting
white dwarf has an evolved O-Ne-Mg composition. A similar neutron star could
also result from an initial C-O white dwarf but only for more constrained
accretion rates. Because the collapsing white dwarf begins as a $\gamma=4/3$
polytrope, the final neutron star's spin-rate increases strongly with
cylindrical radius. A stable wind-up of the neutron star's poloidal magnetic
field then produces buoyant magnetic toroids which grow, break loose, rise, and
partly penetrate the neutron star surface to form a transient, $B\approx
10^{17}$ G millisecond spin-period pulsar with a powerful pulsar wind (Usov
1992). This pulsar wind emission is then rapidly suppressed by the surface
shear motion from the strong stellar differential rotation. This wind-up and
transient pulsar formation can occur at other times on different cylinders
and/or repeat on the same one, with (re-)wind up and surface penetration time
scales hugely longer han the neutron star's millisecond spin period. In this
way, differential rotation both opens and closes the doors which allow neutron
star spin-energy to be emitted in powerful bursts of pulsar wind. Predictions
of this model compare favorably to needed central engine properties of
gamma-ray burst sources (total energy, duration, sub-burst fluctuations and
time scales, variability among burst events, and baryon loading).

derive constraints on their intrinsic shapes and orientations. We develop an
iterative Bayesian algorithm to combine these results to estimate the parent
shape distribution from which the sample was drawn, under the assumption that
this parent distribution has no preferred orientation. In the process we obtain
improved estimates for the shapes of individual objects. The parent shape
distribution shows a tendency toward bimodality, with peaks at the oblate and
prolate limits. Under minimal assumptions about the galaxies' internal
dynamics, 35% of the objects would be strongly triaxial (0.2 < T < 0.8).
However, the parent distribution is sensitive to the assumed orbit populations
in the galaxies. Dynamical configurations in which all galaxies rotate purely
about either their long or short axes can be ruled out because they would
require the sample to have a strong orientation bias. Configurations in which
the mean motion about the short or long axis is either ``disklike''---dropping
off away from the symmetry planes---or ``spheroidlike''---remaining roughly
constant at a given radius---are equally viable. Spheroidlike rotation in the
long-axis or short-axis tube orbits significantly lowers the abundance of
prolate or oblate galaxies, respectively. If rotation in ellipticals is
generally disklike, then triaxiality is rare; if spheroidlike, triaxiality is
common.

light curve (1-10 days after the optical maximum) is well reproduced by a
thermonuclear runaway model on a very massive WD close to the Chandrasekhar
limit (1.37 +- 0.01 M_sun). The ensuing plateau phase (10-30 days) is also
reproduced by the combination of a slightly irradiated MS and a fully
irradiated flaring-up disk with a radius ~1.4 times the Roche lobe size. The
best fit parameters are the WD mass 1.37 M_sun, the companion mass 1.5 M_sun
(0.8-2.0 M_sun is acceptable), the inclination angle of the orbit i~65-68
degree, and the flaring-up rim ~0.30 times the disk radius. The envelope mass
at the optical peak is estimated to be ~6 x 10^{-6} M_sun, which indicates an
average mass accretion rate of 1.5 x 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1} during the quiescent
phase between the 1949 and 1987 outbursts. In the quiescent phase, the observed
light curve can be reproduced with a disk size of 0.7 times the Roche lobe size

About 0.5 mag sinusoidal variation of the light curve requires the mass
accretion rate higher than ~1.0 x 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1}, which is consistent

property of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) discovered very recently through
single-molecule manipulation techniques. A general elastic model for
double-stranded biopolymers is proposed and a new structural parameter called
the folding angle $\phi$ is introduced to characterize their deformations. The
mechanical property of long dsDNA molecules is then studied based on this
model, where the base-stacking interactions between DNA adjacent nucleotide
basepairs, the steric effects of basepairs, and the electrostatic interactions
along DNA backbones are taken into account. Quantitative results are obtained
by using path integral method, and excellent agreement between theory and the
observations reported by five major experimental groups are attained. The
strong intensity of the base-stacking interactions ensures the structural
stability of DNA, while the short-ranged nature of such interactions makes
externally-stimulated large structural fluctuations possible. The entropic
elasticity, highly extensibility, and supercoiling property of DNA are all
closely related to this account. The present work also suggests the possibility
that negative torque can induce structural transitions in highly extended DNA
from right-handed B-form to left-handed configurations similar with Z-form
configuration. Some formulae concerned with the application of path integral
method to polymeric systems are listed in the Appendix.

both word-word and class-class transitions explicitly. A common n-gram based

characterized by relatively sparse training data and issues related to

Investigating such systems out of equilibrium has recently been shown to
display several interesting features. We extend here this type of
investigations to finite temperature systems. Essentially the novel features
observed at T=0 carry over to finite temperature. This is not unexpected, as
the main mechanisms that determine the late-time behavior remain the same. We
extend two empirical - presumably exact - relations for the late-time behavior
to finite temperature and use them to define the boundaries between the region
of different asymptotic regimes. This results in a phase diagram with the
temperature and the initial value of the classical field as parameters, the
phases being characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking resp. symmetry
restoration. The time evolution is computed numerically and agrees very well

elastic pion-pion scattering to obtain the off-shell width of the rho_0 meson.
We adopt a definition of the off-shell width of spin-1 meson resonances that
satisfies the requirements of analyticity, unitarity, chiral symmetry and
asymptotic behaviour ruled by QCD. To fulfil these constraints the resummation
procedure cannot consist only of self-energy diagrams. Our width definition is
shown to be independent of the formulation used to describe the spin-1 meson
resonances.

$B_d\to\pi^0K$ may provide non-trivial bounds on the CKM angle $\gamma$. In
this paper, we reconsider this approach in the light of recent CLEO data, which
look very interesting. In particular, the results for the corresponding
CP-averaged branching ratios are in favour of strong constraints on $\gamma$,
where the second quadrant is preferred. Such a situation would be in conflict
with the standard analysis of the unitarity triangle. Moreover, constraints on
a CP-conserving strong phase $\delta_n$ are in favour of a negative value of
$\cos\delta_n$, which would be in conflict with the factorization expectation.
In addition, there seems to be an interesting discrepancy with the bounds that
are implied by the charged $B\to\pi K$ system: whereas these decays favour a
range for $\gamma$ that is similar to that of the neutral modes, they point
towards a positive value of $\cos\delta_c$, which would be in conflict with the
expectation of equal signs for $\cos\delta_n$ and $\cos\delta_c$. If future
data should confirm this ``puzzle'', it may be an indication for new-physics
contributions to the electroweak penguin sector, or a manifestation of large

summation in the case of divergence by detecting and utilizing regularities of
the elements of the sequence to be transformed. For sufficiently large indices,
certain asymptotic regularities normally do exist, but the leading elements of
a sequence may behave quite irregularly. The Gaussian hypergeometric series 2F1
(a, b; c; z) is well suited to illuminate problems of that kind. Sequence
transformations perform quite well for most parameters and arguments. If,
however, the third parameter $c$ of a nonterminating hypergeometric series 2F1
is a negative real number, the terms initially grow in magnitude like the terms
of a mildly divergent series. The use of the leading terms of such a series as
input data leads to unreliable and even completely nonsensical results. In
contrast, sequence transformations produce good results if the leading
irregular terms are excluded from the transformation process. Similar problems
occur also in perturbation expansions. For example, summation results for the
infinite coupling limit k_3 of the sextic anharmonic oscillator can be improved
considerably by excluding the leading terms from the transformation process.
Finally, numerous new recurrence formulas for the 2F1 (a, b; c; z) are derived.

transcription. Such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting
networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their
own expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered
control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such
networks lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a
model describing the regulation of gene expression, and elucidate the effects
of noise on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from
bacteriophage $\lambda$, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model
describing the temporal evolution of the concentration of $\lambda$ repressor
protein. Bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises
naturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of
the first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and
multiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the
additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the
construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on''
and ``off'' using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that
small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in
the production of protein, and describe how these fluctuations can be used to
amplify protein production significantly. These novel results suggest that an
external noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene
expression. Such a development could have important implications for gene
therapy.
