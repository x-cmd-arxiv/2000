The region outside the central starburst has a derived radio supernova rate of

younger age is formally excluded because it provides a poor fit to the number

uncertain selection function, ages as low as 9 Gyr are plausible even though

the motivation for conducting cosmological submillimetre and millimetre

electromagnetism in spacetime, gravito-electromagnetic potentials and fields
are defined to emulate electromagnetic gauge transformations under
substitutions belonging to the gauge symmetry group of perturbative
gravitation. These definitions have the advantage that on a flat background,
with the aid of a covariantly constant timelike vector field, a subset of the
linearised gravitational field equations can be written in a form that is fully
analogous to Maxwell's equations (without awkward factors of 4 and extraneous
tensor fields). It is shown how the remaining equations in the perturbed
gravitational system restrict the time dependence of solutions to these
equations and thereby prohibit the existence of propagating vector fields. The
induced gravito-electromagnetic Lorentz force on a test particle is evaluated
in terms of these fields together with the torque on a small gyroscope. It is
concluded that the analogy of perturbative gravity to Maxwell's description of

""bar"" mode that transforms the star from a disk shape to an elongated bar. The
fate of such a bar-shaped star is uncertain. Some previous numerical studies
indicate that the bar is short lived, lasting for only a few bar-rotation
periods, while other studies suggest that the bar is relatively long lived.
This paper contains the results of a numerical simulation of a rapidly rotating
gamma=5/3 fluid star. The simulation shows that the bar shape is long lived:
once the bar is established, the star retains this shape for more than 10
bar-rotation periods, through the end of the simulation. The results are
consistent with the conjecture that a star will retain its bar shape
indefinitely on a dynamical time scale, as long as its rotation rate exceeds
the threshold for secular bar instability. The results are described in terms
of a low density neutron star, but can be scaled to represent, for example, a
burned-out stellar core that is prevented from complete collapse by centrifugal
forces. Estimates for the gravitational-wave signal indicate that a dynamically
unstable neutron star in our galaxy can be detected easily by the first
generation of ground based gravitational-wave detectors. The signal for an
unstable neutron star in the Virgo cluster might be seen by the planned
advanced detectors. The Newtonian/quadrupole approximation is used throughout
this work.

gluon plasma has been found to be enhanced due to collinear singularities. This
enhancement pattern is very dependent on rather strict collinearity conditions
between the photon and the quark momenta. It was estimated by neglecting the
collisional width of quasi-particles. In this paper, we study the modifications
of this collinear enhancement when we take into account the possibility for the
quarks to have a finite mean free path. Assuming a mean free path of order
$(g^2T\ln(1/g))^{-1}$, we find that only low invariant mass photons are
affected. The region where collision effects are important can be interpreted
as the region where the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect plays a role in
thermal photon production by bremsstrahlung. It is found that this effect
modifies the spectrum of very energetic photons as well. Based on these results
and on a previous work on infrared singularities, we end this paper by a
reasonable physical picture for photon production by a quark gluon plasma, that
should be useful to set directions for future technical developments.

of such criteria, we present the relations between the current matrix elements

between these two frames. Thus, the pseudoscalar and vector form factors
obtained by the diagonal convolution formalism in both frames must indeed be

light-front helicities are changed and the plus component of the current is
mixed with other components under the change of reference frame. In such a
case, the relationship between the frames should be carefully analyzed before

describes spherical branes in an inflating higher-dimensional universe.
Instantons obtained by a Euclidean continuation of such solutions describe
quantum nucleation of the entire inflating brane-world, or of a spherical brane
in an inflating higher-dimensional universe. For Lambda < 0, one class of
solutions exhibits an exponential warp factor. It is similar to spacetimes
previously discussed by Randall and Sundrum for n = 1 and by Gregory for n = 2.
