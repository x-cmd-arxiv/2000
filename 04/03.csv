the Fe/H abundance as the sole unknown. We apply this technique to a compact

Uncertainties in the CDS radiometric calibration, the VLA intensity

these, more than half are clustered on a Great Circle on the sky which
intersects the center of Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) and is parallel to its
proper motion vector, while many of the remainder are outlying Magellanic Cloud
C-stars. A pole-count analysis of the carbon star distribution clearly
indicates that the Great Circle stream we have isolated is statistically
significant, being a 5-6 sigma over-density. These two arguments strongly
support our conclusion that a large fraction of the Halo carbon stars
originated in Sgr. The stream orbits the Galaxy between the present location of
Sgr, 16 kpc from the Galactic center, and the most distant stream carbon star,
at ~60 kpc. It follows neither a polar nor a Galactic plane orbit, so that a
large range in both Galactic R and z distances are probed. That the stream is
observed as a Great Circle indicates that the Galaxy does not exert a
significant torque upon the stream, so the Galactic potential must be nearly
spherical in the regions probed by the stream. We present N-body experiments
simulating this disruption process as a function of the distribution of mass in
the Galactic halo. A likelihood analysis shows that, in the Galactocentric
distance range 16 kpc < R < 60 kpc, the dark halo is most likely almost
spherical. We rule out, at high confidence levels, the possibility that the
Halo is significantly oblate, with isodensity contours of aspect q_m < 0.7.
This result is quite unexpected and contests currently popular galaxy formation

source of high-energy radiation in low-mass X-ray binaries which contain weakly

  We find that the main portion of the boundary layer gas is hot (> ~10^8 K),
low in density, radially and vertically extended, and optically thick to
scattering but optically thin to absorption. It will produce large X-ray
luminosity by Comptonization. Energy is transported inward by viscosity,
concentrating the energy dissipation in the dense, optically thick zone close
to the stellar surface. We explore the dependence of the boundary layer
structure on the mass accretion rate, the rotation rate of the star, the alpha
viscosity parameter and the viscosity prescription.
  Radiation pressure is the dominant source of pressure in the boundary layer;
the flux is close to the Eddington limiting flux even for luminosities well
below (~0.01 times) L(Edd). At luminosities near L(Edd), the boundary layer
expands radially, and has a radial extent larger than one stellar radius.
  Based on the temperatures and optical depths which characterize the boundary
layer, we expect that Comptonization will produce a power-law spectrum at low
source luminosities. At high luminosities, a Planckian spectrum will be
produced in the dense region where most of the energy is released, and modified
by Comptonization as the radiation propagates outward.

evolutionary game theory, expound that speculative and crowd behavior of

the two views refer to two classes of companies connected through a ``phase
transition''. Our theory is based on 1) the identification of the fundamental
parity symmetry of prices ($p \to -p$), which results from the relative
direction of payment flux compared to commodity flux and 2) the observation
that a company's risk-adjusted growth rate discounted by the market interest
rate behaves as a control parameter for the observable price. We find a
critical value of this control parameter at which a spontaneous
symmetry-breaking of prices occurs, leading to a spontaneous valuation in
absence of earnings, similarly to the emergence of a spontaneous magnetization
in Ising models in absence of a magnetic field. The low growth rate phase is
described by the firm foundation theory while the large growth rate phase is
the regime of speculation and crowd behavior. In practice, while large
``finite-time horizon'' effects round off the predicted singularities, our
symmetry-breaking speculation theory accounts for the apparent over-pricing and
the high volatility of fast growing companies on the stock markets.

lose their long-range orientational order by the action of quenched random

rubber elasticity. We present a detailed picture of mechanical quasi-Goldstone
modes, which accounts for an almost completely soft polydomain-monodomain (P-M)
transition under strain as well as a ``four-leaf clover'' pattern in
depolarized light scattering intensity. Dynamical relaxation of the domain
structure is studied using a simple model. The peak wavenumber of the structure
factor obeys a power-law-type slow kinetics and goes to zero in true mechanical
equilibrium. The effect of quenched disorder on director fluctuation in the
monodomain state is analyzed. The random frozen contribution to the fluctuation
amplitude dominates the thermal one, at long wavelengths and near the P-M
transition threshold. We also study networks obtained by crosslinking
polydomain nematic polymer melts. The memory of initial director configuration
acts as correlated and strong quenched disorder, which renders the P-M
transition non-soft. The spatial distribution of the elastic free energy is
strongly dehomogenized by external strain, in contrast to the case of

(GL) theory. The available results for the Gaussian fluctuations are
systematized and a number of novel formulae for the fluctuation magnetization,
nonlinear magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and high-frequency
conductivity in layered superconductors are derived. We propose several new
prescriptions: how to determine the life-time constant of fluctuation Cooper
pairs tau_0, the in-plane coherence length xi_ab(0), the energy cutoff
parameter e_cut=c hbar^2 / 2m_ab xi^2_ab(0), and the Ginzburg number e_Gi. It
is demonstrated, for example, how the spectroscopy of the life-time can be used
to verify the existence of depairing mechanisms in layered cuprates. The
ultraviolet regularization of the GL free energy is carried out by means of the
well-known from the field theory zeta-function method. We further show that the
archetype of the latter method has its origin in the century of enlightenment
and the novel result is that the fluctuation part of the thermodynamic
variables of the layered superconductors can be expressed in terms of the Euler
Gamma-function and its derivatives. Universal scaling curves for the magnetic
field dependence of the paraconductivity sigma_ab(T_c,B), fluctuation
magnetization M(T_c,B) and the heat capacity C(T_c,B) are found for the
quasi-2D superconductors at T_c and further related to the form-factor of the

spaces in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The first class of
examples appears in the construction of dual Type I' string descriptions to
five dimensional supersymmetric fixed points with E_{N_f+1} global symmetry.
The background is obtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 brane
system in massive Type IIA supergravity. The second class of examples appears
when considering the N=2 superconformal theories defined on a 3+1 dimensional
hyperplane intersection of two sets of M5 branes. We use the dual string
formulations to deduce properties of these field theories.

different ranks. We study the scattering of gravitons in the corresponding
supergravity backgrounds. We show that the nonzero $B$ field does not modify
the form of the scattering potential. The graviton scattering equation has two
solutions one normalizable and one non-normalizable. The normalizable solution
does not lead to an absorption, however the non-normalizable one does. We
analyse the absorption of gravitons by the branes and show that it is nonzero
in the decoupling limit. This result suggests that even in the presence of a
$B$ field the D6 branes worldvolume theory does not decouple from the bulk
gravity. For comparison we analyse the form of the scattering potential and
absorption for Dp branes with $p <5$ and for NS5 branes.

into new 2-knots by local operations in B^4. (We do not assume the new knots is

  Let L_1 and L_2 be 2-links. Then the following hold. (1) If L_1 is
ribbon-move equivalent to L_2, then we have \mu(L_1)=\mu(L_2).
  (2) Suppose that L_1 is ribbon-move equivalent to L_2. Let W_i be arbitrary
Seifert hypersurfaces for L_i. Then the torsion part of H_1(W_1)+H_1(W_2) is
congruent to G+G for a finite abelian group G.
  (3) Not all 2-knots are ribbon-move equivalent to the trivial 2-knot.
  (4) The inverse of (1) is not true.
  (5) The inverse of (2) is not true.

is ribbon-move equivalent to a boundary link. (ii) \mu(L)= \mu(L_1) + \mu(L_2).
  We would point out the following facts by analogy of the discussions of
finite type invariants of 1-knots although they are very easy observations. By
the above result (1), we have: the \mu-invariant of 2-links is an order zero
finite type invariant associated with ribbon-moves and there is a 2-knot whose
\mu-invariant is not zero. The mod 2 alinking number of (S^2, T^2)-links is an

an (S^2, T^2)-link whose mod 2 alinking number is not zero.

topological transformation groups, existence of fixed points, and Ramsey-type
theorems for metric spaces. We prove that whenever the group $\Iso(\U)$ of
isometries of Urysohn's universal complete separable metric space $\mathbb U$,
equipped with the compact-open topology, acts upon an arbitrary compact space,
it has a fixed point. The same is true if $\U$ is replaced with any generalized
Urysohn metric space $U$ that is sufficiently homogeneous. Modulo a recent
theorem by Uspenskij that every topological group embeds into a topological
group of the form $\Iso(U)$, our result implies that every topological group
embeds into an extremely amenable group (one admitting an invariant
multiplicative mean on bounded right uniformly continuous functions). By way of
the proof, we show that every topological group is approximated by finite
groups in a certain weak sense. Our technique also results in a new proof of
the extreme amenability (fixed point on compacta property) for infinite
orthogonal groups. Going in the opposite direction, we deduce some Ramsey-type
theorems for metric subspaces of Hilbert spaces and for spherical metric spaces
from existing results on extreme amenability of infinite unitary groups and
groups of isometries of Hilbert spaces.

discretizations for a large class of algebraic completely integrable systems.
To be more precise, we construct families of Backlund transformations, which
are naturally parametrized by the points on the spectral curve(s) of the
system. The key idea is that a point on the curve determines, through the
Abel-Jacobi map, a vector on its Jacobian which determines a translation on the
corresponding level set of the integrals (the generic level set of an algebraic
completely integrable systems has a group structure). Globalizing this
construction we find (possibly multi-valued, as is very common for Backlund
transformations) maps which preserve the integrals of the system, they map
solutions to solutions and they are symplectic maps (or, more generally,
Poisson maps). We show that these have the spectrality property, a property of
Backlund transformations that was recently introduced. Moreover, we recover
Backlund transformations and discretizations which have up to now been
constructed by ad-hoc methods, and we find Backlund transformations and
discretizations for other integrable systems. We also introduce another
approach, using pairs of normalizations of eigenvectors of Lax operators and we
explain how our two methods are related through the method of separation of
variables.
