NGC 1700. Here we present new B, V and I band imaging using the Keck telescope
and reanalyse existing V and I band images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
After subtracting a model of the galaxy from the Keck images NGC 1700 reveals
two symmetric tidal tail-like structures. If this interpretation is correct, it
suggests a past merger event involving two spiral galaxies. These tails are
largely responsible for the `boxiness' of the galaxy isophotes observed at a
radius of about 13 kpc. We also show that the B-I colour distribution of the
globular cluster system is bimodal. The mean colour of the blue population is
consistent with those of old Galactic globular clusters. Relative to this old,
metal poor population, we find that the red population is younger and more
metal rich. This young population has a similar age and metallicity as that
inferred for the central stars, suggesting that they are both associated with
an episode of star formation triggered by the merger that may have formed the
galaxy. Although possessing large errors, we find that the majority of the age
estimates of NGC 1700 are reasonably consistent and we adopt a `best estimate'
for the age of 3.0 +/-1.0 Gyr. This relatively young age places NGC 1700 within
the age range where there is a notable lack of obvious candidates for
protoellipticals. The total globular cluster specific frequency is rather low
for a typical elliptical, even after taking into account fading of the galaxy
over the next 10 Gyr. We speculate that NGC 1700 will eventually form a
relatively `globular cluster poor' elliptical galaxy.

some applications of this data set for studying the evolution of giant
galaxies, on and off the Hubble Sequence. Large, relatively ordinary spiral
galaxies are found out to at least z=~1.25. Morphological irregularities seen
in many distant HDF galaxies tend to persist from ultraviolet through optical
rest frame wavelengths, suggesting that these are genuinely peculiar,
structurally disturbed systems. Red giant ellipticals are found out to
(photometric) redshifts z=~1.8, implying that some such galaxies probably
formed the bulk of their stars at z_f>~4. However, there are also bluer early
type galaxies at z>0.5, which may have experienced extended star formation
histories. Finally, there appears to be a substantial deficit of high
luminosity galaxies of all types at 1.4<~z<2 compared to lower redshifts.
However, this result must be considered with caution given the small volume of
the HDF, its susceptibility to line-of-sight clustering variations, and the
heavy reliance on photometric redshifts at z>~1.4.

optical rest frame (4000-5500A) for hundreds of ordinary galaxies at 2<z<3, and
which offers the means to search for still more distant objects at z>>5. Lyman
break galaxies at 2<z<3 are compact and often irregular in the NICMOS images;
ordinary Hubble sequence spirals and ellipticals seem to be largely absent at
these redshifts, and apparently reached maturity at 1<z<2. The Lyman break
galaxies have UV-optical spectral energy distributions like those of local
starburst galaxies. Population synthesis models suggest typical ages ~few x
10^8 years and moderate UV extinction (~1.2 mag at 1700A), but the constraints
are fairly weak and there may be considerable variety. Considering a near-IR
selected galaxy sample, there is little evidence for a significant number of
galaxies at z~3 that have been missed by UV-based Lyman break selection. Using
the well-characterized z~3 galaxy population as a point of reference, I
consider Lyman break galaxy candidates at 4.5<z<9, as well as one remarkable
object which might (or might not) be at z>12. The space density of UV-bright

surface brightness selection effects may play an important role.

(IMF) variable in time on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In order to do
that we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes
for the formation of the Galaxy. We study the effects on such a model of
different IMFs. First, we use a theoretical one based on the statistical
description of the density field arising from random motions in the gas. This
IMF is a function of time as it depends on physical conditions of the site of
star formation. We also investigate the behaviour of the model predictions
using other variable IMFs, parameterized as a function of metallicity. Our
results show that the theoretical IMF when applied to our model depends on time
but such time variation is important only in the early phases of the Galactic
evolution, when the IMF is biased towards massive stars. We also show that the
use of an IMF which is a stronger function of time does not lead to a good
agreement with the observational constraints suggesting that if the IMF varied
this variation should have been small. Our main conclusion is that the G-dwarf
metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large timescale and
a constant IMF, since it is possible to find variable IMFs of the kind studied
here, reproducing the G-dwarf metallicity but this worsens the agreement with
other observational constraints.

into emerging Omega-loops. The flux tubes rise buoyantly through an
adiabatically stratified plasma that represents the solar convection zone. The
MHD equations are solved in the anelastic approximation, and the results are
compared with studies of flux tube fragmentation in two dimensions. We find
that if the initial amount of field line twist is below a critical value, the
degree of fragmentation at the apex of a rising Omega-loop depends on its
three-dimensional geometry: the greater the apex curvature of a given
Omega-loop, the lesser the degree of fragmentation of the loop as it approaches
the photosphere. Thus, the amount of initial twist necessary for the loop to
retain its cohesion can be reduced substantially from the two-dimensional
limit. The simulations also suggest that as a fragmented flux tube emerges
through a relatively quiet portion of the solar disk, extended crescent-shaped
magnetic features of opposite polarity should form and steadily recede from one
another. These features eventually coalesce after the fragmented portion of the

determination of accurate abundances in low-metallicity (and may be also in

measurement of temperature-sensitive line ratios.
  In parallel a new R23 calibration has been derived on the base of recent data
and compared to previous calibrations. For oxygen-rich HII regions the present

internally frictionless neutron star spinning down electromagnetically in
vacuo. It is shown that the star precesses, but not freely: its regular
precession relative to the principal axes of inertia couples to the component
of the radiation torque associated with the near-zone radiation fields and is
modified into an anharmonic wobble. The wobble period \tau_1 typically
satisfies \tau_1 < 10^{-2}\tau_0, where \tau_0 is the braking time-scale; the
wobble amplitude evolves towards a constant non-zero value, oscillates, or
decreases to zero, depending on the degree of oblateness or prolateness of the
star and its initial spin state; and the (negative) angular frequency
derivative d{\omega}/dt oscillates as well, exhibiting quasi-periodic spikes
for triaxial stars of a particular figure. In light of these properties, a
young, Crab-like pulsar ought to display fractional changes of order unity in
the space of a few years in its pulse profile, magnetic inclination angle, and
d{\omega}/dt. Such changes are not observed, implying that the wobble is damped
rapidly by internal friction, if its amplitude is initially large upon
crystallization of the stellar crust. If the friction is localized in the inner
and outer crusts, the thermal luminosity of the neutron star increases by a
minimum amount \Delta L = 3*10^{31} (\epsilon / 10^{-12}) (\omega / 10^3 rad
s^{-1})^2 (\tau_d / 1 yr)^{-1} erg s^{-1}, where epsilon is the ellipticity and
\tau_d is the damping time-scale, with the actual value of \Delta L determined
in part by the thermal conduction time \tau_cond. The increased luminosity is
potentially detectable as thermal X-rays lasting for a time max(tau_d,tau_cond)
following crystallization of the crust.

cosmologically. This population makes itself apparent by microlensing high
redshift quasars and introducing pronounced variability into their observed
light curves. While several arguments dismissing this hypothesis have been
presented, a conclusive observational test is, alas, sadly lacking. In this
paper we investigate the effect of a cosmologically distributed population of
microlensing masses on galaxies at low to intermediate redshift. The
magnification of bright stars in these galaxies leads to small, but observable,
fluctuations in their surface brightness. The variability time scale for
Jupiter-mass lensing objects is of the order of a few months and this
population may be detected through a future space-based monitoring campaign of
a field containing $z \sim 0.5$ galaxies. The monitoring of galactic surface

of size i<=2 the nucleation is governed by fluctuations, during which by chance
i+1 atoms are present on the island. For large critical nuclei i>=3 by
contrast, the nucleation process can be described in a mean-field type manner,
which for large E_S corresponds to the approach developed by Tersoff et al.

island size at the onset of nucleation shows a power law in dependence on the
adatom diffusion rates, the incoming atom flux, and the step edge crossing
probability exp(-E_S/k_B T). For the case where the dissociation rates of
metastable clusters enter the problem as additional parameters, we set up a
semi-analytical approach based on novel rate equations, which can easily be
solved numerically. The results obtained from the theory are in good agreement

with doping is considered. It is shown that the transition of HTS from
insulator to metal passes through the particular dopant concentration range
where the local transfer of singlet electron pairs from oxygen ions to pairs of
neighboring cations (-U centers) are allowed while the single-electron
transitions are still forbidden. We believe it is this concentration range that
corresponds to the region of high-Tc superconductivity and the interelectron
attraction results from the interaction of electron pairs with -U centers.
Additional hole carriers are generated as the result of singlet electron pair
transitions from oxygen ions to -U-centers. The orbitals of the arising singlet
hole pairs are localized in the nearest vicinity of -U center. In such a system
the hole conductivity starts up at the dopant concentration exceeding the
classical 2D-percolation threshold for singlet hole pair orbitals. In the
framework of the proposed model the phase diagram Ln-214 HTS compounds is
constructed. The remarkable accord between calculated and experimental phase
diagrams may be considered as the confirmation of the supposed model. The main
features of hole carriers in HTS normal state are found to be the nondegenerate
distribution and the dominant contribution of electron-electron scattering to
the hole carrier relaxation processes. Various experimentally observed
anomalies of HTS properties are shown to be the consequences of the
above-mentioned features. The conclusion is made that HTS compounds are the
special class of solids where the unusual mechanism of superconductivity
different from BCS is realized.

Randall-Sundrum scenario, in which the observable matter is localized on a
matter brane separate from the Planck brane. As suggested via the holographic
interpretation of this scenario, we argue that the local dynamics of the Planck
brane - which determines the large scale 4-d geometry - is protected by the
high energy supersymmetry of the dual 4-d theory. With this assumption, we show
that the total vacuum energy naturally cancels in the effective 4-d Einstein
equation. This cancellation is robust against changes in the low energy
dynamics on the matter brane, which gets stabilized via the holographic RG
without any additional fine-tuning.

gravitational fluctuations, inhomogeneities which are believed to be more
important in inflationary cosmology. The back-reaction of fluctuations can be
described by an effective energy-momentum tensor. The issue of coordinate
invariance makes the analysis more complicated for scalar fluctuations than for
gravitational waves. We show that the back-reaction of fluctuations can be
described in a diffeomorphism-invariant way. In an inflationary cosmology, the
back-reaction is dominated by infrared modes. We show that these modes give a
contribution to the effective energy-momentum tensor of the form of a negative
cosmological constant whose absolute value grows in time. We speculate that
this may lead to a self-regulating dynamical relaxation mechanism for the
cosmological constant. This scenario would naturally lead to a finite remnant
cosmological constant with a magnitude corresponding to $\Omega_{\Lambda} \sim

supported by the chaotic region mainly living in the vicinity of the hierarchy
of regular islands. We show that the fraction of these hierarchical states
scales as $\hbar^{-\alpha}$ and relate the exponent $\alpha=1-1/\gamma$ to the
decay of the classical staying probability $P(t)\sim t^{-\gamma}$. This is
numerically confirmed for the kicked rotor by studying the influence of
hierarchical states on eigenfunction and level statistics.

the interacting boson model using an ensemble of random many-body interactions.
It is shown that whenever the number of bosons is sufficiently large compared
to the rank of the interactions, the spectral properties are characterized by a
dominance of L(P)=0(+) ground states and the occurrence of both vibrational and
rotational band structures. This indicates that these features represent a
general and robust property of the collective model space.

"physics/0004007","Max Bonamente","Lieu, Richard","A microscopic derivation of Special Relativity: simple harmonic
  oscillations of a moving space-time lattice","7 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.acc-ph physics.class-ph",,"  The starting point of the theory of Special Relativity$^1$ is the Lorentz
transformation, which in essence describes the lack of absolute measurements of
space and time. These effects came about when one applies the Second Relativity
Postulate to inertial observers. Here I demonstrate that there is a very
elegant way of explaining how exactly nature enforces Special Relativity, which
compels us to conclude that Einstein's great theory has already revealed
quantization of space and time. The model proposes that microscopically the
structure of space-time is analogous to a crystal which consists of lattice
points or `tickmarks' (for measurements) connected by identical `elastic
springs'. When at rest the `springs' are at their natural states. When set in
motion and used to measure objects at rest, however, the lattice effectively
vibrates in a manner described by Einstein's theory of the heat capacity of
solids, with consequent widening of the `tickmarks' because the
root-mean-square separation now increases. I associate a vibration temperature
$T$ with the speed of motion $v$ via the fundamental postulate of this theory,
viz. the relation $\frac{v^2}{c^2} = e^{-\frac{\epsilon}{kT}}$ where $\epsilon$
is a quantum of energy of the lattice harmonic oscillator. A moving observer
who measures distances with such a vibrating lattice obtains results which are
precisely those given by the Lorentz transformation. Apart from its obvious
beauty, this approach provides many new prospects in understanding space and
time. For example, a consequence of the model is that space-time, like mass,
can in principle be converted to energy.

data analysis. The main idea is to identify subsets of the genes and samples,
such that when one of these is used to cluster the other, stable and
significant partitions emerge. The search for such subsets is a computationally
complex task: we present an algorithm, based on iterative clustering, which
performs such a search. This analysis is especially suitable for gene
microarray data, where the contributions of a variety of biological mechanisms
to the gene expression levels are entangled in a large body of experimental
data. The method was applied to two gene microarray data sets, on colon cancer
and leukemia. By identifying relevant subsets of the data and focusing on them
we were able to discover partitions and correlations that were masked and
hidden when the full dataset was used in the analysis. Some of these partitions
have clear biological interpretation; others can serve to identify possible
directions for future research.

fractions of GHZ and of EPR states represent a complete quantification of their
(asymptotical) entanglement resources. More generally, we show that the three
different kinds of bipartite entanglement (AB, AC and BC EPR states) and
tripartite GHZ entanglement can be reversibly combined in a single state of
three parties. Finally, we generalize this result to any number of parties.

measurements used in previous simulations of position measurement. A number of
interesting results due to measurement are found, and the investigation casts
some light on previous disagreements about the presence or absence of the Zeno

science, although over the years a lot of its defects were signaled. These
facts justify a reinvestigation of the questions connected with the
interpretation / significance of HR. Here it is developped such a
reinvestigation starting with a revaluation of the main elements of TIHR. So
one finds that all the respective elements are troubled by insurmountable
defects. Then it results the indubitable failure of TIHR and the necessity of
its abandonment. Consequently the HR must be deprived of their quality of
crucial physical formulae. Moreover the HR are shown to be nothing but simple
fluctuations formulae with natural analogous in classical (non-quantum)
physics. The description of the maesuring uncertainties (traditionally
associated with HR) is approached from a new informational perspective. The
Planck's constant $\hbar $ (also associated with HR) is revealed to have a
significance of generic indicator for quantum stochasticity, similarly with the
role of Boltzmann's constant k in respect with the thermal stochasticity.
