of a relativistic accretion disk, and is reminiscent of double-peaked transient
Balmer emission observed in a handful of other LINERs. The very broad line
emission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, and
spatially resolved narrow-line emission in NGC 4203 can be used to constrain
its mass, with M_BH less than 6 x 10^6 solar masses at 99.7% confidence. This
value implies a ratio of black-hole mass to bulge mass of less than
approximately 7 x 10^-4 in NGC 4203, which is less by a factor of ~3 - 9 than
the mean ratio obtained for other galaxies. The availability of an independent
constraint on central black-hole mass makes NGC4203 an important testbed for
probing the physics of weak active galactic nuclei. Assuming M_BH near the
detection limit, the ratio of observed luminosity to the Eddington luminosity
is approximately 10^-4. This value is consistent with advection-dominated
accretion, and hence with scenarios in which an ion torus irradiates an outer
accretion disk that produces the observed double-peaked line emission.
Follow-up observations will make it possible to improve the black-hole mass
estimate and study variability in the nuclear emission.

fundamental structure of quasars and other jet-producing active galactic
nuclei. Rotating protogalaxies gather matter from the central gaseous region
leading to the birth of massive toroidal stars whose internal nuclear reactions
proceed very rapidly. Once the nuclear fuel is spent, gravitational collapse
produces a slender ring-shaped TBH remnant. These events are typically the
first supernovae of the host galaxies. Given time the TBH mass increases
through continued accretion by several orders of magnitude, the event horizon
swells whilst the central aperture shrinks. The difference in angular
velocities between the accreting matter and the TBH induces a magnetic field
that is strongest in the region of the central aperture and innermost
ergoregion. Due to the presence of negative energy states when such a
gravitational vortex is immersed in an electromagnetic field, circumstances are
near ideal for energy extraction via non-thermal radiation including the
Penrose process and superradiant scattering. This establishes a self-sustaining
mechanism whereby the transport of angular momentum away from the quasar by
relativistic bi-directional jets reinforces both the modulating magnetic field
and the TBH/accretion disk angular velocity differential. Quasar behaviour is
extinguished once the BH topology becomes spheroidal. Similar mechanisms may be
operating in microquasars, SNe and GRBs when neutron density or BH tori arise.
In certain circumstances, long-term TBH stability can be maintained by a
negative cosmological constant, otherwise the classical topology theorems must
somehow be circumvented. Preliminary evidence is presented that Planck-scale
quantum effects may be responsible.

terms of acceleration of protons and subsequent cascading. We discuss a
variation of the Synchrotron Proton Blazar model, first proposed by M\""ucke &
Protheroe (1999), in which the low energy part of the SED is mainly synchrotron
radiation by electrons co-accelerated with protons which produce the high
energy part of the SED mainly asproton synchrotron radiation. Using a Monte
Carlo/numerical technique to simulate the interactions and subsequent cascading
of the accelerated protons, we are able to fit the observed SED of Markarian
501 during the April 1997 flare. We find that the emerging cascade spectra
initiated by gamma-rays from $\pi^0$ decay and by $e^\pm$ from $\mu^\pm$ decay
turn out to be relatively featureless. Synchrotron radiation produced by
$\mu^\pm$ from $\pi^\pm$ decay, and even more importantly by protons, and
subsequent synchrotron-pair cascading, is able to reproduce well the high
energy part of the SED. For this fit we find that synchrotron radiation by
protons dominates the TeV emission, pion photoproduction being less important
with the consequence that we predict a lower neutrino flux than in other proton
blazar models.

temperature of the dark matter halo. It is heated by compression and shock
dissipation and is cooled by bremsstrahlung emission and conductive losses into
the cool clouds. The cool fragments are photoionized and heated by the
extragalactic UV background and nearby massive stars. The smallest clouds are
evaporated due to conductive heat transfer from the hot gas. All are subject to
disruption due to hydrodynamic instabilities. They also gain mass due to
collisions and mergers and condensation from the hot gas due to conduction. The
size distribution of the fragments in turn determines the rate and efficiency
of star formation during the early phase of galactic evolution. We have
performed one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the hot
and cool gas. The cool clouds are assumed to follow a power-law size
distribution, and fall into the galactic potential, subject to drag from the

occurs later in the optical). This is contrary to the general expectation that
light curve breaks should either be achromatic (e.g., for breaks due to
collimation effects) or should occur later at longer wavelengths (for most
other breaks). The observed color variations might be intrinsic to the
afterglow, or might indicate systematic errors of > 0.08 magnitude in all

difficulties for explanations that depend on collimated ejecta. The R light
curve shows further signs of fairly rapid variability (a bump, steep drop, and
plateau) that are not apparent in the K' light curve. In addition, by combining
the IR-optical-UV data with millimeter and radio fluxes, we are able to

29 of the SNe Ia also peak magnitudes in I are known. The SNe Ia have uniform
colors at maximum, i.e. <B-V>=-0.012 mag (sigma=0.051) and <V-I>=-0.276 mag
(sigma=0.078). In the Hubble diagram they define a Hubble line with a scatter
of $\sigma_M$=0.21-0.16 mag, decreasing with wavelength. The scatter is further
reduced if the SNe Ia are corrected for differences in decline rate Delta_m_15
or color (B-V). A combined correction reduces the scatter to sigma<=0.13 mag.
After the correction no significant dependence remains on Hubble type or
galactocentric distance. The Hubble line suggests some curvature which can be
differently interpreted. A consistent solution is obtained for a cosmological
model with Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, which is indicated also by much more
distant SNe Ia. Absolute magnitudes are available for eight equally blue
(Branch-normal) SNe Ia in spirals, whose Cepheid distances are known. If their
well defined mean values of M_B, M_V, and M_I are used to fit the Hubble line
to the above sample of SNe Ia one obtains H_0=58.3 km/s/Mpc, or, after
adjusting all SNe Ia to the average values of Delta_m_15 and (B-V), H_0=60.9
km/s/Mpc. Various systematic errors are discussed whose elimination tends to
decrease H_0. The finally adopted value at the 90-percent level, including
random and systematic errors, is H_0=58.5 +/- 6.3 km/s/Mpc. Several higher
values of H_0 from SNe Ia, as suggested in the literature, are found to depend
on large corrections for variations of the light curve parameter and/or on an

compatible with a single supermassive object without requiring it to be a black
hole. Particularly, we show that scalar stars fit very well into these
dynamical requirements. The parameters of different models of scalar stars
necessary to reproduce the inferred central mass are derived, and the possible
existence of boson particles with the adequate range of masses is commented.
Accretion to boson stars is also analyzed, and a comparison with another
non-baryonic candidate, a massive neutrino ball, which is also claimed as an
alternative to the central black hole, is given. Both models are capable to
explain the nature of the object in Sgr A$^*$ without invoking the presence of
a singularity. One difficult issue is why the accreted materials will not
finally produce, in a sufficiently long time, a black hole. We provide an
answer based on stellar disruption in the case of boson stars, and comment
several suggestions for its possible solution in neutrino ball scenarios.
Finally, we discuss the prospects for the observational detection of these

nonradial perturbations in the similarity solutions of Larson, Penston and
Yahil, which describe the evolution of the collapsing cloud prior to core
formation. Our global stability analysis reveals the existence of unstable
bar-modes ($l=2$) when $\gamma\le 1.09$. In particular, for the collapse of
isothermal spheres, which applies to the early stages of star formation, the
$l=2$ density perturbation relative to the background, $\delta\rho({\bf
r},t)/\rho(r,t)$, increases as $(t_0-t)^{-0.352}\propto \rho_c(t)^{0.176}$,
where $t_0$ denotes the epoch of core formation, and $\rho_c(t)$ is the cloud
central density. Thus, the isothermal cloud tends to evolve into an ellipsoidal
shape (prolate bar or oblate disk, depending on initial conditions) as the
collapse proceeds. In the context of Type II supernovae, core collapse is
described by the $\gamma\simeq 1.3$ equation of state, and our analysis
indicates that there is no growing mode (with density perturbation) in the
collapsing core before the proto-neutron star forms, although nonradial
perturbations can grow during the subsequent accretion of the outer core and
envelope onto the neutron star. We also carry out a global stability analysis

decomposition of the cone of divisors in Mori theory is naturally identified
with the decomposition of the G-ample cone from geometric invariant theory. In

all possible factorizations of a rational contraction can be read off from the

between the ideal states. We examine numerically the consequences of this for
radiative and leptonic decays of light mesons. The mean $\omega-\phi$ mixing
angle is found smaller than its ideal value; this is exhibited separately in

K^+ \Lambda$ in several isobaric models. These models typically include Born
terms, $K^*$- and $K_1$-exchange in the t-channel, and a few different
combinations of spin-1/2 baryon resonances in the $s$- and $u$-channels. The
coupling constants are obtained by fitting to a large data set. We find that
both pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings can allow for a satisfactory
description of the present database. The resulting coupling constants,
$g_{K\Lambda N}$ and $g_{K\Sigma N}$, in the pseudovector coupling scheme are
smaller than those predicted using flavor SU(3) symmetry, but consistent with
the values obtained in a QCD sum rule calculation.

means of a system of two real scalar fields. This model supports topological
twistons, which are described by exact and stable topological solutions that
appear when the interaction between torsional and longitudinal fields is
polynomial, containing up to the sixth power in the fields. We calculate the
energy of the topological twiston, and the result is in very good agreement
with the value obtained via molecular simulation.

geometric phase between two spins. Combined with single-spin operations, this
simple operation is a universal gate for quantum computation, in that any
unitary transformation can be implemented with arbitrary precision using only
single-spin operations and conditional phase shifts. Thus quantum geometrical
phases can form the basis of any quantum computation. Moreover, as the induced
conditional phase depends only on the geometry of the paths executed by the
spins it is resilient to certain types of errors and offers the potential of a
naturally fault-tolerant way of performing quantum computation.

  Annual ACM Symposium on Theory Of Computing.)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Unconditionally secure bit commitment and coin flipping are known to be
impossible in the classical world. Bit commitment is known to be impossible
also in the quantum world. We introduce a related new primitive - {\em quantum
bit escrow}. In this primitive Alice commits to a bit $b$ to Bob. The
commitment is {\em binding} in the sense that if Alice is asked to reveal the
bit, Alice can not bias her commitment without having a good probability of
being detected cheating. The commitment is {\em sealing} in the sense that if
Bob learns information about the encoded bit, then if later on he is asked to
prove he was playing honestly, he is detected cheating with a good probability.
Rigorously proving the correctness of quantum cryptographic protocols has
proved to be a difficult task. We develop techniques to prove quantitative
statements about the binding and sealing properties of the quantum bit escrow
protocol.
  A related primitive we construct is a quantum biased coin flipping protocol
where no player can control the game, i.e., even an all-powerful cheating
player must lose with some constant probability, which stands in sharp contrast
to the classical world where such protocols are impossible.

restored with accuracy $\epsilon$ from its rough approximation in within
$\epsilon_1$ by means of some classical algorithm. It is shown how a behavior
of system with sparse spectrum up to time $T=\frac{1-\rho}{14\epsilon}$ can be
predicted with fidelity $\rho$ on quantum computer in time
$t=\frac{4}{(1-\rho)\epsilon_1}$ plus the time of classical algorithm. The
quantum knowledge of Hamiltonian $H$ eigenvalues is considered as a wizard
Hamiltonian $W_H$ which action on any eigenvector of $H$ gives the
corresponding eigenvalue. Speedup of evolution for systems with sparse spectrum
is possible because for such systems wizard Hamiltonians can be quickly
simulated on a quantum computer. This simulation, generalizing Shor trick, is a
part of presented algorithm.
  In general case the action of wizard Hamiltonian cannot be simulated in time
smaller than the dimension of main space which is exponential of the size of
quantum system. For an arbitrary system (even for classical) its behavior
cannot be predicted on quantum computer even for one step ahead. This method
can be used also for restoration of a state of an arbitrary primary system in
time instant $-T$ in the past with the same fidelity which requires the same
time.

A 63 (2001) 012105","10.1103/PhysRevA.63.012105",,"quant-ph",,"  In Moyal's formulation of quantum mechanics, a quantum spin s is described in
terms of continuous symbols, i.e. by smooth functions on a two-dimensional
sphere. Such prescriptions to associate operators with Wigner functions, P- or
Q-symbols, are conveniently expressed in terms of operator kernels satisfying
the Stratonovich-Weyl postulates. In analogy to this approach, a discrete Moyal
formalism is defined on the basis of a modified set of postulates. It is shown
that appropriately modified postulates single out a well-defined set of kernels
which give rise to discrete symbols. Now operators are represented by functions
taking values on (2s+1)(2s+1) points of the sphere. The discrete symbols
contain no redundant information, contrary to the continuous ones. The
properties of the resulting discrete Moyal formalism for a quantum spin are
worked out in detail and compared to the continuous formalism, and it is
illustrated by the example of a spin 1/2.
