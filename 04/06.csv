magnetars by arguing that they are all rotating high-field neutron stars, but
have different orientations of their magnetic axes with respective to their
rotation axes. In strong magnetic fields where photon splitting suppresses pair
creation near the surface, the high-field pulsars can have active inner
accelerators while the anomalous X-ray pulsars cannot. This can account for the
very different observed emission characteristics of the anomalous X-ray pulsar
1E 2259+586 and the high field radio pulsar PSR J1814-1744. A predicted
consequence of this picture is that radio pulsars having surface magnetic field
greater than about $2\times 10^{14}$ G should not exist.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/309327",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a deep X-ray observation of the low-luminosity active galactic
nucleus in NGC4258 (M106) using ASCA. The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is
dominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The
hard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index
Gamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is
readily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We
also clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad
component is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from
the accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which
excites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona)
must be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many
higher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a
small 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region. It must be stressed that this study
constrains the size of the X-ray emitting corona rather than the
presence/absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk in the innermost
regions. If, instead, a substantial fraction of the observed narrow line
originates from material not associated with the accretion disk, limits can be
placed on the parameter space of possible allowed relativistically broad iron
lines. By comparing our data with previous ASCA observations, we find marginal
evidence for a change in absorbing column density through to the central
engine, and good evidence for a change in the AGN flux.

Including an external shear changes the time delay proportional to the shear
strength, and varying the radial profile of the potential changes the time
delay approximately linearly. These analytic results can be used to obtain
simple estimates of the time delay and the Hubble constant in observed
gravitational lenses. The naive estimates for four of five time delay lenses
show surprising agreement with each other and with local measurements of H_0;
the complicated Q 0957+561 system is the only outlier. The agreement suggests
that it is reasonable to use simple isothermal lens models to infer H_0,

bears the promise to reconstruct the stellar mass function. The more
interesting issue concerning the mass function is certainly to probe its low
mass end. However due to the source confusion, even if the distribution and the
kinematics of the lenses are known, the estimation of the mass function is
extremely biased at low masses. The blending due to the source confusion biases
the duration of the event, which in turn dramatically biases the estimation of
the mass of the lens. To overcome this problem we propose to use differential
photometry of the microlensing events obtained using the image subtraction
method. Differential photometry is free of any bias due to blending, however
the drawback of differential photometry is that the baseline flux is unknown.
In this paper we will show that even without knowing the baseline flux, purely
differential photometry allow to estimate the mass function without any biases.
The basis of the method is that taking the scalar product of the microlensing
light curves with a given function and taking its sum over all the microlensing
events is equivalent to project the mass function on another function. This
method demonstrates that there is a direct correspondancy between the space of
the observations and the space of the mass function. Concerning the function to
use in order to project the observations, we show that the principal components
of the light curves are an optimal set. To illustrate the method we simulate
sets consistent with the microlensing experiments. By using 1000 of these
simulations, we show that for instance the exponent of the mass function can be
reconstructed without any biases.

of the angular distance to the star.

deconvolve the images using the MCS algorithm, secondly we decompose the images

to certify whether or not continuum emission from the DLA galaxy is detected.
Continuum emission from the extended objects centred on the positions of the

``host galaxies'' of the quasars. The flux of those host galaxies is of order
2--6% of the quasar flux, and the light profile of the brighter of the two is
clearly best fit with a de Vaucouleurs profile. We discuss two alternative
interpretations of the origin of the extended flux: i) the early stage of a
massive elliptical galaxy in the process of forming the bulk of its stars, and

parameters of the WC8 star are revised to a hotter effective temperature
(Teff~57kK),a higher luminosity (log(L/Lsun = 5.00), and a lower mass loss rate
(log(Mdot / Msun/yr) = -5.0 - using a 10% clumping filling factor). These
changes lead to a significant decrease in wind efficiency number, from 144 to
7, so that the driving mechanism of the wind of this WR star may be simply
radiation pressure on lines. The derived spectroscopic luminosity is found to
be 40% lower than that derived by De Marco & Schmutz through the
mass-luminosity relationship for WR stars (log(L/Lsun = 5.2). The paper
furthermore presents a comparison of the independently-developed modelling
programs, CMFGEN and ISA-Wind . Overall, there seems to be very reasonable
agreement between the derived parameters for WR11, except for the carbon
content, which is 2 times higher for CMFGEN (C/He=0.15 vs. 0.06, by number).The
comparison also confirms a disparity in the predicted flux at lambda<$400A,
found by Crowther et al., which will have effects on several nebular line
strengths.
  The paper also presents the first independent check of the photon loss
mechanism proposed by Schmutz. We conclude that, not only is it important to
include very many lines to realistically model line blanketing, but in
particular those ones that critically interact with strong resonance lines
(e.g. HeII lambda303.78). The inclusion of these latter lines may significantly
alter the wind ionization structure.

Among all the FeN phases considered, the antiferromagnetic NaCl structure with
q=(00pi) is found to have the lowest energy at the theoretical equilibrium
volume. However, the FM NaCl phase lies only 1mRyd higher. The estimated
equilibrium lattice constant for nonmagnetic ZnS-type FeN agrees quite well
with the experimental value, but for the AFM NaCl phase the estimated value is
6.7% smaller than that observed experimentally. For ZnS-type FeN, metastable
magnetic states are found for volumes larger than the equilibrium value. On the
basis of an analysis of the atom- and orbital-projected density of states and
orbital-projected Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population, the iron-nitrogen
interactions in NM ZnS, AFM NaCl and FM CsCl structures are discussed. The
leading Fe-N interactions is due to the d-p iron-nitrogen hybridization, while
considerable s-p and p-p hybridizations are also observed in all three phases.
The iron magnetic moment in FeN is found to be highly sensitive to the
nearest-neighboring Fe-N distance. In particular, the magnetic moment shows an

together with the one generating the axial symmetry, forms the basis of a
two-dimensional Lie algebra, then the two Killing vectors must commute, thus
generating an Abelian group. In this comment a similar result, valid under
considerably weaker assumptions, is recalled: any two-dimensional Lie
transformation group which contains a one-dimensional subgroup whose orbits are
circles, must be Abelian. The method used to prove this result is extended to
apply to three-dimensional Lie transformation groups. It is shown that the
existence of a one-dimensional subgroup with closed orbits restricts the

across the membrane (that is either a brane or a shell) have to be modified if
more general equations than Einstein's, including a Gauss-Bonnet correction,
hold in the bulk, as is likely to be the case in a low energy limit of string

This paper discusses strangeness in the mean-field type of nucleon models, and
exemplifies this by explicit calculations in the MIT bag model enriched by the
presence of instantons.
  We calculate the instanton contribution to the strangeness in the MIT bag (on
top of the standard contribution to strangeness found in that model). Although
we do it in an essentially perturbative way, we present a detailed derivation
of the formula expressing nucleon matrix elements of bilinear strange quark
operators, in terms of a model valence nucleon state and interactions producing
quark-antiquark fluctuations on top of that valence state. We do it in detail
to clarify our argument that in the context of the mean-field type of quark
models (where a Fock state expansion exists and where the nucleon state can be
constructed out of single-quark states), the resulting formula acquires a
significance beyond perturbation theory.The derivation combines the usage of
the evolution operator containing a strangeness source, and Feynman-Hellmann
theorem.

y^2-4d xd t-4ud t^2, \nu=-4u_xd t$, where $u=u(x, y, t)$ satisfies the dKP
equation $(u_t-uu_x)_x=u_{yy}$.
  Linearised solutions to the dKP equation are shown to give rise to
four-dimensional anti-self-dual conformal structures with symmetries. All
four-dimensional hyper-K\""ahler metrics in signature $(++--)$ for which the
self-dual part of the derivative of a Killing vector is null arise by this
construction. Two new classes of examples of EW metrics which depend on one
arbitrary function of one variable are given, and characterised.
  A Lax representation of the EW condition is found and used to show that all
EW spaces arise as symmetry reductions of hyper-Hermitian metrics in four
dimensions. The EW equations are reformulated in terms of a simple and closed
two-form on the $\CP^1$-bundle over a Weyl space.

(two-dimensional complex manifolds ${\cal Z}$ containing a rational curve with
normal bundle $\O(2)$) that admit a section of $\kappa^{-1/4}$, where $\kappa$

amplitude as a function of the baryonic density we introduce relativistic,

baryonic states. These vector and scalar potentials were calculated using the
quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The in-medium kaon production cross sections
in pion-nucleon interactions for reaction channels with $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$
hyperons in the final state were calculated at the baryonic densities
appropriate to relativistic heavy ion collisions. Contrary to earlier work
which has not allowed for the change of the cross section in medium, we find
that the data for kaon production are consistent with a repulsive $K^+$-nucleus
potential.

exhibiting action potential duration (APD) alternans of opposite phase, appears
to be a potential mechanism for electrocardiographic T wave alternans, but its
initiation mechanism is unknown. We studied behavior of one- and two-
dimensional cardiac tissue spatially homogenous in all respects, including APD
restitution and conduction velocity restitution, using the Beeler Reuter ion
channel model. We found that discordant alternans was initiated when spatial
gradients of APD arose dynamically, such as from fixed rate pacing of a cable
end (sinus node scenario), or from fixed rate pacing at one site preceded by a
single excitation wavefront from another site (ectopic focus scenario). In the
sinus node scenario, conduction velocity restitution was necessary to initiate
discordant alternans. Alternating regimes of concordant and discordant
alternans arose along the length of the cable, with regimes delimited by nodes
of fixed APD. The number of observable nodes depended upon pacing rate and
tissue length. Differences in beat to beat conduction velocity values at steady
state were small. In the ectopic focus scenario, variable conduction velocity
was not required for induction of discrodant alternans. In both scenarios,
stability of node position was dependent upon electrotonic coupling. Other
mathematical models produced qualitatively similar results. We conclude that
spatial inhomogeneities of electrical restitution are not requiredd to produce
discordant alternans; rather, discordant alternans can arise dynamicaly from
interaction of APD and conduction veolocity resstitution with single site
pacing, or from APD restitution alone in two site pacing.

the linear superposition state can be significantly increased using presently
