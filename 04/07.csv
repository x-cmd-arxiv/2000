and colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model where
clusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. The model
assumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation rates
decline on a timescale of a few Gyrs, the typical gas consumption timescale of
disk galaxies in the field. Such behaviour might be expected if tides and ram
pressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in
spirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion
histories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a Lambda-CDM
universe, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color
distribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression
of star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric
radius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies
beyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of
the cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in
the outskirts of clusters (and as far out as two virial radii) is
systematically suppressed relative to the field. The agreement with the data
beyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that stripping
happens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the main
body of the cluster. We conclude that the star formation rates of cluster
galaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion onto
massive virialized systems, and that the cessation of star formation may have
taken place gradually over a few Gyrs.

galaxy NGC 2146 made with MERLIN and the VLA, in a search of radio supernovae
and supernova remnants expected to be already produced by the most massive
stars in the starburst. At 5 GHz, about 20 point sources were detected earlier
by Glendenning & Kronberg (1986) in the central 800 pc of NGC 2146. Our
observations with higher sensitivity and resolution made with MERLIN and the
VLA confirms the detection of 18 sources, and resolves 7 of them. Additional
1.6-GHz MERLIN observations disclose 9 sources coincident in position with
those detected at 5 GHz, which allows us to derive their spectral indices. Only
3 sources have indices consistent with synchrotron emission from supernova
remnants or radio supernovae, while the others have very steep inverted
spectra. We suggest that the sources with positive spectral index are optically
thick ultra-compact and/or ultra-dense HII regions with high electron densities
and high emission measures (EM > 10^(7) cm^(-6) pc). Minimum energy
requirements indicate that these regions may contain up to 1000 equivalent
stars of type O6. When compared with M 82, the galaxy NGC 2146 lacks however a
large number of supernova remnants. We suggest that NGC 2146 is experiencing a
burst of star formation stronger than that in M 82, but being in a younger
phase. We may, however, not exclude an alternative scenario in which strong
free-free absorption at 1.6 GHz in foreground ionized gas with very high
emission measures (EM > 10^(8) cm^(-6) pc) hides a certain number of supernova
remnants, thus rendering for some sources the observed inverted spectra.

  and improved comparison with previous work",,"10.1086/317248",,"astro-ph",,"  The bispectrum is the lowest-order statistic sensitive to the shape of
structures generated by gravitational instability and is a potentially powerful
probe of galaxy biasing and the Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations.
Although the evolution of the bispectrum is well understood theoretically from
non-linear perturbation theory and numerical simulations, applications to
galaxy surveys require a number of issues to be addressed. In this paper we
consider the effect on the bispectrum of stochastic non-linear biasing, radial
redshift distortions, non-Gaussian initial conditions, survey geometry and
sampling.
  We find that: 1) bias stochasticity does not affect the use of the bispectrum
to recover the mean biasing relation between galaxies and mass, at least for
models in which the scatter is uncorrelated at large scales. 2) radial redshift
distortions do not change significantly the monopole power spectrum and
bispectrum compared to their plane-parallel values. 3) survey geometry leads to
finite volume effects which must be taken into account in current surveys
before comparison with theoretical predictions can be made. 4) sparse sampling
and survey geometry correlate different triangles leading to a breakdown of the
Gaussian likelihood approximation.
  We develop a likelihood analysis using bispectrum eigenmodes, calculated by
Monte Carlo realizations of mock surveys generated with second-order Lagrangian
perturbation theory and checked against N-body simulations. In a companion
paper we apply these results to the analysis of the bispectrum of IRAS
galaxies.

Taking into account redshift space distortions, nonlinear evolution, the survey
selection function, and discreteness and finite volume effects, all three
catalogs show evidence for the dependence of the bispectrum on configuration
shape predicted by gravitational instability. Assuming Gaussian initial
conditions and local biasing parametrized by linear and non-linear bias
parameters b_1 and b_2, a likelihood analysis yields 1/b_1 =
1.32^{+0.36}_{-0.58}, 1.15^{+0.39}_{-0.39} and b_2/b_1^2=-0.57^{+0.45}_{-0.30},
-0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.51}, for the for the 2Jy and 1.2Jy samples, respectively.
This implies that IRAS galaxies trace dark matter increasingly weakly as the
density contrast increases, consistent with their being under-represented in
clusters. In a model with chi^2 non-Gaussian initial conditions, the bispectrum
displays an amplitude and scale dependence different than that found in the
Gaussian case; if IRAS galaxies do not have bias b_1> 1 at large scales, \chi^2
non-Gaussian initial conditions are ruled out at the 95% confidence level. The
IRAS data do not distinguish between Lagrangian or Eulerian local bias.

we observed are real over-densities of galaxies. Most clusters have velocity
dispersions appropriate for clusters of galaxies. However, we find a fraction
(1/3) of objects in the PDCS which have velocity dispersions in the range of
groups of galaxies (200 +/- 100 km/s) but have richnesses appropriate for
clusters of galaxies.
  We measure the richness function, X-ray luminosity function (using both the
detections and upper limits), and the mass function derived from our velocity
dispersions. We confirm that the space density, as a function of richness, of
clusters of galaxies in the PDCS is ~5 times that of the Abell catalog.
Excluding the above fraction of 1/3 of objects with low velocity dispersions,
we measure a space density ~3 times that of the Abell catalog for equivalent
mass clusters of galaxies. Our space density estimates are in agreement with
other low-redshift, optically-selected cluster surveys such as the EDCC, APM
and EDCC2, which raises the possibility that the Abell catalog is incomplete.
Our X-ray luminosity function agrees with other measurements based on both
X-ray and optically selected samples, so we find that the PDCS does not miss
clusters of galaxies that would be found in an X-ray selected survey. Our
resulting mass function, centered around 10e14 Msun/h, agrees with the
expectations from such surveys as the Canadian Network for Observational
Cosmology cluster survey, though errors on our mass measurements are too large
to constrain cosmological parameters.

proposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to X-rays. In this
paper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-band
optical/near-IR imaging data. The method relies upon the observation that all
rich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence
of early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain
a core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies which are coeval
and formed at high redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong
empirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity.
The fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters,
cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal
galaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all
foreground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of
a series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of
the method in detail, and contrast the method with those used by other authors.
We provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using
real redshift data, and from this conclude that the method offers a powerful
yet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. We find that the method can
reliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocity
dispersions of only ~300 km/sec, with redshifts for all detected structures
estimated to an accuracy of ~10%.

coronal loops on the determination of the vertical temperature structure $T(h)$
of the solar corona. Every method that determines an average temperature at a
particular line-of-sight from optically thin emission (e.g. in EUV or soft
X-ray wavelengths) of a mutli-temperature plasma, is subject to the emission
measure-weighted contributions $dEM(T)/dT$ from different temperatures. Because
most of the coronal structures (along open or closed field lines) are close to
hydrostatic equilibrium, the hydrostatic temperature scale height introduces a
height-dependent weighting function that causes a systematic bias in the
determination of the temperature structure $T(h)$ as function of altitude $h$.
The net effect is that the averaged temperature seems to increase with
altitude, $dT(h)/dh > 0$, even if every coronal loop (of a multi-temperature
ensemble) is isothermal in itself. We simulate this effect with differential
emission measure distributions observed by {\sl SERTS} for an instrument with a
broadband temperature filter such as {\sl Yohkoh/SXT} and find that the
apparent temperature increase due to hydrostatic weighting is of order $\Delta
T \approx T_0 \times h/r_{\sun}$. We suggest that this effect largely explains
the systematic temperature increase in the upper corona reported in recent
studies (e.g. by Sturrock et al., Wheatland et al., or Priest et al.), rather
than being an intrinsic signature of a coronal heating mechanism.

types of instabilities/overstabilities. When magnetic fields are predominantly
toroidal, as in protostellar winds, the system exhibits axisymmetric
fundamental (FM) and toroidal resonance modes, axisymmetric and
non-axisymmetric toroidal buoyancy (TB) modes, and non-axisymmetric
magnetorotational instability (MRI) modes. Winds with sufficiently steep field
gradients are unstable to the FM, which promotes narrow dense jets in the
centers of wider winds. The TB modes promote small-scale radial mixing. The
MRIs have very low growth rates under low-temperature wind conditions. The
stabilization of buoyancy modes by shear, and of MRIs by compressibility, may
be important in allowing protostellar winds to propagate over vast distances in
space. When magnetic fields are predominantly poloidal, as in winds close to
their source or in astrophysical disks, the system exhibits axisymmetric
Balbus-Hawley (BH), poloidal buoyancy (PB), non-axisymmetric geometric buoyancy
(GPB), and poloidal resonance modes. The BH mode has the fastest growth rate.
The PB mode promotes radial mixing on small scales. The GPB mode at high m is
readily stabilized by shear. We extend previous MRI analyses to focus on
compressibility. We introduce a ``coherent wavelet'' technique to derive
closed-form expressions for instantaneous instability criteria, growth rates,
and net amplification factors for non-axisymmetric MRIs in compressible flows
with both poloidal and toroidal fields. We confirm that these are in excellent
agreement with the results of shearing-sheet temporal integrations.

as the two independent parameters that specify a galaxy's location in this
``hyperplane.'' The hyperplane can be decomposed into two sub-relations: (1) a
``Z-plane,'' in which [Z/H] is a linear function of log $\sigma$ and log t; and
(2) a relation between [E/Fe] and $\sigma$ in which [E/Fe] is larger in
high-$\sigma$ galaxies. Cluster and field ellipticals follow the same
hyperplane, but their ($\sigma$,t) distributions within it differ. Nearly all
cluster galaxies are old; the field ellipticals span a large range in SSP age.
The tight Mg--$\sigma$ relations of these ellipticals can be understood as
two-dimensional projections of the metallicity hyperplane showing it edge-on;
the tightness of these relations does not necessarily imply a narrow range of
ages at fixed $\sigma$. The relation between [E/Fe] and $\sigma$ is consistent
with a higher effective yield of Type II SNe elements at higher $\sigma$. The
Z-plane is harder to explain and may be a powerful clue to star formation in
elliptical galaxies if it proves to be general. Present data favor a
``frosting'' model in which low apparent SSP ages are produced by adding a
small frosting of younger stars to an older base population. If the frosting
abundances are close to or slightly greater than the base population, simple
two-component models run along lines of constant $\sigma$ in the Z-plane, as
required. This favors star formation from well-mixed pre-enriched gas rather
than unmixed low-metallicity gas from an accreted object. (Abridged)

days) all define Leo II as an ""Oosterhoff intermediate"" galaxy. We have used
the properties of these variables to derive a metallicity for Leo II of

K and a total water column density of 1.5e18 molecules per cm squared are
inferred, each with an estimated maximum uncertainty of 20%. Combined with the
molecular hydrogen column density derived from ISO observations of the pure
rotational lines, and an assumed temperature of 200-350 K, the inferred water
abundance is 2e-4 to 5e-4 in the warm shocked gas. This abundance is similar to
that found recently by Harwit et al. (1998) toward Orion using data from the
LWS, but higher than that found for most other shocked regions by, for example,
Liseau et al. (1996).

To account for the complexity of the projected energy distribution of string

string carrying a {\em random} lineic energy distribution. In such a model we
show that, unlike the case of uniform strings, critical phenomena naturally
appear. We explore the properties of the critical lines and caustics. In
particular, assuming that the energy coherence length along the string is much
smaller than the observation scale, we succeeded in computing the total length
of critical lines per unit string length and found it to be $4/\sqrt{3} {\bf
E}(3/4)$. The length of the associated caustic lines can also be computed to be
$16/(\pi \sqrt{3}) {\bf E}(3/4)$. The picture we obtain here for the

heterogeneous, showing a substantial amount of small-scale structure in some

angle, surface brightness and colour at the radius of the circumnuclear ring in
most of our sample galaxies. In 7 out of 10 HST images, star formation in the
nuclear ring is clearly visible as a large number of small emitting regions,
organised into spiral arm fragments, which are accompanied by dust lanes. NIR
colour index maps show much more clearly the location of dust lanes and, in
certain cases, regions of star formation than single broad-band images.
Circumnuclear spiral structure thus outlined appears to be common in barred

  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  As part of a global analysis of deep star counts to constrain scenarii of
galaxy formation and evolution, we investigate possible links between the
galactic spheroid and the dark matter halo. A wide set of deep star counts at
high and intermediate galactic latitudes is used to determine the large scale
density law of the spheroid. Assuming a power density law, the exponent,
flattening, local density and IMF slope of this population are estimated. The
estimation is checked for robustness against contamination of star counts by
the thick disc population. Contamination effects are derived from a model of
population synthesis under a broad variety of thick disc parameters. The
parameter fit is based on a maximum likelihood criterion. The best fit spheroid
density law has a flattening of 0.76, a power index of 2.44. There is a
significant degeneracy between these two parameters. The data are also
compatible with a slightly less flattened spheroid (c/a = 0.85), in combination
with a larger power index (2.75). A flatter spheroid (c/a = 0.6) with a power
index of 2 is not excluded either. We also constrain the spheroid IMF slope
\alpha to be 1.9 +/- 0.2, leading to a local density of 1.64 10$^{-4}$ stars
pc$^{-3}$ and a mass density of 4.15 10$^{-5}$ \Msun pc$^{-3}$. With this slope
the expected mass density of brown dwarfs in the halo makes a negligible part
of the dark matter halo, as already estimated from microlensing surveys.
  So, as star count data progresses in depth and extent, the picture of the
spheroid star population that comes out points to a shape quite compatible with
what we know about the distribution of baryonic dark matter if it is made of
stellar remnants, suggesting a common dynamical origin.

optically among WDs detected in recent EUV All-Sky Surveys, we develop an IR
technique that probes farther down the main sequence, detecting yet more
companions. We use detailed DA model atmosphere fits to optical spectra to
predict K magnitudes and distances, against which we contrast our near-IR
observations. Our photometric survey reveals 10 DAs with a significant excess
in both J and K. Half are newly discovered, and are most likely previously
unrecognized binary systems. Neither the frequency of infrared excess nor the
mass estimate of the red dwarf companion correlate with white dwarf mass, as
might be expected if either the EUV detectability or mass of the white dwarfs
were significantly affected by a companion. Infrared spectra of these systems
should help to determine the mass and spectral type of the cool companions
presumably causing the IR excess, leading to better estimates of the mass ratio
distribution in binaries.
  Counting previously known binaries, and resolved pairs, we find the total
binary fraction of the sample is at least a third. Since most WD progenitors
had initial masses larger than about 2 solar masses, we thus provide a
photometric measure of the binary fraction of high mass stars that would be
difficult to perform in high mass main sequence stars. We estimate that 90% of
the companions are of type K or later.

determine the timescales of the gas infall into the Galactic disk ($t_{\rm

of the two timescales does not prove to be determined independently from the
SFH, we first fix $t_{\rm sf}$. Then, $t_{\rm in}$ is determined so that we
minimize $\chi^2$. Consequently, we choose three parameter sets: ($t_{\rm sf}$
[Gyr], $t_{\rm in}$ [Gyr]) = (6.0, 23), (11, 12), and (15, 9.0), where we set
the Galactic age as 15 Gyr. All of the three cases predict almost identical
star formation history. Next, we test the intermittency (or variability) of the
star formation rate (SFR) along with the smooth SFH suggested from the infall
model. The large value of the $\chi^2$ statistic supports the violent
time-variation of the SFH. If we interpret the observed SFH with smooth and
variable components, the amplitude of the variable component is comparable to
the smooth component. Thus, intermittent SFH of the Galactic disk is strongly
suggested. We also examined the metallicity distribution of G-dwarfs. We found
that the true parameter set lies between ($t_{\rm sf}$ [Gyr], $t_{\rm in}$

corrections originating from massive boson exchange can lead to significant
corrections to observable cross sections. Recently double logarithms of the
Sudakov-type were resummed for spontaneously broken gauge theories and found to
exponentiate. In this paper we use the virtual contributions to the
Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions to obtain the next to leading order kernel
of the infrared evolution equation in the fixed angle scattering regime at high
energies where particle masses can be neglected. In this regime the virtual
corrections can be described by a generalized renormalization group equation
with infrared singular anomalous dimensions. The results are valid for virtual
electroweak corrections to fermions and transversely polarized vector bosons
with an arbitrary number of external lines. The subleading terms are found to
exponentiate as well and are related to external lines, allowing for a
probabilistic interpretation in the massless limit. For $Z$-boson and $\gamma$
final states our approach leads to exponentiation with respect to each
amplitude containing the fields of the unbroken theory. For longitudinal
degrees of freedom it is shown that the equivalence theorem can be used to
obtain the correct double logarithmic asymptotics. At the subleading level,
corrections to the would be Goldstone bosons contribute which should be
considered separately. Explicit comparisons with existing one loop calculations
are made.

noncovariant perturbation theory in QED. Equation for two-particle component of
full (many-body) wave function is used, in which effective Hamiltonian depends
on the energy of a system. The effective Hamiltonian is not restricted to the
nonrelativistic region, so there is no need in any regularization. To evaluate
integrals over loop momenta, they are divided into ""hard"" and ""soft"" parts,
coming from large and small momenta respectively. Soft contributions were found
analytically, and hard ones are evaluated by numerical integration. Some soft
terms due to the retardation cancel each other. To calculate the ""hard""
contributions, a great number of noncovariant graphs is replaced by only a few
covariant ones. The hard contribution was found in two ways. The first way is
to evaluate contributions of separate graphs, using the Coulomb gauge. The
second one is to calculate full hard contribution as a whole using the Feynman
gauge. The final result for the ""recoil"" correction is $0.381(6) m\al^6$ and
agrees with those of previous papers. Diagram-to-diagram comparison with the
revised results of Adkins&Sapirstein was done. All the results agree, so the

Maxwell fields of higher rank. This system represents a generalization of the
usual electrodynamics of point particles, with one essential difference:
namely, that the world-history of a p-brane, due to the spatial extension of
the object, may possess a physical boundary. Thus, the objective of this study
is twofold: first, we wish to exploit the breaking of gauge invariance due to
the presence of a physical boundary, in order to generate mass as an
alternative to the Higgs mechanism; second, we wish to investigate how the new
mechanism of mass generation is affected by the duality transformation between
electric and magnetic branes. The whole analysis is performed by using the
path-integral method, as opposed to the more conventional canonical approach.
The advantage of the path integral formulation is that it enables us to Fourier
transform the field strength directly, rather than the gauge potential. To our
knowledge, this field strength formulation represents a new application of the
path integral method, and leads, in a straightforward way, to the dual
representation of the vacuum functional. We find that the effect of the dual
transformation is essentially that of exchanging the role of the gauge fields
defined respectively on the "" bulk'' and ""boundary"" of the p-brane history.

the exchange terms in the RPA make very difficult to find an effective residual
interaction capable of reproducing simultaneously the quasielastic peak of both

illustrated that the residual interaction used in a ring approximation must
fulfill some restrictions in order to qualitatively reproduce the full RPA

distributions. Such estimates are useful in, for example, applications of
Decision Theory and Artificial Intelligence, where inferences are made based on
uncertain knowledge. The class of algorithms that we propose is based on a
construction method that generalizes a Fredkin-Toffoli (F-T) construction
method used in the field of classical reversible computing. F-T showed how,
given any binary deterministic circuit, one can construct another binary
deterministic circuit which does the same calculations in a reversible manner.
We show how, given any classical stochastic network (classical Bayesian net),
one can construct a quantum network (quantum Bayesian net). By running this
quantum Bayesian net on a quantum computer, one can calculate any conditional
probability that one would be interested in calculating for the original
classical Bayesian net. Thus, we generalize the F-T construction method so that
it can be applied to any classical stochastic circuit, not just binary
deterministic ones. We also show that, in certain situations, our class of
algorithms can be combined with Grover's algorithm to great advantage.

which is implemented through a sequence of RF pulses, and via quantum codes
which can protect against incoherent evolution. Here, we discuss the design and
implementation of quantum codes to protect against coherent evolution. A
detailed example is given of a quantum code for protecting two data qubits from
evolution under a weak coupling (Ising) term in the Hamiltonian, using an
``isolated'' ancilla which does not evolve on the experimental time scale. The
code is realized in a three-spin system by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy on
13C-labelled alanine, and tested for two initial states. It is also shown that
for coherent evolution and isolated ancillae, codes exist that do not require
the ancillae to initially be in a (pseudo-)pure state. Finally, it is shown
that even with non-isolated ancillae quantum codes exist which can protect
against evolution under weak coupling. An example is presented for a six qubit
code that protects two data spins to first order.

state to be protected from decoherence due to external perturbations. Applied
to NMR, quantum coding does not alter normal relaxation, but rather converts
the state of a ``data'' spin into multiple quantum coherences involving
additional ancilla spins. These multiple quantum coherences relax at differing
rates, thus permitting the original state of the data to be approximately
reconstructed by mixing them together in an appropriate fashion. This paper
describes the operation of a simple, three-bit quantum code in the product
operator formalism, and uses geometric algebra methods to obtain the
error-corrected decay curve in the presence of arbitrary correlations in the
external random fields. These predictions are confirmed in both the totally
correlated and uncorrelated cases by liquid-state NMR experiments on
13C-labeled alanine, using gradient-diffusion methods to implement these
idealized decoherence models. Quantum error correction in weakly polarized
systems requires that the ancilla spins be prepared in a pseudo-pure state
relative to the data spin, which entails a loss of signal that exceeds any
potential gain through error correction. Nevertheless, this study shows that
quantum coding can be used to validate theoretical decoherence mechanisms, and
to provide detailed information on correlations in the underlying NMR
relaxation dynamics.

by showing how Euclidean spinors can be interpreted as entities in the
geometric algebra of a Euclidean vector space. This algebra is then lifted to
Minkowski space-time and its associated geometric algebra, and the insights
this provides into how density operators and entanglement behave under Lorentz
transformations are discussed. The direct sum of multiple copies of space-time
induces a tensor product structure on the associated algebra, in which a
suitable quotient is isomorphic to the matrix algebra conventionally used in
multi-qubit quantum mechanics. Finally, the utility of geometric algebra in
understanding both unitary and nonunitary quantum operations is demonstrated on
several examples of interest in quantum information processing.

entangled state via the superposition, by use of an appropriate optics, of the
spontaneous fluorescence emitted by two non-linear crystals driven by the same
pumping laser. The alignment has profitably taken advantage from the use of an
optical amplifier scheme, where a solid state laser is injected into the
crystals together with the pumping laser. In principle a very high total
quantum efficiency can be reached using this configuration and thus the final
version of this experiment can lead to a resolution of the detection loophole,
