  minor typos & updated references",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the first unambiguous case of external variability of a radio
gravitational lens, CLASS B1600+434. The VLA 8.5-GHz difference light curve of
the lensed images, taking the proper time-delay into account, shows the
presence of external variability with 14.6-sigma confidence. We investigate two
plausible causes of this external variability: scattering by the ionized
component of the Galactic interstellar medium and microlensing by massive
compact objects in the bulge/disk and halo of the lens galaxy. Based on the
tight relation between the modulation-index and variability time scale and the
quantitative difference between the light curves of both lensed images, we
conclude that the observed short-term variability characteristics of the lensed
images are incompatible with scintillation in our Galaxy. This conclusion is
strongly supported by multi-frequency WSRT observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz, which
are in strong disagreement with predictions based on the scintillation
hypothesis. ... On the other hand, a single superluminal jet-component, having
an apparent velocity 9<=(v_app/c)<=26, a radius of 2-5 micro-arcsec and
containing 5-11% of the observed 8.5-GHz source flux density, can reproduce the
observed modulation-indices and variability time scale at 8.5 GHz, when it is
microlensed by compact objects in the lens galaxy. It also reproduces the
frequency-dependence of the modulation-indices, determined from the independent
WSRT 1.4 and 5-GHz observations. ... The only conclusion fully consistent with
the data gathered thus far is that we have indeed detected radio microlensing.
The far reaching consequence of this statement is that a significant fraction
of the mass in the dark-matter halo at ~6 kpc (h=0.65) above the lens-galaxy
disk in B1600+434 consists of massive compact objects. [abridged]

radial mode number) which correspond to the Lense-Thirring frequency, evaluated
at the outer trapping radius of the mode, in the slow rotation limit. This
trapping radius is a decreasing function of the black hole angular momentum, so
a significant portion of the disk is modulated only for slowly rotating black
holes. The eigenfrequencies are thus strongly increasing functions of black

10^12 to 1.7 x 10^12 solar masses and they have more than 10^5 particles each.
A key feature of the WDM power spectrum is the free-streaming length R_f which
fixes an additional parameter for the model of structure formation. We analyze
the substructure of host halos using three R_f values: 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 Mpc
and compare results to the predictions of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. We
find that guest halos (satellites) do form in the WDM scenario but are more
easily destroyed by dynamical friction and tidal disruption than their
counterparts in a CDM model. The small number of guest halos that we find
within the virial radii of host halos at z = 0 in the WDM models is the result
of a less efficient halo accretion and a higher satellite destruction rate.
Under the assumption that each guest halo hosts a luminous galaxy, we find that
the observed circular velocity function of satellites around the Milky Way and
Andromeda is well described by the R_f = 0.1 Mpc WDM model. In the R_f =
0.1-0.2 Mpc models, the surviving subhalos at z=0 have an average concentration
parameter c_1/5 which is approximately twice smaller than that of the
corresponding CDM subhalos. This difference, very likely, produces the higher
satellite destruction rate found in the WDM models. The density profile of host
halos is well described by the NFW fit whereas guest halos show a wide variety
of density profiles (abridged).

elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, based on the HST WFPC2 archive data. We have found
about 1560 globular cluster candidates at the galactocentric radius r < 4
arcmin. V-(V-I) diagram of these objects shows a dominant vertical structure
which consists obviously of two components: blue globular clusters (BGCs) and
red globular clusters (RGCs). The luminosity function of the globular clusters
is derived to have a peak at V(max)=23.50+/-0.16 from Gaussian fitting. The
distance to NGC 4472 is estimated to be d=14.7+/-1.3 Mpc.The peak luminosity
for the RGCs is similar to that for the BGCs, which indicates that the RGCs may
be several Gyrs younger than the BGCs. The mean luminosity of the bright BGCs
decreases by 0.2 mag with increasing galactocentric radius over the range of 9
arcmin, while that of the RGCs does not. The observed color distribution of
these globular clusters is distinctively bimodal with peaks at (V-I) = 0.98 and
1.23. The mean observed color of all the globular clusters with V < 23.9 mag is
derived to be (V-I)=1.11. These colors are exactly the same as those for the
globular clusters in M87. It is found that the relative number of the BGCs to
the RGCs is increasing with the increasing galactocentric radius. Surface
number density profiles of both the BGCs and RGCs get flat in the central
region, and the core radii of the globular cluster systems are measured to be
r_c = 1.9 arcmin for the BGCs, r_c = 1.2 arcmin for the RGCs, and r_c = 1.3
arcmin for the total sample, which are much larger than the stellar core of the
galaxy. In general the properties of the globular clusters in the inner region
of NGC 4472 are consistent with those of the globular clusters in the outer

theorem. This effect, previously related to the non abelian nature of free EW
charges in the initial state (e- e+, e- p, p p ...), is here investigated for
fermion initiated hard processes and to all orders in EW couplings. We find
that the effect is important, especially for lepton initiated processes,
producing weak effects that in some cases compete in magnitude with the strong
ones. We show that this (double log) BN violating effect has a universal energy
dependence, related to the Sudakov form factor in the adjoint representation.
The role of this form factor is to suppress cross section differences within a
weak isospin doublet, so that at very large energy the cross sections for
left-handed electron-positron and neutrino-positron scattering become equal.
Finally, we briefly discuss the phenomenological relevance of our results for

interaction has been known and people have hopefully expected to understand it
as the effect of the electric polarization of the neutron. However the precise
determination of $\alpha_{n}$ in the very low energy region indicates that the
polarizability of the neutron $\alpha_{n}$ is around two order of magnitude
smaller compared to what is expected in the phenomena in the MeV. region. We
need another strong long range potential which decreases faster than $r^{-4}$.
On the other hand, analysis of the low energy proton-proton data revealed the
existence of the strong long range potential whose tail was $V(r) \sim
-C/r^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=6.08$. The neuton-nucleus scattering is a good
place to see such a force, since the strength $C$ is magnified by factor $A$,
the mass number. Using the long range parameters obtained in p-p, we predict
the characteristic angular dependency of the n-Pb amplitude for fixed energy.
Appearance of a cusp at $\nu=0$, which points upward, in the once subtracted
P-wave amplitude $a_{1}(\nu)/\nu$ is predicted.

which is free from the singularities in the neighborhood of $\nu=0$ when all

made in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with one flavor and N colors. Analysis of
the model suffers from extraordinary complexity due to the existence of a
""fermionic constraint,"" i.e., a constraint equation for the bad spinor
component. However, to solve this constraint is of special importance. In
classical theory, we can exactly solve it and then explicitly check the
property of ``light-front chiral transformation.'' In quantum theory, we
introduce a bilocal formulation to solve the fermionic constraint by the 1/N
expansion. Systematic 1/N expansion of the fermion bilocal operator is realized
by the boson expansion method. The leading (bilocal) fermionic constraint
becomes a gap equation for a chiral condensate and thus if we choose a
nontrivial solution of the gap equation, we are in the broken phase. As a
result of the nonzero chiral condensate, we find unusual chiral transformation
of fields and nonvanishing of the light-front chiral charge. A leading order
eigenvalue equation for a single bosonic state is equivalent to a leading order
fermion-antifermion bound-state equation. We analytically solve it for scalar
and pseudoscalar mesons and obtain their light-cone wavefunctions and masses.
All of the results are entirely consistent with those of our previous analysis
on the chiral Yukawa model.

The stabilization of the classical motion is reflected in the bounded evolution
of the quantum mechanical operators in the Heisenberg picture. Interesting
links with the quantum Zeno effect are discussed.
