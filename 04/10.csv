Lipowski Phys. Rev. E {\bf 60}, 6255 (1999)] with infinitely many absorbing

critical exponents and show strong evidence that this model is not in the
directed percolation universality class.
  The conjecture that this two-dimensional model exhibits a dimensional
reduction (behaving as one-dimensional directed percolation) is firmly
disproven.
  The reason for the model not exhibiting standard directed percolation scaling
behavior is traced back to the existence of what we call {\it superabsorbing
sites}, i.e. absorbing sites that cannot be directly activated by the presence
of neighboring activity in one or more than one directions.
  Supporting this claim we present two strong evidences: (i) in one dimension,
where superabsorbing sites do not appear at the critical point, the system
behaves as directed percolation, and (ii) in a modified two-dimensional
variation of the model, defined on a honeycomb lattice, for which
superabsorbing sites are very rarely observed, directed percolation behavior is
recovered. Finally, a parallel updating version of the model exhibiting a
nonequilibrium first-order transition is also reported.

transferred within the device at zero bias voltage when it is subjected to
electromagnetic radiation, thereby exciting the double dot. The excited state
can decay by transferring charge from one lead and to the other lead in one
direction. Depending on the energies of the intermediate states in the pumping
cycle, which are controlled by the gate voltages, this transport is either
incoherent via well-known sequential tunneling processes, or coherent via a
inelastic co-tunneling process. The latter novel mode of operation is possible
only when interdot Coulomb charging is important. The D.C. transport through
the system can be controlled by the frequency of the applied radiation. We
concentrate on the resonant case, when the frequency matches the energy
difference for exciting an electron from one dot into the other. The resonant
peaks in the pumping current should be experimentally observable. We have
developed a density matrix approach which describes the dynamics of the system
on timescales much larger than the period of the applied irradiation. In
contrast to previous works we additionally consider the case of slow modulation
of the irradiation amplitude. Harmonic modulation produces additional sidepeaks
in the photoresponse, and pulsed modulation can be used to resolve the Rabi

the bending and stretching moduli in a manner different from that predicted by
the macroscopic elasticity theory. We advocate a fundamental change in the
perspective regarding the dependence of elastic moduli of a flexible
polyelectrolyte on the ionic conditions: stretchability. Not only are the
persistence length as well as the stretching modulus dependent on the salt

three-dimensional space. The difficulties which appear in Bohm's theory like
the vanishing value of the conjugate momentum in the real wave function case
are surmounted. In one dimension, a new form of the general solution of the
quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation leading straightforwardly to the general form
of the Schr\""odinger wave function is proposed. For unbound states, it is shown
that the invariance of the reduced action under a dilatation plus a rotation of
the wave function in the complex space implies that microstates do not appear.
For bound states, it is shown that some freedom subsists and gives rise to the
manifestation of microstates not detected by the Schr\""odinger wave function.
