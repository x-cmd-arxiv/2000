Quasi-simultaneous radio monitoring indicates an approximately flat spectrum
from 2 - 350 GHz, although there is marginal evidence for a minimum in the
spectrum between 15 - 350 GHz. The flat spectrum and correlated variability
imply that the sub-mm emission arises from the same synchrotron source as the

self-absorbed jet, in which case these sub-mm observations probe significantly
closer to the base of the jet than do radio observations and may be used in

Observatories, was launched early in the morning of 1999, July 23 by the Space
Shuttle Columbia. The Shuttle launch was only the first step in placing the
observatory in orbit. After release from the cargo bay, the Inertial Upper
Stage performed two firings, and separated from the observatory as planned.
Finally, after five firings of Chandra's own Integral Propulsion System--- the
last of which took place 15 days after launch--- the observatory was placed in
its highly elliptical orbit of 140,000 km apogee and 10,000 km perigee. After
activation, the first x-rays focussed by the telescope were observed on 1999,
August 12. Beginning with these initial observations one could see that the
telescope had survived the launch environment and was operating as expected.
The month following the opening of the sunshade door was spent adjusting the
focus for each set of instrument configurations, determining the optical axis,
calibrating the star camera, establishing the relative response functions,
determining energy scales, and taking a series of ""publicity"" images. Each
observation proved to be far more revealing than was expected. Finally, and
despite an initial surprise and setback due to the discovery that the Chandra
x-ray telescope was far more efficient for concentrating low-energy protons
than had been anticipated, the observatory is performing well and is returning
superb scientific data. Together with other space observatories, most notably
the recently activated XMM-Newton, it is clear that we are entering a new era
of discovery in high-energy astrophysics.

further than about 65 kpc from the Galactic center. On the assumption that all
148 candidates are indeed RR Lyrae stars (contamination by other species of
variable star is probably less than 10%), we find that their volume density has
roughly a power-law dependence on galactocentric radius, 1/R^(2.7+-0.2),
between 10 and 50 kpc, and drops abruptly at R = 50-60 kpc, possibly indicating
a sharp edge to the stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae stars.

shows a clump of over 70 stars at about 45 kpc from the Galactic center. This
clump is also detected in the distribution of nonvariable objects with RR Lyrae
star colors. When sources in the clump are excluded, the best power-law fit
becomes consistent with the 1/R^3 distribution found from surveys of bright RR
Lyrae stars. These results imply that the halo contains clumpy overdensities
inhomogeneously distributed within a smooth 1/R^3 background, with a possible

mechanism of the O VI absorber and find that while theoretical considerations
favor collisional ionization, it is difficult to observationally rule out
photoionization. If the absorber is collisionally ionized, it may not be in
equilibrium due to the rapid cooling of gas in the appropriate temperature
range. Non-equilibrium collisionally ionized models are shown to be consistent
with the observations. A WIYN survey of galaxy redshifts near the sight line
has revealed a galaxy at a projected distance of 395 kpc separated by ~130 km/s

between $4 \sim 80 % $ depending on the lens location. Since the lens proper
motion can be measured for a transit event, one can distinguish whether the
lens is a MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Object) in our hal o or one of the known
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the proper motion measurement

EAGLEs in all EAGLE events signif icantly depends on the lensing locations: the
transit EAGLE fraction for the sel f-lensing case is $2 \sim 15$ times larger

calculate the effect of temperature inhomogeneities on the travel times of

the sound speed but also lengthens the path along which the wave travels
because the expansion of the heated layers shifts the upper turning of the
waves upward. Using a ray tracing approximation we find that in many cases the
net effect of a temperature enhancement is an {\it increase} of the travel
times. We argue that the reduced travel times that are observed are caused by a
combination of magnetic fields in the active region and {\it reduced}

presented. Earlier evidence of a soft excess in Mrk 509 is confirmed. This
excess is found to be better represented by a power law than by a black body:
with a photon slope of 2.5, its extrapolation matches the flux recorded in the
far UV. An ASCA observation, which appeared to exclude the presence of the
excess while showing instead evidence of a warm absorber, turns out to be
compatible with the coexistence of the excess seen with BeppoSAX and of the
warm absorber. The hard power law of Mrk 509 is seen for the first time to be
affected by a cut-off at high energies, with an e-folding energy of about 70
keV. In MCG+8-11-11 the cut-off is found at about 170 keV, consistent within
the combined errors with a previous estimate from a ASCA+OSSE/CGRO observation.
In both objects the reflection component is clearly detected. In Mrk 509 its
strength, together with that of the iron K line, indicates a solid angle Omega,
subtended by the reprocessing gas in the accretion disk, much less than 2pi,
but lacking a valid constraint on the inclination angle this evidence is not as
convincing as that found with BeppoSAX in IC 4329A. In MCG+8-11-11 the same
parameters are instead consistent with Omega=2pi, but the comparison with an
ASCA observation, when the flux level was about 2.5 times weaker, suggests that

strengths generally provides a tool to break the age-metallicity degeneracy in
elliptical galaxies. Due to the wide range of Balmer line strengths observed,
ellipticals have been interpreted to exhibit an appreciable scatter in age. In
this paper, we analyze Composite Stellar Population models with a simple mix of
an old metal-rich and an old metal-poor component. We show that these models
simultaneously produce strong Balmer lines and strong metallic lines without
invoking a young population. The key to this result is that our models are
based on SSPs that better match the steep increase of Hbeta in metal-poor
globular clusters than models in the literature. Hence, the scatter of Hbeta
observed in cluster and luminous field elliptical galaxies can be explained by
a spread in the metallicity of old stellar populations. We check our model with
respect to the so-called G-dwarf problem in ellipticals. For a galaxy subsample
covering a large range in UV-V colors we demonstrate that the addition of an
old metal-poor subcomponent does not invalidate other observational constraints
like colors and the flux in the mid-UV.

finite-temperature transfer matrix renormalization group method to evaluate the
thermodynamic properties. We find two critical points at U = $U_c$ and U =

spin-singlet exciton band develops in the BI phase (U<$U_c$) and drops below
the band gap when U exceeds a special point Ue. The exciton gap closes at the
first critical point $U_c$ while the charge and spin gaps persist and coincide
between $U_c$<U<$U_s$ where the system is dimerized. Both the charge and spin
gaps collapse at U = $U_s$ when the transition to the MI phase occurs. In the
MI phase (U>$U_s$) the charge gap increases almost linearly with U while the
spin gap remains zero. These findings clarify earlier published results on the
same model, and offer insights into several important issues regarding an
appropriate scaling analysis of DMRG data and a full physical picture of the
delicate nature of the phase transitions driven by electron correlation. The
present work provides a comprehensive understanding for the critical behavior

GUTs where the effective lepton number violating couplings immediately evolve,
while the baryon number non-conserving ones are safely projected out as the GUT
symmetry breaks down to that of the MSSM. However at the next stage, when SUSY
breaks, the radiative corrections shift the missing VEV components to some
nonzero values of order M_{SUSY}, thereby inducing the ordinary Higgs doublet
mass, on the one hand, and tiny baryon number violation, on the other. So, a

present a novel interpretation of the Schild-gauge action for strings from a

to spinodal decomposition. In contrast the fast surface explosion occurs far
outside the spinodal region and pertains also in the cases where the system

various contexts. The question arises whether such effects could be observed
with extremely weak pulses, and what would prevent the observation of an
""optical tachyon."" Aharonov, Reznik, and Stern (ARS) [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol.
81, 2190 (1998)] have argued that quantum noise will preclude the observation
of a superluminal group velocity when the pulse consists of one or a few
photons. In this paper we reconsider this question both in a general framework
and in the specific example, suggested by Chiao, Kozhekin, and Kurizki [Phys.
Rev. Lett., vol. 77, 1254 (1996)], of off-resonant, short-pulse propagation in
an optical amplifier. We derive in the case of the amplifier a signal-to-noise
ratio that is consistent with the general ARS conclusions when we impose their
criteria for distinguishing between superluminal propagation and propagation at
the speed c. However, results consistent with the semiclassical arguments of
CKK are obtained if weaker criteria are imposed, in which case the signal can
exceed the noise without being ""exponentially large."" We show that the quantum
fluctuations of the field considered by ARS are closely related to
superfluorescence noise. More generally we consider the implications of
unitarity for superluminal propagation and quantum noise and study, in addition
to the complete and truncated wavepackets considered by ARS, the residual
wavepacket formed by their difference. This leads to the conclusion that the
noise is mostly luminal and delayed with respect to the superluminal signal. In
the limit of a very weak incident signal pulse, the superluminal signal will be
dominated by the noise part, and the signal-to-noise ratio will therefore be
very small.

two-mode squeezed vacuum state. We define corresponding teleportation protocols
for each case including phase noise to model degraded entanglement of each

pulses in the Kerr medium is developed with taking into account the response
time of an electronic nonlinearity. The correspondent algebra of time-dependent
Bose-operators is elaborated. It is established that the spectral region of the
pulse, where the quadrature fluctuations level is lower than the shot-noise
one, depends on the value of the nonlinear phase shift, the intensity of
another pulse, and the relaxation time of the nonlinearity. It is shown that
the frequency of the pulse spectrum at which the suppression of fluctuations is
maximum can be controlled by adjusting the other pulse intensity.
