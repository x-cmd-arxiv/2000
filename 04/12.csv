Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) can potentially obtain unique and
precise measurements of the diffuse far-ultraviolet background. Although STIS
is not the ideal instrument for such measurements, high-resolution images allow
Galactic and extragalactic objects to be masked to very faint magnitudes, thus
ensuring a measurement of the truly diffuse UV signal. The programs we have
analyzed were not designed for this scientific purpose, but would be sufficient
to obtain a very sensitive measurement if it were not for a weak but
larger-than-expected signal from airglow in the STIS 1450-1900 A bandpass. Our
analysis shows that STIS far-UV crystal quartz observations taken near the limb
during orbital day can detect a faint airglow signal, most likely from NI\1493,
that is comparable to the dark rate and inseparable from the far-UV background.
Discarding all but the night data from these datasets gives a diffuse
far-ultraviolet background measurement of 501 +/- 103 ph/cm2/sec/ster/A, along
a line of sight with very low Galactic neutral hydrogen column (N_HI = 1.5E20

earlier measurements of the far-UV background, and should not include any
significant contribution from airglow. We present our findings as a warning to
other groups who may use the STIS far-UV camera to observe faint extended
targets, and to demonstrate how this measurement may be properly obtained with

(1993). She used a percolation and a hierarchical method, and proposed a third
group catalog defined as a combination of the two. Each catalog contains almost
500 groups. In agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find that
groups can be described as collapsing systems. Their sampled size is much
larger than their expected virialized region. We compute the virial masses and
correct them by taking into account the young dynamical status. We estimate
group masses, M, for two cosmological models, a flat one with Omega_0=1 and an
open one with Omega_0=0.2. For each of the three catalogs we calculate the mass
function, MF. The number density of groups with M>9x10^{12}\msun, which is the
adopted limit of sample completeness, ranges within 1.3-1.9x10^{-3}h^3/Mpc^3
for Omega_0=1, and it is about a factor of 15% lower for Omega_0=0.2. The MFs
of the hierarchical and combined catalogs have essentially the same shape,
while the MF of the percolation catalog shows a flattening towards large
masses. However, the difference decreases if we do not consider the most
massive groups, for which reliable results come from galaxy cluster studies.
After having estimated the mass contained within the central, presumably
virialized, regions of groups by adopting a reduction in mass of 30-40%, we do
a comparison with the results coming from the virial analysis of nearby rich
clusters (Girardi et al. 1998). All three group MFs turn out to be a smooth
extrapolation of the cluster MF at M<4x10^{14}\msun, which is the completeness
limit of the cluster sample. The resulting optical virial MF of galaxy systems,
which extends over two orders of magnitude, is fitted to a Schechter expression
with a slope of about -1.5 and a characteristic mass of about 3x10^{14}\msun.

Bajtlik, Duncan, and Ostriker (1988) permits an estimate of the mean intensity

hypothetical zincblende structure. A zincblende structure can be obtained, in
principle, from the diluted magnetic semiconductor Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As in the
limit $x=1$. Using density functional calculations within the local
spin-density approximation (LSDA), we show that the zincblende structure,
although showing half metallic behavior which is very attractive for
spintronics, can not be stabilized at equilibrium. We perform a tight-binding
analysis of the Mn-As bond in the tetrahedral coordination to investigate the
nature of the bonding in diluted magnetic semiconductors.

equal percentages of Sr and Zn. The mobile holes (MH) are trapped by the NMI
and the system remains insulating and commensurate with antiferromagnetic (AF)
correlations. This behavior persists in the region %NMI > %MH. On the other
hand, when %NMI < %MH magnetic and charge incommensurabilities are observed.
The vertical or horizontal hole-rich stripes, present when % NMI=0 upon hole
doping, are pinned by the NMI and tend to become diagonal, surrounding finite
AF domains. The %MH-%NMI plane is investigated. Good agreement with

A 62, 012108 (2000).","10.1103/PhysRevA.62.012108",,"quant-ph",,"  We have revisited the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber-Pearle (GRWP) approach for
continuous dynamical evolution of the state vector for a macroscopic object.
Our main concern is to recover the decoupling of the state vector dynamics for
the center-of-mass (CM) and internal motion, as in the GRWP model, but within
the framework of the standard cosmology. In this connection we have taken the
opposite direction of the GRWP argument, that the cosmic background radiation
(CBR) has originated from a fundamental stochastic hitting process. We assume
the CBR as a clue of the Big Bang, playing a main role in the decoupling of the
state vector dynamics of the CM and internal motion. In our model, instead of
describing a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) of a system of massive
particles as proposed by Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini, the It\^{o} stochastic
equation accounts for the intervention of the CBR on the system of particles.
Essentially, this approach leads to a pre-master equation for both the CBR and
particles degrees of freedom. The violation of the principle of energy
conservation characteristic of the CSL model is avoided as well as the
additional assumption on the size of the GRWP's localization width necessary to
reach the decoupling between the collective and internal motions. Moreover,
realistic estimation for the decoherence time, exhibiting an interesting
dependence on the CBR temperature, is obtained. From the formula for the
decoherence time it is possible to analyze the transition from micro to macro
dynamics in both the early hot Universe and the nowadays cold one. The entropy
of the system under decoherence is analyzed and the emergent `pointer basis' is
discussed. In spite of not having imposed a privileged basis, in our model the
position still emerges as the preferred observable as in the CSL model.

the attractiveness of nuclear spins as information-bearing entities, and light
for the coupling which allows quantum gates. We then survey the strengths of

discuss decoherence and gate rates in ion traps, comparing methods based on the
vibrational motion with a method based on exchange of photons in cavity QED. We
then sketch the main features of a quantum computer designed to allow an
algorithm needing 10^6 Toffoli gates on 100 logical qubits. We find that around
200 ion traps linked by optical fibres and high-finesse cavities could perform
such an algorithm in a week to a month, using components at or near current
levels of technology.

through a slight modification of the standard teleportation procedure is
studied. It is shown that it is not possible to perform successful
teleportation of an arbitrary and unknown two-particle entangled state,
following our version of the standard teleportation procedure. On the contrary,
it is shown which, and in how many different ways, particular classes of
two-particle states can be teleported.
