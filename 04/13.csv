mostly of HII galaxies and Starbursts, as well as some Seyfert 2s, and
determine chemical and physical parameters. The data consist of 19 high
signal-to-noise ratio optical templates, a result of grouping 185 emission line
galaxy spectra. Underlying stellar population models were subtracted from the
templates in order to isolate the pure emission component. We analyse the
distribution of these improved signal-to-noise ratio emission spectra in
diagnostic diagrams and find that the HII templates show a smaller spread in
log([OIII]/H\beta) values than the individual galaxies, apparently due to the
population subtraction and better signal-to-noise ratio. We thus suggest the
template sequence as a fiducial observational locus for HII galaxies which can
be used as reference for models. The sequence of line ratios presented by the
HII galaxies in the diagram log([OIII}]\lambda5007/H\beta) X
log([NII]\lambda6584/H\alpha) is primarily due to the gas metallicity, of which
the log([NII]/H\alpha) ratio is a direct estimator. We also study the
properties of the Starburst galaxies and those intermediate between HII and
Starburst galaxies, which are more metal rich and sit on more massive galaxies.
We discuss the present results in the frame of a recently proposed equivalent
width diagnostic diagram for emission line galaxies and conclude that the
observed ranges in W([OII])/W(H\beta) and W(H\beta) are mostly due to the
non-ionizing stellar population contribution. W(H\beta) can be used as an
estimator of this contribution to the continuum, and briefly discuss
implications to the cosmological use of HII galaxies.

applied at optical wavelengths, and can provide reliable total masses for
intermediate redshift clusters. Using the maximum likelihood technique
developed by Schneider, King & Erben (1999), we detect the gravitational
depletion at the 3 sigma confidence level. By modeling the mass distribution as
a singular isothermal sphere and ignoring uncertainty in the unlensed number
counts, we find an Einstein radius of 13.7 +3.9/-4.2 arcsec (66% confidence

800 km/s, in agreement with constraints from strongly-lensed features. For a
Navarro, Frenk and White mass model, the radial dependence observed indicates a
best-fitting halo scale length of 125/h kpc}. We investigate the uncertainties
arising from the observed fluctuations in the unlensed number counts, and show
that clustering is the dominant source of error. We extend the maximum
likelihood method to include the effect of incompleteness, and discuss the

contamination of cluster non-members found in this work. We find a
contamination level of 33% among the brown dwarf candidates identified by
Bouvier et al. (1998). Assuming a power law IMF across the substellar boundary,
we find a slope dN/dM ~ M^{-0.53}, implying that the number of objects per mass

substantial flux in the 60 and 100 micron channels in excess of expected
zodiacal and Galactic emission. Two methods are used to separate zodiacal light
from more distant emission. Method I makes use of the time-dependence of the
North-South annual variation observed at the ecliptic poles. This method is
robust against errors in the inter-planetary dust (IPD) model, but does not
demonstrate isotropy of the background. Method II measures the ecliptic
latitude dependence of the dust over a range of ecliptic latitudes at solar
elongation e=90 degrees. This allows the excess to be determined in each week
of the DIRBE mission for high redundancy, but the results depend weakly on the
IPD model. Both methods give consistent results at 60 and 100 microns. The
observed signal is consistent with an isotropic background at the level \nu
I_\nu = 28.1 +- 1.8 +- 7(syst) nW/m^2/sr at 60 microns and 24.6 +- 2.5 +- 8

previous measurements, which are thought to be the cosmic infra-red background
(CIB). The detections at 60 and 100 microns are new. While this new excess is
not necessarily the CIB, we have ruled out all known sources of emission in the
solar system and Galaxy. We therefore tentatively interpret this signal as the
CIB and consider the implications of such energy production from the viewpoint
of star formation efficiency and black hole accretion efficiency. However, the
IR excess exceeds limits on the CIB derived from the inferred opacity of the
IGM to observed TeV photons, thus casting doubt on this interpretation. There
is currently no satisfactory explanation for the 60-100 micron excess.

to be further confirmed with more events. We present the details of converting
GRB observables to luminosities and redshifts for 220 bright, long GRBs from

consequences. In particular, we derive the GRB rate as a function of $z$

formation, then our results indicate that the SFR does not peak at z\sim 2 but
instead continues to increase until z \sim 10. We have used the burst formation
rate to correct the observed GRB luminosity function for the incompleteness due
to the detection threshold, resulting in a luminosity function with a power law
index of \sim -2.3 that slightly rolls over at low luminosities. The reality of
our variability--luminosity relationship requires confirmation but, if valid,
will provide a powerful tool for studying both GRBs and the early universe.

hours (~ 2.65 days). It transits the Earth's Van Allen belts once per orbit
during which no science observations can be performed due to the high radiation
environment. The Chandra X-ray Observatory Center (CXC) currently uses the
National Space Science Data Center's ``near Earth'' AP-8/AE-8 radiation belt
model to predict the start and end times of passage through the radiation
belts. However, our scheduling software uses only a simple dipole model of the
Earth's magnetic field. The resulting B, L magnetic coordinates, do not always
give sufficiently accurate predictions of the start and end times of transit of
the Van Allen belts. We show this by comparing to the data from Chandra's
on-board radiation monitor, the EPHIN (Electron, Proton, Helium Instrument
particle detector) instrument. We present evidence that demonstrates this
mis-timing of the outer electron radiation belt as well as data that also
demonstrate the significant variablity of one radiation belt transit to the
next as experienced by the CXO. We also present an explanation for why the
dipole implementation of the AP-8/AE-8 model is not ideally suited for the CXO.
Lastly, we provide a brief discussion of our on-going efforts to identify a

to a decrease in the TMR amplitude due to excitation of spin-flip processes
resulting in mixing of spin up and down channels. It is also shown that
asymmetry in the location of the impurities within the barrier can lead to
asymmetry in $I(V)$ characteristics of impurity assisted current and two
mechanisms responsible for the origin of this effect are established. The first
one is due to the excitation of spin-flip processes at low voltages and the
second one arises from the shift of resonant levels inside the insulator layer

crystallographic axis (c-axis) is the easy axis of magnetization. The
reversible reorientation of the easy magnetization direction of martensite
samples after 5% compression is found. The same reversible reorientation of the
easy magnetization direction under applied magnetic field occurs in the
single-crystal samples. The field-induced reorientation of the easy
magnetization direction is accompanied with more than 4% of sample's dimension
change. About the same value of the field-induced strains can be obtained for
polycrystalline samples after appropriate thermo-mechanical treatment.

groups by using O3-planes. An essential ingredient in constructing the mirror
is the splitting of a physical brane (NS-brane or D5-brane) on O3-planes. In
particular, matching the dimensions of moduli spaces of mirror pair (for
example, the SO(2k+1) and its mirror) there is a D3-brane creation or
annihilation accompanying the splitting. This novel dynamical process gives a
nontrivial prediction for strongly coupled field theories, which will be very
interesting to check by Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, applying the same
idea, we revisit the mirror theory of Sp(k) gauge group and find new mirrors
which differ from previously known results. Our new result for Sp(k) gives
another example to a previously observed fact, which shows that different
theories can be mirror to the same theory. We also discussed the phenomena such
as ""hidden FI-parameters"" when the number of flavors and the rank of the gauge
group satisfy certain relations, ``incomplete Higgsing'' for the mirror of
SO(2k+1) and the ``hidden global symmetry''. After discussing the mirror for a
single Sp or SO gauge group, we extend the study to a product of two gauge

minimizing submodular set functions, answering an open question posed in 1981
by Grotschel, Lovasz, and Schrijver. The algorithm employs a scaling scheme
that uses a flow in the complete directed graph on the underlying set with each
arc capacity equal to the scaled parameter. The resulting algorithm runs in
time bounded by a polynomial in the size of the underlying set and the largest
length of the function value. The paper also presents a strongly
polynomial-time version that runs in time bounded by a polynomial in the size
of the underlying set independent of the function value.

"math/0004090","Alexander Karzanov","Alexander V. Karzanov","How to Uncross Some Modular Metrics","25 pages",,,"FI-GT1999-003","math.CO",,"  Let $\mu$ be a metric on a set T, and let c be a nonnegative function on the
unordered pairs of elements of a superset $V\supseteq T$. We consider the
problem of minimizing the inner product $c\cdot m$ over all semimetrics m on V
such that m coincides with $\mu$ within T and each element of V is at zero
distance from T (a variant of the {\em multifacility location problem}). In
particular, this generalizes the well-known multiterminal multiway) cut
problem. Two cases of metrics $\mu$ have been known for which the problem can
be solved in polynomial time: (a) $\mu$ is a modular metric whose underlying
graph $H(\mu)$ is hereditary modular and orientable (in a certain sense); and
(b) $\mu$ is a median metric. In the latter case an optimal solution can be
found by use of a cut uncrossing method. \Xcomment{We give a common
generalization for both cases by proving that the problem is in P for any
modular metric $\mu$ whose all orbit graphs are hereditary modular and
orientable. To this aim, we show the existence of a retraction of the Cartesian
product of the orbit graphs to $H(\mu)$, which enables us to elaborate an
analog of the cut uncrossing method for such metrics $\mu$.} In this paper we
generalize the idea of cut uncrossing to show the polynomial solvability for a
wider class of metrics $\mu$, which includes the median metrics as a special
case. The metric uncrossing method that we develop relies on the existence of
retractions of certain modular graphs. On the negative side, we prove that for
$\mu$ fixed, the problem is NP-hard if $\mu$ is non-modular or $H(\mu)$ is
non-orientable.

  non-Abelian Gauge Field Must satisfy and Elimination of Higgs Mechanism","13 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the current theory of non-Abelian gauge field, we only claim the
invariability of Lagrangian, without claim the invariability of the motion
equation. This is inconsistent and irrational. It is proved that a restriction
relation between gauge potentials and group parameters must be satisfied in
order to ensure the gauge invariability of the motion equation of non-Abelian
gauge field, and the restriction relation is equivalent to the Faddeev--Popov
theory. The result leads to that the completely local gauge invariability is
violated but there still exists the incompletely local gauge invariability.
After the restriction relation is considered, the mass item of the non-Abelian
gauge fields can be added into the Lagrangian and motion equation directly
without violating gauge invariability. The corresponding W,T identity is
obtained and the theory is still renormalizable. In this way, the Higgs
mechanism becomes unnecessary. It means that we can reach a coincident theory
without the hypothesis of the Higgs particles again. The description of the
stander theory of particle physics can also be simplified greatly and the
problem of CP violation in strong interaction can also be solved thoroughly.

transformation that relates an accelerated and an inertial observer we find
that, from the point of view of the accelerated observer, the rate of the
differential lapses of time depends not only on the relative velocity, but also
on the product of the acceleration and the distance between the observers.
However, this result does not have a direct operational interpretation because
an observer at a certain position can measure only physical quantities that are
defined at the same position. For local measurements, the asymmetry between the
two observers can be attributed to the fact that noninertial coordinate
systems, contrary to inertial coordinate systems, can be correctly interpreted
only locally.

which this methodology can be put. One that has received particular attention
is in the construction of certain distinguished (Bures) measures on the $(n^2

associated to the dynamical Casimir effect. We also show that decoherence is a
consequence of the entanglement between the quantum states of the oscillator
and field two-photon states. With the help of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, we derive a relation between decoherence and damping rates valid for
arbitrary values of the temperature of the field. Coherent states are selected

= \sqrt{m^{2} + p^{2}}. This relation was formulated in 1905 for point
particles. Since then, particles have become more complicated. They have
internal space-time structures. Massive particles carry the package of internal
variables including mass, spin and quarks, while massless particles have the
package containing helicity, gauge variables, and partons. The question then is
whether these two different packages of variables can be unified into one
single covariant package as E = mc^{2} does for the energy-momentum relations
for massive and massless particles. The answer to this question is YES.
