the Local Group. The evidence comes from estimates of the total mass of the
Andromeda galaxy (M31) derived from the three dimensional positions and radial
velocities of its satellite galaxies, as well as the projected positions and
radial velocities of its distant globular clusters and planetary nebulae. The
available dataset comprises ten satellite galaxies, seventeen distant globular
clusters and nine halo planetary nebulae with radial velocities. We find the
halo of Andromeda has a mass of about 12 x 10^11 solar masses, together with a
scalelength of roughly 90 kpc and a predominantly isotropic velocity
distribution. For comparison, our earlier estimate for the Milky Way halo is 19
x 10^11 solar masses. Though the error bars are admittedly large, this suggests
that the total mass of M31 is probably less than that of the Milky Way. We
verify the robustness of our results to changes in the modelling assumptions
and to errors caused by the small size and incompleteness of the dataset.
Future prospects using radial velocity surveys of globular clusters and
planetary nebulae, as well as microarcsecond astrometry from the upcoming
satellite missions, are discussed.

Keplerian ellipses. The pair of ellipses that outline a given ring share a
common line of apsides. Apse alignment is surprising because the quadrupole
moment of Uranus induces differential precession. We propose that rigid
precession is maintained by a balance of forces due to ring self-gravity,
planetary oblateness, and interparticle collisions. Collisional impulses play
an especially dramatic role near ring edges. Pressure-induced accelerations are
maximal near edges because there (1) velocity dispersions are enhanced by
resonant satellite perturbations, and (2) the surface density declines steeply.
Remarkably, collisional forces felt by material in the last 100 m of a 10 km
wide ring can increase equilibrium masses up to a factor of 100. New ring
surface densities are derived which accord with Voyager radio measurements. In
contrast to previous models, collisionally modified self-gravity appears to
allow for both negative and positive eccentricity gradients; why all narrow

thermal and non-thermal particles, on the synchrotron spectrum, image size, and
image shape of a hot accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole. We find two
universal features in the emitted synchrotron spectrum: (i) a prominent
shoulder at low (< 10^11 Hz) frequencies that is weakly dependent on the shape
of the electron energy distribution, and (ii) an extended tail of emission at
high (> 10^13 Hz) frequencies whose spectral slope depends on the slope of the
power-law energy distribution of the electrons. In the low-frequency shoulder,
the luminosity can be up to two orders of magnitude greater than with a purely
thermal plasma even if only a small fraction (< 1%) of the steady-state
electron energy is in the non-thermal electrons. We apply the hybrid model to
the Galactic center source, Sgr A*. The observed radio and IR spectra imply
that at most 1% of the steady-state electron energy is present in a power-law
tail in this source. This corresponds to no more than 10% of the electron
energy injected into the non-thermal electrons and hence 90% into the thermal
electrons. We show that such a hybrid distribution can be sustained in the flow
because thermalization via Coulomb collisions and synchrotron self-absorption
are both inefficient. The presence of non-thermal electrons enlarges the size
of the radio image at low frequencies and alters the frequency dependence of
the brightness temperature. A purely thermal electron distributions produces a
sharp-edged image while a hybrid distribution causes strong limb brightening.
These effects can be seen up to frequencies ~10^11 Hz and are accessible to
radio interferometers.

ADAF(advection-dominated accretion flow) model is well above the observations.
If the mass accretion rate favored by the numerical simulation were adopted,
the ADAF model would also significantly overpredict the radio flux of Sgr A*.
On the observational side, strong evidence for the existence of jets in Sgr
A$^*$ and these ellipticals has been obtained. Based on these facts, we propose
a truncated ADAF model for these sources. We assume that the accretion disk is
truncated at a certain radius within which a jet forms by extracting the energy
of the disk therefore the radio flux is greatly suppressed due to the radiative
truncation of the disk and the fits to the observational data are excellent.
For example, for Sgr A*, the model fits the spectrum very well from radio
including the ``excess'' below the break frequency to hard X-ray under a high
accretion rate near the simulation value; for M87, the predicted upper limit of
the jet location is 24 $R_g$, in excellent agreement with the observational
result of < 30 $R_g$. The success of the model supplies a possible piece of
evidence for the disk rather than the hole origin for the powering of jets.

that by placing a second star on the slit we can correct for the telluric
absorption bands which have hitherto made the TiO features from the secondary
star unusable. We use these TiO features to carry out a radial velocity study
of the secondary star, and find this gives an improvement in signal-to-noise of
a factor two compared with using the Na{I} doublet. In contrast with previous
results, we find no apparent ellipticity in the radial velocity curve. As a
result we revise the semi-amplitude to 331.3+/-5.8km/s, and thus the primary
and secondary star masses to 1.05Mo and 0.33Mo respectively. Although this is
the lowest mass yet derived for the secondary star, it is still over-massive
for its observed spectral type. However, the revised mass and radius bring IP
Peg into line with other CVs in the mass-radius-period relationships.
  By fitting the phase resolved spectra around the TiO bands to a mean
spectrum, we attempt to isolate the lightcurve of the secondary star. The
resulting light curve has marked deviations from the expected ellipsoidal
shape. The largest difference is at phase 0.5, and can be explained as an
eclipse of the secondary star by the disc, indicating that the disc is

of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence (MS). The
internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion,
meridional circulation, diffusion processes and mass loss. In turn,
differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion,
so that a consistent treatment is necessary.
  We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the
surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper MS, for red giants,
supergiants and W-R stars. A fast rotation is enhancing the mass loss by
stellar winds and reciprocally high mass loss is removing a lot of angular
momentum. The problem of the ``break-up'' or $\Omega$-limit is critically
examined in connection with the origin of Be and LBV stars. The effects of
rotation on the tracks in the HR diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the
blue to red supergiant ratios, the formation of W-R stars, the chemical
abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and AGB stars, are
reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and
Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the
chemical yields are examined, as well as the constraints placed by the periods
of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not
only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity $\Omega$
as well.

possible: polydisperse hard spheres. Monodisperse hard spheres cannot be
studied as the slow down in dynamics as the density is increased is preempted
by crystallisation. As the dynamics slow they become more heterogeneous, the
spread in the distances traveled by different particles in the same time
increases. However, the dynamics appears to be less heterogeneous than in
hard-sphere-like colloids at the same volume fraction. The particles which move
least far in a characteristic relaxation time and, particularly, the particles
which move farthest in the same time are clustered, not randomly distributed
throughout the sample. We study the dynamics at three different widths of the
distribution of diameters of the hard spheres. For each width, the relaxation
time is the same function of the compressibility factor, suggesting that this
determines the relaxation time for hard spheres.

exists a field driven phase transition . The transition field increases with
decreasing temperature. In the field-temperature phase diagram, the phase
transition line is obtained theoretically by a combined use of a variational

a diffeomorphism-invariant Lagrangian. The mathematical structure is a Noether-
current construction of Wald involving the boundary term in the action, but
here it is argued that the physical interpretation of current conservation is
conservation of energy. This leads to a quasi-local energy defined for compact
spatial surfaces. The energy also depends on a vector generating a flow of
time. Angular momentum may be similarly defined, depending on a choice of axial
vector. For Einstein gravity: for the usual vector generating asymptotic time
translations, the energy is the Bondi energy; for a stationary Killing vector,
the energy is the Komar energy; in spherical symmetry, for the Kodama vector,
the energy is the Misner-Sharp energy. In general, the lack of a preferred time
indicates the lack of a preferred energy, reminiscent of the energy-time

functional in the space of field configurations for which the variation of the
action is well defined. Since these field configurations are not required to
vanish outside a bounded domain, there is generally a non-vanishing
contribution of a surface term to the variation of the action. We then
investigate whether this surface term has an effect on the dynamics of the
action-extremizing field configurations. This question appears to be
surprisingly nontrivial in the case of the open FLRW geometry, since surface
terms tend to grow as fast as volume terms in the infinite volume limit. We
find that surface terms can be important for the dynamics of the field at a
classical and at a quantum level, when there are supercurvature perturbations.

possesses metastable skyrmions. We use relaxation techniques to determine the
size, shape and energy of static solitons in their ground state. These solitons
could decay by quantum mechanical tunneling. Classically, they are metastable:
only a finite excitation energy is required to induce their decay. We attempt
to induce soliton decay in a classical simulation by colliding pairs of
solitons. We analyze the collision of solitons with varying inherent
stabilities and varying incident velocities and orientations. Our results
suggest that winding-number violating decay is a generic outcome of collisions.
All that is required is sufficient (not necessarily very large) incident
velocity; no fine-tuning of initial conditions is required.

stadium billiard. The localization of individual eigenfunctions in Husimi phase
space is studied first, and it is demonstrated that on average there is more
localization than can be accounted for on the basis of random-matrix theory,
even after removal of bouncing-ball states and visible scars. A major point of
the paper is that symmetry considerations, including parity and time-reversal
symmetries, enter to influence the total amount of localization. The properties
of the local density of states spectrum are also investigated, as a function of
phase space location. Aside from the bouncing-ball region of phase space,
excess localization of the spectrum is found on short periodic orbits and along
certain symmetry-related lines; the origin of all these sources of localization
is discussed quantitatively and comparison is made with analytical predictions.
Scarring is observed to be present in all the energy ranges considered. In
light of these results the excess localization in individual eigenstates is
interpreted as being primarily due to symmetry effects; another source of
excess localization, scarring by multiple unstable periodic orbits, is smaller
by a factor of $\sqrt{\hbar}$.

view of evolution which assigns effective fitness to each allele instead of
each organism. The gene centered view can be formalized as a dynamic mean field
approximation applied to genes in reproduction / selection dynamics. We show
that the gene centered view breaks down for symmetry breaking and pattern
formation within a population; and show that spatial distributions of organisms
with local mating neighborhoods in the presence of disruptive selection give
rise to such symmetry breaking and pattern formation in the genetic composition
of local populations. Global dynamics follows conventional coarsening of

(WEP) of general relativity using a new quantum gravity theory proposed by the
authors called Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity or EMQG (ref. 1). Newtonian
Inertia is a property of matter due to the strictly local electrical force
interactions contributed by each of the (electrically charged) elementary
particles of the mass with the surrounding (electrically charged) virtual
particles (virtual masseons) of the quantum vacuum. The sum of all the tiny
electrical forces (photon exchanges with the vacuum particles) originating in
each charged elementary particle of the accelerated mass is the source of the
total inertial force of a mass which opposes accelerated motion in Newton's law
'F = MA'. We found that gravity also involves the same 'inertial'
electromagnetic force component that exists in inertial mass. We propose that
Einstein's general relativistic Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) originates
from common 'lower level' quantum vacuum processes occurring in both inertial
mass and gravitational mass, in accordance with the principles of quantum field
theory. Gravitational mass results from the quantum activities of both the
electrical force (photon exchanges) component and the pure gravitational force
(graviton exchanges) component, acting simultaneously on the elementary
particles that make up a mass.
