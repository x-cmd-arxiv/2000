limited magnitude-redshifts catalogues, using the luminosity function of the
sources as a distance indicator.The method is characterised by its robustness.
In particular, no assumptions are made concerning the spatial distribution of
sources and their luminosity function. Moreover, selection effects in redshift
are allowed. Furthermore the inclusion of additional observables correlated
with the absolute magnitude -- such as for example rotation velocity
information as described by the Tully-Fisher relation -- is straightforward.
  As an illustration of the method, the predicted IRAS peculiar velocity model
characterised by the density parameter beta is tested on two samples. The
application of our method to the Tully-Fisher MarkIII MAT sample leads to a
value of beta=0.6 \pm 0.125, fully consistent with the results obtained
previously by the VELMOD and ITF methods on similar datasets. Unlike these
methods however, we make a very conservative use of the Tully-Fisher
information. Specifically, we require to assume neither the linearity of the
Tully-Fisher relation nor a gaussian distribution of its residuals. Moreover,
the robustness of the method implies that no Malmquist corrections are
required.
  A second application is carried out, using the fluxes of the IRAS 1.2 Jy
sample as the distance indicator. In this case the effective depth of the
volume in which the velocity model is compared to the data is almost twice the
effective depth of the MarkIII MAT sample. The results suggest that the
predicted IRAS velocity model, while successful in reproducing locally the
cosmic flow, fails to describe the kinematics on larger scales.

to have formed together. Here we present a study of three binary cluster
candidates which are located in the bar of the LMC. NGC 1971 & NGC 1972 are
situated in the association LH 59 in the eastern part of the bar. A third star
cluster, NGC 1969, is close enough to this pair that all three objects may
constitute a triple system. We present the first age determination that is
based on CMDs for these star clusters. Our findings suggest that all three
clusters are young (40-70 Myr) and may have been formed in the same GMC. It
cannot clearly decided whether the clusters are physically interacting or not.
NGC 1894 & SL 341 are located at the south-western rim of the LMC bar. This
pair is studied in detail for the first time: The isopleths of both clusters
reveal an elliptical shape. Whether this might be interpreted as a sign of
interaction or is a peculiarity which is shared with a large amount of LMC star
clusters which show higher ellipticities than their counterparts in the Milky
Way remains unclear. From our age determination we find that both clusters are
coeval with an age of 55+/-5 Myr. This makes a formation from the same GMC a
likely scenario. SL 385 & SL 387 are a close pair in the western part of the
LMC bar. We derived ages of 170+/-30 Myr for SL 385 and >=250 Myr for SL 387.
The large age difference makes it unlikely that these two clusters formed in
the same GMC.

using improved stellar age estimates that are based on Hipparcos parallaxes and
recent stellar evolution calculations. The resulting relation shows that the
Milky Way stellar disk was relatively quiescent, suffering little heating or
dispersion increase between 3 and 9 Gyrs. However, at an age of 9 Gyrs there is
an abrupt increase in the stellar velocity dispersions. To explain the abrupt
increase (by almost a factor of 2) in dispersions we propose that the Milky Way
suffered a minor merger 9 Gyrs ago that created the thick disk. The quiescent
phase is consistent with inefficient heating caused by scattering from tightly
wound transient spiral structure. It is possible that many galaxy disks have
radial velocity dispersions at the point where heating from spiral structure
becomes inefficient. Surface brightness profiles and dispersion measurements
can be used to predict spiral arm winding numbers at this saturation point. A
comparison between the observed and predicted winding numbers could test this
hypothesis and also search for evidence of merger induced disk heating in
nearby galaxies.

Poynting flux drives non-linearly unstable large amplitude electromagnetic
waves (LAEMW) which ``break'' at radii $r_t \sim 10^{14} $ cm where the MHD
approximation becomes inapplicable. In the ``foaming'' (relativisticly
reconnecting) regions formed during the wave breaks the random electric fields
stochastically accelerate particles to ultrarelativistic energies which then
radiate in turbulent electromagnetic fields. The typical energy of the emitted
photons is a fraction of the fundamental Compton energy $ \epsilon \sim f \hbar
c/r_e $ with $f \sim 10^{-3}$ plus additional boosting due to the bulk motion
of the medium. The emission properties are similar to synchrotron radiation,
with a typical cooling time $\sim 10^{-4}$ sec. During the wave break, the
plasma is also bulk accelerated in the outward radial direction and at larger
radii can produce afterglows due to the interactions with external medium. The
near equipartition fields required by afterglow models maybe due to magnetic
field regeneration in the outflowing plasma (similarly to the field generation
by LAEMW of laser-plasma interactions) and mixing with the upstream plasma.

study this problem for axisymmetric models of galaxies, with or without
rotation. The numerical simulations are based on the `Perturbation Particles'
method, and use GRAPEs to compute the force due to the cusp. We study how the
density cusp is affected by the initial flattening of the model, as well as the
role played by initial rotation. The logarithmic slope of the density cusp is
found to be very much insensitive to flattening; as a consequence, we deduce
that tangential velocity anisotropy -which supports the flattening- is also of
little influence on the final cusp. We investigate via two different kinds of
rotating models the efficiency with which a rotation velocity component builds
within the cusp. A cusp in rotation develops only for models where a net
rotation component is initially present at high energy levels. The eventual
observation of a central rotational velocity peak in E galaxies has therefore
some implications for the galaxy dynamical history.

The dependence of open and closed charm yields in Pb+Pb collisions on the
number of participating nucleons (N) indicates non thermal charm production and
J/Psi dissociation, stronger than the absorption seen in any other elementary
hadron. The J/Psi in central Pb+Pb collisions could originate dominantly from c
cbar pair coalescence out of a hadronizing quark and gluon environment.
Furthermore, the J/Psi appears to be suppressed in S+U collisions at sqrt(s)=19
GeV, as opposed to current interpretations. A significant change in the
(J/Psi)/D Dbar ratio as well as in the number density of kaons is observed
above energy density approx. 1 GeV/fm^3, suggesting a change of phase at this
energy density, and underlining the importance of direct open charm

so that the branching fractions depend only on the charged Higgs mass and

which gives the dominant contribution in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge. We have
analyzed in detail the region of the (M_{H^+}, tan(beta)) plane to be probed by
searches for B_s -> mu+ mu- in Run II of the Tevatron. Since the branching
fraction increases like tan^4(beta), this decay mode is complementary to b -> s
gamma and efficiently probes the large tan(beta) region. For tan(beta)=60, an
integrated luminosity of 20 fb^{-1} in an extended Run II will probe charged

recalculated the helicity amplitudes for this process, using contour

results are closest to those of the most recent previous computation, differing
significantly for just one of the three independent helicity amplitudes, and
only for backward scattering angles. We present results for the unpolarized
cross section, and for three different polarization asymmetries. We compare the
