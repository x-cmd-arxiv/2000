  ISOCAM 15$\mu m$ Surveys","25 pages, 7 EPS figures. Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/309401",,"astro-ph",,"  A local luminosity function at 15$\mu m$ is derived using the bivariate
(15$\mu m$ vs. 60$\mu m$ luminosity) method, based on the newly published
ISOCAM LW3-band (15$\mu m$) survey of the very deep IRAS 60$\mu m$ sample in
the north ecliptic pole region (NEPR). New IRAS 60$\mu m$ fluxes are obtained
using the SCANPI/SUPERSCANPI software at the new ISOCAM positions of the
sources in the sample. It is found to be in excellent agreement with the 15$\mu
m$ local luminosity function published by Xu et al (1998), which is derived
from the {\it predicted} 15$\mu m$ luminosities of a sample of IRAS 25$\mu m$
selected galaxies. Model predictions of number counts and redshift
distributions based on the local luminosity function and assumptions of its
evolution with the redshift are calculated and compared with the data of ISOCAM
15$\mu m$ surveys. Strong luminosity evolution on the order of $L\propto
(1+z)^{4.5}$ is suggested in these comparisons, while pure density evolution
can be ruled out with high confidence. The sharp peak at about 0.4mJy in the
Euclidean normalized differential counts at 15$\mu m$ can be explained by the
effects of MIR broadband emission features, eliminating the need for any
hypothesis for a 'new population'. It is found that the contribution from the
population represented by ISOCAM 15$\mu m$ sources can account for the entire
IR/submm background, leaving little room for any missing 'new population' which
can be significant energy sources of the IR/submm sky.

The free energy function is written down using a multilayer model in which
c-domain layers of one ferroelectric material alternate with a-domain layers of
a second ferroelectric material. We assume that the interfaces are perfectly
sharp and that the polarization at these boundaries is zero. The
renormalization of the free energy coefficients due to the stresses in the
films and to the depolarizing field was taken into account, as well as the
renormalization of the coefficients of the polarization gradients. The
equilibrium inhomogeneous polarization temperature and its thickness dependence
were determined from the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting
from the minimization of the free energy functional. A thickness induced
ferroelectric phase transition is shown to exist and its transition temperature
and critical layer thickness depend on the domain orientation. The criteria for
''a/c'', ''c/c'' and ''a/a'' domain multilayering are calculated and expressed
via coefficients of the free energy density and the layer thickness.
  The calculated multilayer susceptibility diverges at the transition
temperature of the thickness induced ferroelectric phase. This divergence is
shown to be the origin of the giant dielectric response observed in some
multilayers. The theory gives an excellent fit to the temperature dependence of
the giant susceptibility observed recently in multilayers of
PbTiO$_{3}$-Pb$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$ ($x=0.28$).

SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ are discussed. The spin-gap $\Delta$ of the
three-dimensional model is independent of the inter-layer couplings when they
are small. Therefore at low temperatures ($T < \Delta$) thermodynamic
properties are described well by the two-dimensional model. On the other hand
at high temperatures the mean-field type scaling ansatz is useful to discuss
the magnetic susceptibility for week inter-layer couplings.
  From fit of the magnetic susceptibility, the estimated coupling constants are
J = 85 K for the nearest-neighbor couplings, $J^{'} = 54$ K for the
next-nearest-neighbor couplings, and $J^{''} = 8$ K for the inter-layer
couplings. These parameters are consistent with the temperature dependence of

(DFSs) is examined with particular emphasis on using only physically relevant
interactions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
decoherence-free (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is derived here
for the first time. A stabilizer formalism for DFSs is then developed which
allows for the explicit understanding of these in their dual role as quantum
error correcting codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians whose
induced evolution always preserves a DFS are derived within this stabilizer
formalism. Two possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising from
permutation symmetries of the system-bath coupling are examined within this
framework. It is shown that in both cases universal quantum computation which
always preserves the DFS (*natural fault-tolerant computation*) can be
performed using only two-body interactions. This is in marked contrast to
standard error correcting codes, where all known constructions using one or
two-body interactions must leave the codespace during the on-time of the
fault-tolerant gates. A further consequence of our universality construction is
that a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform universal quantum
computation on an encoded space whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity.
The exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in many quantum systems,
is thus *asymptotically universal*.
