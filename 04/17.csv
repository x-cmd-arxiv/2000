sensor with visual and infrared focal plane arrays to search for NEAs with
orbits largely interior to the Earth's orbit. Such a space-based system could
detect approximately 97% of the Atens and 64% of the, as yet hypothetical,
objects with orbits entirely Interior to Earth's Orbit with diameters greater
than 1 km in a five-year mission and obtain orbits, albedos and diameters for
all of them. These are the results of a feasibility study; optimizing the
concept presented would result in greater levels of completion. The cost of
such a space-based system is estimated to be within a factor of two of the cost
of a ground-based system capable of about 21st magnitude, which would provide
only orbits and absolute magnitudes and require decades to reach these
completeness levels. In addition to obtaining albedos and diameters for the
asteroids discovered in the space-based survey, a space-based system would
obtain the same information on virtually all known NEOs of interest. A combined
space-based and ground-based survey would be highly synergistic in that each
can concentrate on what it does best and each complements the strengths of the
other. An integrated ground-based and space-based system could accomplish the
Spaceguard goal in less time than the ground-based system alone. In addition,
the result would be a catalog containing well-determined orbits, diameters, and
albedos for the majority of NEAs with diameters greater than 500 m.

also examine the gas surface density criterion for massive star formation in
NGC 925, and find that its behavior is more consistent with that for irregular
galaxies, than with late-type spirals. In particular, star formation persists
beyond the radius at which the gas surface density falls below the predicted
critical value for star formation for late-type spirals. Such properties are
characteristic of Magellanic spirals, but are present at a less dramatic level

Flux decay shows a very uncommon variation relative to other well observed
GRBs. Overall, there is a steepening of the optical and near-infrared flux
decay caused by a geometric and sideways expanding jet. This is superimposed by
a short term variability especially during early time (Delta t < 8 days). The
cause of variability is not well understood, though it has occurred
simultaneously with similar amplitude in all the filters. We derive the early
and late time flux decay constants using jet model. The late time flux decay is
the steepest amongst the GRB OTs observed so far with alpha ~ 3. Steepening in
the flux decay seems to have started simultaneously around Delta t ~ 7.6 day in
all passbands. The value of spectral index in the optical-near IR region is ~
-1.0. Redshift determination with z=2.0335 indicates cosmological origin of the
GRB having a luminosity distance of 16.6 Gpc. Thus it becomes the second
farthest amongst the GRBs with known distances. An indirect estimate of the
fluence > 20 keV indicates, if isotropic,> =10^53 ergs of release of energy.
The enormous amount of released energy will be reduced, if the radiation is
beamed which is the case for this event. Using a jet break time of 7.6 days, we
infer a jet opening angle of ~ 0.15 radian. This means the energy released is
reduced by a factor of ~ 90 relative to the isotropic value.

digitized galaxy catalogue, covering an area of ~5200 sq deg, around the South
Galactic Pole. It is complete up to m ~14.5 in b_j for the brightest galaxy of
the group.
  The spectral analysis of the SCG galaxies confirms the results previously
obtained for a smaller sample of Hickson's compact groups (HCG). We confirm the
luminosity-activity and morphology-activity relations, as well as the
predominance of AGNs (41% of SCGs galaxies). We verified also that the number
of early-type non-emission-line galaxies increases with the number of members
in the group.
  The SCGs contain more star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and less non-emission-line
galaxies than HCGs, which suggests that they probe a wider range of physical
properties. The SFGs are composed in majority of HII Nucleus Galaxies, which
have less intense star formation than starburst galaxies. The star formation
activity in SCGs is, consequently, remarkably low. The SFGs show also evidence
for nuclear activity. If these results are further confirmed, 70% of the
galaxies in SCGs would then have an active nucleus, making these systems
remarkably rich in AGNs. Curiously, however, this characteristic of CGs
generally excludes Seyfert 1 galaxies.(Abridged)

which allow for an early emergence of the accretion luminosity. Such cases may
provide a direct observational identification of the black hole formed in the
aftermath of the explosion. Our approach combines analytic estimates and fully
relativistic, radiation-hydrodynamic numerical computations. We employ a
numerical hydrodynamical scaling technique to accommodate the diverse range of
dynamical time scales in a single simulation. We find that while in typical
Type II supernovae heating by radioactive decays dominates the late-time light
curve, low-energy explosions of more massive stars should provide an important
exception where the accretion luminosity will emerge while it is still
relatively large. Our main focus is on the only current candidate for such an
observation, the very unusual SN1997D. Due to the low energy of the explosion
and the very small ($2\times10^{-3} M_\sun$) inferred mass of Co56 in the
ejected envelope, we find that accretion should become the dominant source of
its luminosity during the year 2000. The total luminosity at emergence is
expected to lie in the range $0.5-3\times10^{36} $ ergs/s, potentially
detectable with HST. We also discuss the more favorable case of explosions

Reduced SLD resolution (RSLD), is introduced. In essence, an RSLD derivation is
an SLD derivation such that redundancy elimination from resolvents is performed
after each rewriting step. It is intuitive that redundancy elimination may have
positive effects on derivation process. However, undesiderable effects are also
possible. In particular, as shown in this paper, program termination as well as
completeness of loop checking mechanisms via a given selection rule may be
lost. The study of such effects has led us to an analysis of selection rule
basic concepts, so that we have found convenient to move the attention from
rules of atom selection to rules of atom scheduling. A priority mechanism for
atom scheduling is built, where a priority is assigned to each atom in a
resolvent, and primary importance is given to the event of arrival of new atoms
from the body of the applied clause at rewriting time. This new computational
model proves able to address the study of redundancy elimination effects,
giving at the same time interesting insights into general properties of
selection rules. As a matter of fact, a class of scheduling rules, namely the
specialisation independent ones, is defined in the paper by using not trivial
semantic arguments. As a quite surprising result, specialisation independent
scheduling rules turn out to coincide with a class of rules which have an
immediate structural characterisation (named stack-queue rules). Then we prove
that such scheduling rules are tolerant to redundancy elimination, in the sense
that neither program termination nor completeness of equality loop check is
lost passing from SLD to RSLD.

that we can construct the operator $D$ explicitly for any value of $k$. We
first show that the instanton-related index of all these operators is
identical. We then illustrate in detail a generalization of Neuberger's overlap
Dirac operator to the case $k=1$. On the basis of explicit construction, it is
shown that the chiral symmetry breaking term becomes more irrelevent for larger

large enough lattice is required to accomodate a Dirac operator with a large

the gluon-ghost vertex function offers a convenient possibility to define a
nonperturbative running coupling. The infrared fixed point obtained from this
coupling which determines the 2-point interactions of color-octet quark
currents implies the existence of unphysical massless states which are
necessary to escape the cluster decomposition of colored clusters. The gluon
and ghost propagators, and the nonperturbative running coupling, are compared
to recent lattice simulations. A significant deviation of the running coupling
from the infrared behavior extracted in simulations of 3-point functions is
attributed to an inconsistency of asymmetric subtraction schemes due to a

Gamma(k,T) = lambda T/(2 pi N). For wavectors k<< k_{us} the damping rate is

Analogously, for homogeneous fluctuations in the ultracritical region

complex matrix elements ($\beta = 2$), which is already known to be universal.
Our proof is based on a novel asymptotic property of the skew-orthogonal

half its asymptotic value in the region of the bulk of the zeros. This result
solves the puzzle that microscopic universality persists in spite of
contributions to the microscopic correlators from the region near the largest

classifying different evolutionary systems. Ecolab, whilst not an artificial
life system, is a model of an evolving ecology that has advantages of
mathematical tractability and computational simplicity. The Bedau statistics
are well defined for Ecolab, and this paper reports statistics measured for
typical Ecolab runs, as a function of mutation rate. The behaviour ranges from
class 1 (when mutation is switched off), through class 3 at intermediate
mutation rates (corresponding to scale free dynamics) to class 2 at high
mutation rates. The class 3/class 2 transition corresponds to an error
threshold. Class 4 behaviour, which is typified by the Biosphere, is
characterised by unbounded growth in diversity. It turns out that Ecolab is
governed by an inverse relationship between diversity and connectivity, which
also seems likely of the Biosphere. In Ecolab, the mutation operator is
conservative with respect to connectivity, which explains the boundedness of
diversity. The only way to get class 4 behaviour in Ecolab is to develop an
evolutionary dynamics that reduces connectivity of time.
