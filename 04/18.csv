without us being able to realise it. We assume that a network of domain walls
permeates the universe dividing it in domains with slightly different vacuum
energy densities. We require that the energy scale of the phase transition
which produced the domain walls is sufficiently low so that the walls have a
negligible effect on structure formation. Nevertheless, the different vacuum
densities of different domains will lead to different values of the
cosmological parameters $\Omega_\Lambda^0$, $\Omega_m^0$ and $h$, in each patch
thus affecting the growth of cosmological perturbations at recent times. Hence,
if our local patch of the universe (with uniform vacuum density) is big enough
-- which is likely to happen given that we should have on average about one
domain per horizon volume -- we might not notice these large-scale
inhomogeneities. This happens because in order to see a patch with a different
vacuum density one may have to look back at a time when the universe was still
very homogeneous.

using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We find that the spin-up
falls off only slowly with distance from the black hole because the increased
tidal coupling in slower collisions at larger distances compensates for the
decrease in the stellar density. We apply our results to the stars near the

terms of the Klein-Gordon equation, which is solved analytically as an initial
value problem for transverse (kink) waves. We compute the wave energy flux in
upward propagating transverse waves. In general we find that the injection of
energy into the chromosphere occurs in short-duration pulses, which would lead
to a time variability in chromospheric emission that is incompatible with
observations. Therefore, we consider the effects of turbulent convective flows
on flux tubes in intergranular lanes. The turbulent flows are simulated by
adding high-frequency motions (periods 5-50 s) with an amplitude of 1 km
s^{-1}. The latter are simulated by adding random velocity fluctuations to the
observationally determined velocities. In this case we find that the energy

These models take into account, for the first time, the detailed systematic
variation of horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with age and metallicity. Our
models show that the H$\beta$ index is significantly affected by the presence
of blue HB stars. Because of the contribution from blue HB stars, the H$\beta$
does not monotonically decrease as metallicity increases at a given age.
Instead, it reaches a maximum strength when the distribution of HB stars is
centered around 9500 K, the temperature where the H$\beta$ index becomes
strongest. Our models indicate that the strength of the H$\beta$ index
increases as much as 0.75 {\AA} due to the presence of blue HB stars.
  The comparison of the recent Keck observations of the globular cluster system
in the Milky Way Galaxy with those in giant elliptical galaxies, NGC 1399 and

models suggest that this systematic difference is understood if the globular
cluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are several billion years older,
in the mean, than the Galactic counterpart. Further observations of globular
cluster systems in the external galaxies from the large ground-based telescopes

particle numbers larger than a few 10^7, even on the largest parallel systems.

re-considered the grouping strategy as described in Barnes (1990) (hereafter
B90) and applied it with some modifications to our WDSH-PT (Work and Data
SHaring - Parallel Tree) code. In the first part of this paper we will give a

describe the modification to the Barnes grouping strategy we have devised to
improve the performance of the WDSH-PT code. We will use the property that
nearby particles have similar interaction list. This idea has been checked in
B90, where an interaction list is builded which applies everywhere within a
cell C_{group} containing a little number of particles N_{crit}. B90 reuses
this interaction list for each particle $ p \in C_{group}$ in the cell in turn.
We will assume each particle p to have the same interaction list.
  Thus it has been possible to reduce the CPU time increasing the performances.
This leads us to run simulations with a large number of particles (N ~

structure (EMBH) is analyzed for selected values of the baryonic mass at
selected distances well outside the dyadosphere of an EMBH. The dyadosphere,
the region in which a super critical field exists for the creation of
electron-positron pairs, is here considered in the special case of a
Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. The interaction of the PEM pulse with the baryonic
matter is described using a simplified model of a slab of constant thickness in
the laboratory frame (constant-thickness approximation) as well as performing
the integration of the general relativistic hydrodynamical equations. The
validation of the constant-thickness approximation, already presented in a
previous paper Ruffini, et al.(1999) for a PEM pulse in vacuum, is here
generalized to the presence of baryonic matter. It is found that for a baryonic
shell of mass-energy less than 1% of the total energy of the dyadosphere, the
constant-thickness approximation is in excellent agreement with full general
relativistic computations. The approximation breaks down for larger values of
the baryonic shell mass, however such cases are of less interest for observed
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). On the basis of numerical computations of the slab
model for PEM pulses, we describe (i) the properties of relativistic evolution
of a PEM pulse colliding with a baryonic shell; (ii) the details of the
expected emission energy and observed temperature of the associated GRBs for a
given value of the EMBH mass; 10^3 solar masses, and for baryonic mass-energies

localized spin-dependent Wannier functions belonging to a double-valued
representation of the space group of Nb. The special symmetry of this
""superconducting band"" can be interpreted within a nonadiabatic extension of
the Heisenberg model of magnetism. While the original Heisenberg model assumes
that there is exactly one electron at each atom, the nonadiabatic model
postulates that the Coulomb repulsion energy in narrow, partly filled energy
bands is minimum when the balance between the bandlike and atomiclike behavior
is shifted as far as possible towards the atomiclike behavior. Within this
nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the superconducting band form
Cooper pairs at zero temperature. Just as in the BCS theory of superconduc-
tivity, this formation of Cooper pairs is mediated by phonons. However, there
is an important difference: within the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the
electrons in a narrow superconducting band are constrained to form Cooper pairs
because the conservation of spin angular momentum would be violated in any
normal conducting state. There is great evidence that these constraining forces
are responsible for superconducting eigenstates. That means that an attractive
electron-electron interaction alone is not able to produce stable Cooper pairs.
In addition, the constraining forces established within the nonadiabatic
Heisenberg model must exist in a superconductor.

sufficient for computing n-point functions of CFT operators coupled to the
massless (sugra) sector. The action obtained from the linear ansatz, of the
type $\phi(x,y)=\phi_I(x)Y^I(y)$ gives only part of the gauged sugra. This

  Stereoregular Polymers","29 pages, tables, LaTeX, corrected list of authors",,,,"math.NA",,"  Quasi-onedimensional stereoregular polymers as for example polyacetylene are
currently of considerable interest. There are basically two different
approaches for doing electronic structure calculations: One method is
essentially based on concepts of solid state theory. The other method is
essentially a quantum chemical method since it approximates the polymer by
oligomers consisting of a finite number of monomer units. In this way, the
highly developed technology of quantum chemical molecular programs can be used.
Unfortunately, oligomers of finite size are not necessarily able to model those
features of a polymer which crucially depend of its in principle infinite
extension. In such a case extrapolation techniques can be extremely helpful.
For example, one can perform electronic structure calculations for a sequence
of oligomers with an increasing number of monomer units. In the next step, one
then can try to determine the limit of this sequence for an oligomer of
infinite length with the help of suitable extrapolation methods. Several
different extrapolation methods are discussed which are able to accomplish an
extrapolation of energies and properties of oligomers to the infinite chain
limit. Calculations for the ground state energy of polyacetylene are presented
which demonstrate the practical usefulness of extrapolation methods.

limits the numerical accuracy of the calculated rate given by the squared
