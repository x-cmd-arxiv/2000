can lead to a determination of the Hubble constant ($H_o$), but only if the
lensing mass distribution is well understood. The inability to sufficiently
constrain galaxy mass models results in large uncertainties on the derived
$H_o$, and severely hampers the cosmological application of this otherwise
elegant method. At the same time, lensing must compete with new techniques that
have the potential to measure the Hubble constant to within a few percent by
the middle of the decade. In this letter we re-evaluate the role of strong
gravitational lensing in the age of precision cosmology, and present a series
of Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate the effect of the galaxy mass
distribution on Hubble constant determination. Though most gravitational lens
systems are unlikely to contribute significantly to precision studies of the
cosmological distance scale, the strong dependence of predicted time delays on
the galaxy mass profile suggests that the most useful and interesting results
may be obtained by running the traditional lensing problem in reverse --
namely, combining measured time delays with a well-constrained value of $H_o$
to study galaxy mass distributions.

the formation of the system in the context of the standard evolutionary
scenario for Be/X-ray binaries with consideration of the possibility that the
birth of the neutron star was accompanied by a kick of the type often inferred
from the velocity distribution of isolated radio pulsars. The orbital
eccentricity just after the supernova explosion was almost certainly virtually
the same as at present, because the Be star is much smaller than the orbital
separation. We find that the system most likely formed from a pair of massive
progenitor stars, and probably involved a quasi-stable and nearly conservative
transfer of mass from the primary to the secondary. We find that the He star
remnant of the primary most likely had a mass less than 6 solar masses after
mass transfer. Finally, we speculate that there may be a substantial population
of neutron stars formed with little or no kick.

significantly different from those of non-Seyfert galaxies. In the context of
the interaction model of the formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), it has
been proposed that AGN form via ""minor mergers"" of large disk galaxies with
smaller companions. We test this hypothesis by comparing the nuclear spectra of
105 bright nearby galaxies with measurements of their R or r band morphological
asymmetries at three successive radii. We find no significant differences in
these asymmetries between the 13 Seyfert galaxies in the sample and galaxies
having other nuclear spectral types (absorption, H II-region like, LINER), nor
is there strong qualitative evidence that such mergers have occured among any
of the Seyferts or LINERs. Thus either any minor mergers began > 1 Gyr ago and
are essentially complete, or they did not occur at all, and AGN form
independently of any type of interaction. Support for the latter interpretation
is provided by the growing evidence that supermassive black holes exist in the
cores of most elliptical and early-type spiral galaxies, which in turn suggests
that nuclear activity represents a normal phase in the evolution of the bulges
of massive galaxies. Galaxy mergers may increase the luminosity of Seyfert
nuclei to the level of QSOs, which could explain why the latter objects appear
to be found in rich environments and in interacting systems.

redshift distribution of faint galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), paying
a special attention to the selection effects including the cosmological dimming
of surface brightness of galaxies. We find a considerably different result from
previous studies ignoring the selection effects, and these effects should
therefore be taken into account in the analysis. We find that the model of pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) of galaxies in the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe
predicts much smaller counts than those observed at faint magnitude limits by a
factor of more than 10, so that a very strong number evolution of galaxies with
\eta > 3-4 must be invoked to reproduce the I_{814} counts, when parametrized
as \phi^* \propto (1+z)^\eta. However we show that such a strong number
evolution under realistic merging processes of galaxies can not explain the
steep slope of the B_{450} and V_{606} counts, and it is seriously inconsistent
with their photometric redshift distribution. We find that these difficulties
still persist in an open universe with \Omega_0 > 0.2, but are resolved only
when we invoke a $\Lambda$-dominated flat universe, after examining various
systematic uncertainties in modeling the formation and evolution of galaxies.
The present analysis revitalizes the practice of using faint number counts as
an important cosmological test, giving one of the arguments against the EdS
universe and suggests acceleration of the cosmic expansion by vacuum energy
density. While a modest number evolution of galaxies with \eta ~ 1 is still
necessary even in a Lambda-dominated universe, a stronger number evolution with
\eta > 1 is rejected from the HDF data, giving a strong constraint on the
merger history of galaxies.

functions for a range of density profiles, rho ~ r^(-3/2+p), with 0 < p < 1, to
allow for the presence of outflows. We find that although the 1 keV emitting
region in these flows can always extend up to 10^6 Schwarzschild radii (R_S),
their surface brightness profiles and visibility functions are strongly
affected by the specific density profile. The advection-dominated solutions
with no outflows (p=0) lead to centrally peaked profiles with characteristic
sizes of only a few tens of R_S. Solutions with strong outflows (p~1) lead to
flat intensity profiles with significantly larger characteristic sizes of up to
10^6 R_S. This implies that low luminosity galactic nuclei, such as M87, may
appear as extended X-ray sources when observed with current X-ray imaging
instruments. We show that X-ray brightness profiles and their associated
visibility functions may be powerful probes for determining the relevant mode
of accretion and, in turn, the properties of hot accretion flows. We discuss

hence ambient densities and pulsar velocities). However, no emission clearly
corresponding to a PWN was discovered. Based on these non-detections we argue
that the young and energetic pulsars in our sample have winds typical of young
pulsars, but produce unobservable PWN because they reside in low density (n
approx 0.003 cm^-3) regions of the ISM. However, non-detections of PWN around
older and less energetic pulsars can only be explained if the radio luminosity
of their winds is less than 1e-5 of their spin-down luminosity, implying an
efficiency at least an order of magnitude smaller than that seen for young
pulsars.

variations of the mass loss rate from the secondary. The mass transfer
variation has been derived from 20 years of visual monitoring and from X-ray
observations covering various accretion states of the discless cataclysmic
variable AM Herculis. We find that the outburst behaviour of a fictitious dwarf
nova with the same system parameters as AM Her is strongly influenced by these
variations of the mass loss rate. Depending on the mass loss rate, the disc
produces either long outbursts, a cycle of one long outburst followed by two
short outbursts, or only short outbursts. The course of the transfer rate
dominates the shape of the outbursts because the mass accreted during an
outburst cycle roughly equals the mass transferred from the secondary over the
outburst interval. Only for less than 10% of the simulated time, when the mass
transfer rate is nearly constant, the disc is in a quasi-stationary state
during which it periodically repeats the same cycle of outbursts. Consequently,
assuming that the secondary stars in non-magnetic CV's do not differ from those
in magnetic ones, our simulation indicates that probably all dwarf novae are
rarely in a stationary state and are constantly adjusting to the prevailing
value of the mass transfer rate from the secondary.

electrons was proposed. This mechanism is connected with the existence of a
narrow, roughly half-filled ""superconducting energy band"" of given symmetry.
The special symmetry of the superconducting band was interpreted within a
nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism. Within this
nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the superconducting band are
constrained to form Cooper pairs at zero temperature because in any normal
conducting state the conservation of crystal-spin angular momentum would be
violated. Except for this participation of the angular momentum, the pair
formation is mediated in the familiar way by phonons. Superconducting bands can
be identified even within a free-electron band structure. Therefore, in this
paper the band structures of the bcc and hcp solid solution alloys composed of
transition elements are approximated by appropriate free-electron band
structures with s-d symmetry. From the free-electron bands, the number n of
valence electrons per atom related to the maxima of the superconducting
transition temperature Tc in these solid solutions is calculated within the
nonadiabatic Heisenberg model. The observed two maxima of Tc are reproduced
without any adjustable parameter at valence numbers n approximately equal to
4.9 and 6.5 in bcc and 4.7 and 6.7 in hcp solid solutions. This result is in
good aggreement with the measured values of 4.7 and 6.4 of Hulm and Blaugher.
The upper maximum is predicted not to exist in bcc transition elements but to
occur in several ordered structures of bcc solid solution alloys.

kind of periodic dielectric and causes band gaps to occur in the spectrum of
light propagating through it. We examine the question whether these band gaps
can modify the spontaneous emission rate of atoms excited from the BEC, and
whether they can lead to a self-stabilization of the BEC against spontaneous
emission. We find that self-stabilization is not possible for BECs with a
density in the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the corresponding
non-Markovian behavior produces significant effects in the decay of excited
atoms even for a homogeneous BEC interacting with a weak laser beam. These
effects are caused by the occurrence of an avoided crossing in the photon (or
rather polariton) spectrum. We also predict a new channel for spontaneous decay
which arises from an interference between periodically excited atoms and
periodic photon modes. This new channel should also occur in ordinary periodic
dielectrics.

$\nu(E)$ at energies, E, close to the Fermi level. We derive a system of
self-consistent equations for the correlators of local densities of occupied

temperature, T, is high enough, so that the Coulomb gap is shallow, the
perturbative solution of the system yields analytical expressions for the
interaction-induced correction $\delta\nu(E)$ and the level-level correlator.
We show that even with short-range interactions, $\delta\nu (E)$ exhibits a
singular energy dependence at T=0. We also demonstrate that at high T this
energy dependence is a universal function of the the ratio $E/T$. Regarding the
level correlations, we trace how the correlator falls off as a function of
spatial and energy separation between the levels. We also trace how the
correlations vanish with increasing T. Our most noticeable observation is that
for two close energies the correlator changes sign from positive (attraction)
at small distances to negative (repulsion) at large distances.

is from this perspective that they have been applied to various problems in
order to achieve significant performance gains. There are many applications for
which this compute intensive approach is only a partial solution. CAD, virtual
reality, simulation, document management and analysis all require timely access
to large amounts of data. This thesis investigates the use of the object store
paradigm to harness the large distributed memories found on multicomputers. The
design, implementation, and evaluation of a distributed object server on the
Fujitsu AP1000 is described. The performance of the distributed object server
under example applications, mainly physical simulation problems, is used to
evaluate solutions to the problems of client space recovery, object migration,
and coherence maintenance.
  The distributed object server follows the client-server model, allows object
replication, and uses binary semaphores as a concurrency control measure.
Instrumentation of the server under these applications supports several
conclusions: client space recovery should be dynamically controlled by the
application, predictively prefetching object replicas yields benefits in
restricted circumstances, object migration by storage unit (segment) is not
generally suitable where there are many objects per storage unit, and binary
semaphores are an expensive concurrency control measure in this environment.

quintessence axion). If this axion couples to the electroweak gauge fields, its
potential may be generated by the electroweak instanton effects. We calculate
the axion potential assuming the supersymmetric standard model and obtain a
surprising result that the induced energy density of the quintessence axion
field is very close to the value suggested from the observations.

of the coupled piNNN-NNN problem. The approximation scheme is based on the
physical assumption that, at low energies, the 2N-subsystem dynamics in the
elastic channel is conveniently described by the usual 2N-potential approach,
while the explicit pion dynamics describes small, correction-type effects.
Using the standard separable-expansion method, we obtain a dynamical equation
of the Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) type. This is an important result, because
the computational techniques used for solving the normal AGS equation can also
be used to describe the pion dynamics in the 3N system once the matrix
dimension is increased by one component. We have also shown that this
approximation scheme treats the conventional 3N problem once the pion degrees
of freedom are projected out. Then the 3N system is described with an extended
AGS-type equation where the spin-off of the pion dynamics (beyond the 2N
potential) is taken into account in additional contributions to the driving
term. These new terms are shown to reproduce the diagrams leading to modern
3N-force models. We also recover two sets of irreducible diagrams that are
commonly neglected in 3N-force discussions, and conclude that these sets should
be further investigated, because a claimed cancellation is questionable.

contribution is fixed by the underlying 2N interaction, so in principle there
are no free parameters to adjust. The 2N amplitude however enters in the 3NF

phase-shift analysis. We conclude that this new 3N-force contribution provides
a mechanism which implies that the presence of the third nucleon modifies the

repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) is a long known, but still unexplained
phenomenon. This effect plays a key role in DNA studies because it is unique in
the amount and the variety of the available experimental information and,
therefore, is likely to serve as a gate to the unknown general mechanisms of
recognition and regulation of genome sequences. We report the results of
molecular dynamics simulations of a 25-mer B-DNA fragment with a sequence
including three A-tract phased with the helical screw. It represents the first
model system where properly directed static curvature emerges spontaneously in
conditions excluding any initial bias except the base pair sequence. The effect
has been reproduced in three independent MD trajectories of 10-20 ns with
important qualitative details suggesting that the final bent state is a strong
attractor of trajectories form a broad domain of the conformational space. The
ensemble of curved conformations, however, reveals significant microscopic
heterogeneity in contradiction to all existing theoretical models of bending.
Analysis of these unexpected observations leads to a new, significantly
different hypothesis of the possible mechanism of intrinsic bends in the double

alternative interpretation of the magic numbers for the case of oxides is
proposed, which involves an explicit consideration of isomer structures

properties with size is slower for calcium oxide. Nevertheless, the structures
of the doubly charged clusters are rather similar for the two materials. On the

up to 200mW output after a single-mode optical fiber at 780nm wavelength. The
system is based on a tapered semiconductor gain element, which amplifies the
output of a narrow-linewidth diode laser. Gain and saturation are discussed as
a function of operating temperature and injection current. The spectral
properties of the amplifier are investigated with a grating spectrometer.
Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) causes a spectral background with a width
of 4nm FWHM. The ASE background was suppressed to below our detection limit by
a proper choice of operating current and temperature, and by sending the light
through a single-mode optical fiber. The final ASE spectral density was less
than 0.1nW/MHz, i.e. less than 0.2 % of the optical power. Related to an
optical transition linewidth of $\Gamma/2\pi=6$ MHz for rubidium, this gives a
background suppression of better than -82dB. An indication of the beam quality
is provided by the fiber coupling efficiency up to 59 %. The application of the
amplifier system as a laser source for atom optical experiments is discussed.

principles, possibly new ones, are behind the phenomena of biological interest
and at understanding how they work within the entire biological world. In the
present talk we describe an example of such an effort.
  Since the discovery of `superprecipitation' by Szent-Gyorgyi's group in
1940's, it has been a long puzzle how an assemblage of actin filaments with
random orientation can contract in the presence of the two-headed myosin
molecules undergoing actin-activated ATP-hydrolysis reaction. It is widely
accepted that during the contraction the two-headed myosin mediates the
relative sliding of two actin filaments whose polarity directions are not
parallel but rather anti-parallel. But this fact solely does not account for
the shortening. We propose a dynamical model which, upon numerical simulation,
exhibits the shortening of an bundle of the actin filaments which are initially
dirstributed randomly both in space along a line and in polarity direction. In
the course of shortening several clusters of actins appears along the bundle.
The model also shows the sorting of the actin filaments according to their
polarity in the late stage. These findings are in accordance with the recent
experiment by Takiguchi.
