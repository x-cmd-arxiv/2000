analyze the ensemble of first generation cosmic microwave background anisotropy
experiments to deduce constraints over a six--dimensional parameter space
describing Inflation--generated adiabatic, scalar fluctuations. The basic
preferences of simple Inflation scenarios are consistent with the data set:
flat geometries $(\OmT \equiv 1-\Omk \sim 1)$ and a scale--invariant primeval
spectrum ($n\sim 1$) are favored. Models with significant negative curvature
($\OmT < 0.7$) are eliminated, while constraints on postive curvature are less
stringent. Degeneracies among the parameters prevent independent determinations
of the matter density $\OmM$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and the
Hubble constant $\Ho$ remains relatively unconstrained. We also find that the
height of the first Doppler peak relative to the amplitude suggested by data at
larger $l$ indicates a high baryon content ($\Omb h^2$), almost independently
of the other parameters. Besides the overall qualitative advance expected of
the next generation experiments, their improved dipole calibrations will be
particularly useful for constraining the peak height. Our analysis includes a
{\em Goodness--of--Fit} statistic applicable to power estimates and which
indicates that the maximum likelihood model provides an acceptable fit to the

statistics resulting from the formation epoch distribution of dark halos. In
contrast to previous works on the basis of extensive numerical simulations, our
model provides for the first time an analytic expression for the joint
probability function. Specifically we derive the joint probability function of
halo and mass density contrasts from the extended Press-Schechter theory. Since
this function is derived in the framework of the standard gravitational
instability theory assuming the random-Gaussianity of the primordial density
field alone, we expect that the basic features of the nonlinear and stochastic
biasing predicted from our model are fairly generic. As representative
examples, we compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter models
as a function of a redshift and a smoothing length. Our major findings are (1)
the biasing of the variance evolves strongly as redshift while its
scale-dependence is generally weak and a simple linear biasing model provides a
reasonable approximation roughly at $R\simgt 2(1+z)\himpc$, and (2) the
stochasticity exhibits moderate scale-dependence especially on $R\simlt
20\himpc$, but is almost independent of $z$. Comparison with the previous
numerical simulations shows good agreement with the above behavior, indicating
that the nonlinear and stochastic nature of the halo biasing is essentially
understood by taking account of the distribution of the halo mass and the
formation epoch.

influence of winds outflowing from nearby collapsed galaxies that have already
formed stars. This suggests that the formation of nearby galaxies with masses
less than 10^9 solar masses is likely to be suppressed, irrespective of the
details of galaxy formation. An impinging wind may shock heat the gas of a
nearby perturbation to above the virial temperature, thereby mechanically
evaporating the gas, or the baryons may be stripped from the perturbation
entirely if they are accelerated to above the escape velocity. We show that
baryonic stripping is the most effective of these two processes, because
shock-heated clouds that are too large to be stripped are able to radiatively
cool within a sound-crossing time, limiting evaporation. The intergalactic
medium temperatures and star-formation rates required for outflows to have a
significant influence on the formation of low-mass galaxies are consistent with
current observations, but may soon be examined directly via associated
distortions in the cosmic microwave background, and with near-infrared
observations from the Next Generation Space Telescope, which may detect the

of a chaotic quantum dot coupled via point contacts to a normal metal and a

we find that the conductance is consistent with the dot itself behaving as a
superconductor-- it appears as though Andreev reflections are occurring locally
at the interface between the normal lead and the dot. This is contrasted
against the behaviour of an integrable dot, where for a similar strong coupling
to the superconductor, no such effect is seen. The voltage dependence of the
Andreev conductance thus provides an extremely pronounced quantum signature of
the nature of the dot's classical dynamics. For the chaotic dot, we also study
non-monotonic re-entrance effects which occur in both V and B.

processes is connected with the large number of partonic subprocesses included
in the calculation. These are from the quark and gluon content of the initial
hadrons, and from CKM quark mixing. For example, there are 180 subprocesses
which contribute to the $W$+2jets process, and 292 subprocesses in $W$+3jets

  We propose a simple modification of the rules for evaluation of cross
sections and distributions, which avoids multiplication of channels from the
mixture of quark states. The method is based on a unitary rotation of down
quarks, thus, transporting the mixing matrix elements from vertices of Feynman
diagrams to the parton distribution functions (PDF). As a result, one can
calculate cross sections with significantly fewer subprocesses. For the example
mentioned above, with the new rules, one need evaluate only 21 and 33
subprocesses respectively. The matrix elements of the subprocesses are
calculated without quark mixing but with a modified PDF convolution which
depends on the quark mixing angle, and on the topologies of gauge invariant
classes of diagrams. The proposed method has been incorporated into the CompHEP
program and checked with various examples.

  Axial Gauge Quantization of Gauge Fields","17 pages and uses seceq, psfig and ptptex",,,"SMUHEP/00-07","hep-th",,"  It is shown that ghost fields are indispensable in deriving well-defined
antiderivatives in pure space-like axial gauge quantizations of gauge fields.
To avoid inessential complications we confine ourselves to noninteracting
abelian fields and incorporate their quantizations as a continuous deformation
of those in light-cone gauge. We attain this by constructing an axial gauge
formulation in auxiliary coordinates $x^{\mu}= (x^+,x^-,x^1,x^2)$, where
$x^+=x^0{\rm sin}{\theta}+x^3{\rm cos}{\theta}, x^-=x^0{\rm
cos}{\theta}-x^3{\rm sin}{\theta}$ and $x^+$ and $A_-=A^0{\rm cos}
{\theta}+A^3{\rm sin}{\theta}=0$ are taken as the evolution parameter and the
gauge fixing condition, respectively. We introduce $x^-$-independent residual
gauge fields as ghost fields and accomodate them to the Hamiltonian formalism
by applying McCartor and Robertson's method. As a result, we obtain conserved
translational generators $P_{\mu}$, which retain ghost degrees of freedom
integrated over the hyperplane $x^-=$ constant. They enable us to determine
quantization conditions for the ghost fields in such a way that commutation
relations with $P_{\mu}$ give rise to the correct Heisenberg equations. We show
that regularizing singularities arising from the inversion of a hyperbolic
Laplace operator as principal values, enables us to cancel linear divergences
resulting from $({\partial}_-)^{-2}$ so that the Mandelstam- Leibbrandt form of
gauge field propagator can be derived. It is also shown that the pure
space-like axial gauge formulation in ordinary coordinates can be derived in
the limit ${\theta}\to\frac{\pi}{2}-0$ and that the light-cone axial gauge
formulation turns out to be the case of ${\theta}=\frac{\pi}{4}$.

the Lorentz transformations between moving frames as a particular case of

  Motions","withdrawn",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP",,"  This paper calculates several useful statistical properties of the convex
minorant process generated by random walk processes. In particular, we
calculate the statistics of the longest segment in the convex minorant of a
random walk of a given length. In addition, we calculate the probability that
the convex minorant of a random walk of length N is composed of exactly m
segments; we give an exact formula for the expected number of segments in the
convex minorant. We obsevere that some of this analysis can be meaningful for
the case of Brownian motion on finite intervals; we can calculate exact
formulas for the density of the length of the longest segment in the convex
minorant of Brownian motion on finite intervals.

is shown that when the dependence of the scattering amplitude of the ejected

decreased. The developed approach is simpler to implement than the one based on
the color transparency description of the damping of the final state
interaction, and is essentially equivalent to the latter in the case of the
single rescattering term. The $(e,e')$ process on the deuteron is numerically
investigated and it is shown that, at $x=1$, appreciable finite formation time

  Locus of Trypanosome Kinetoplast DNA","9 two-column pages, 9 integrated eps plates, RevTeX/LaTeX",,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM",,"  The macroscopic curvature induced in the double helical B-DNA by regularly
repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) plays an exceptional role in structural
studies of DNA because this effect presents the most well-documented example of
sequence specific conformational modulations. Recently, a new hypothesis of its
physical origin has been put forward, based upon the results of molecular
dynamics simulations of a 25-mer fragment with three A-tracts phased with the
helical screw. Its sequence, however, had never been encountered in
experimental studies, but was constructed empirically so as to maximize the
magnitude of bending in specific computational conditions. Here we report the
results of a similar investigation of another 25-mer B-DNA fragment now with a
natural base pair sequence found in a bent locus of a minicircle DNA. It is
shown that the static curvature of a considerable magnitude and stable
direction towards the minor grooves of A-tracts emerges spontaneously in
conditions excluding any initial bias except the base pair sequence. Comparison
of the bending dynamics of these two DNA fragments reveals both qualitative
similarities and interesting differences. The results suggest that the A-tract
induced bending obtained in simulations reproduces the natural phenomenon and
validates the earlier conclusions concerning its possible mechanism.

that two superposed photon polarizations excite two superposed spin states.
Entanglement of the electron spin state with the spin state of the remaining
hole is prevented by using a single, non-degenerate initial valence band. The
degeneracy of the valence band is lifted by the combination of strain and a
static magnetic field. We give a detailed description of a semiconductor
structure that transfers photon polarization to electron spin coherently, and
allows electron spins to be stored and to be made available for quantum
information processing.
