  Polarization","final version accepted by ApJ; references added, somewhat shortened",,"10.1086/317845",,"astro-ph",,"  Two possible explanations for the low luminosity of the supermassive black
hole at the center of our galaxy are (1) an accretion rate of order the
canonical Bondi value (roughly 10^{-5} solar masses per year), but a very low
radiative efficiency for the accreting gas or (2) an accretion rate much less
than the Bondi rate. Both models can explain the broad-band spectrum of the
Galactic Center. We show that they can be distinguished using the linear
polarization of synchrotron radiation. Accretion at the Bondi rate predicts no
linear polarization at any frequency due to Faraday depolarization. Low
accretion rate models, on the other hand, have much lower gas densities and
magnetic field strengths close to the black hole; polarization may therefore be
observable at high frequencies. If confirmed, a recent detection of linear
polarization from Sgr A$^*$ above 150 GHz argues for an accretion rate of order
10^{-8} solar masses per year, much less than the Bondi rate. This test can be
applied to other low-luminosity galactic nuclei.

observations. Our results suggest that carbon and nitrogen originate from
separate production sites and are decoupled from one another. Massive stars
(M>8M_sun) dominate the production of carbon, while intermediate-mass stars
between 4 and 8 solar masses, with a characteristic ejection delay time of 250
Myr after their formation, dominate nitrogen production. Carbon production is
positively sensitive to metallicity through mass loss processes in massive
stars and has a pseudo-secondary character. Nitrogen production in intermediate
mass stars is primary at low metallicity, but clearly secondary (and perhaps
tertiary) when 12+log(O/H)>8.3. The observed flat behavior of N/O versus O/H in
metal-poor galaxies is explained by invoking low star formation rates which
flatten the age-metallicity relation and thereby allow N/O to rise to observed
levels at low metallicities. The observed scatter and distribution of data
points for N/O challenge the popular idea that intermittent polluting by oxygen
from massive stars is occurring following star bursts. The effect of inflow of
gas into galactic systems on secondary production of nitrogen from carbon may
introduce some scatter into N/O ratios at high metallicities.

Spectroscopic redshifts, peak fluxes, and high resolution light curves are

these bursts positively correlate with a rigorously-constructed measure V of
the variability of their light curves. We fit a model to these data that
accommodates both intrinsic scatter (statistical variance) and extrinsic
scatter (sample variance). If one excludes GRB 980425 from the fit on the
grounds that its association with SN 1998bw at a redshift of z = 0.0085 is not
secure, the luminosity estimator spans approx. 2.5 orders of magnitude in L,
and the slope of the correlation between L and V is positive with a probability
of 1 - 1.4 x 10^-4 (3.8 sigma). Although GRB 980425 is excluded from this fit,
its L and V values are consistent with the fitted model, which suggests that
GRB 980425 may well be associated with SN 1998bw, and that GRB 980425 and the
cosmological bursts may share a common physical origin. If one includes GRB
980425 in the fit, the luminosity estimator spans approx. 6.3 orders of

interactions of low energy photons or electrons near the surface of the

isothermality in the cluster gas, single-temperature models produce acceptable
fits to 20,000 source photon spectra. The spectral fit temperature T_s is
generally lower than the mass weighted average temperature T_m due to the
influence of soft line emission from cooler gas being accreted as part of the
hierarchical clustering process. In a Chandra-like bandpass of 0.5 to 9.5 keV
we find a nearly uniform fractional bias of (T_m-T_s)/T_s = 20% with occasional
large deviations in smaller clusters. In the more traditional 2.0 to 9.5 keV

evolution of CVs with low-mass donors. We consider sequences with different
mass transfer rates and with a different degree of nuclear evolution of the
donor prior to mass transfer. Systems near the upper edge of the gap ($P \sim 3
- 6$ h) can be reproduced by models with a wide range of mass transfer rates
from $1.5 \times 10^{-9} \msolyr$ to $10^{-8} \msolyr$. Evolutionary sequences
with a small transfer rate and donors that are substantially evolved off the
ZAMS (central hydrogen content $0.05-0.5$) reproduce CVs with late spectral
types above $P \simgr$ 6 h. Systems with the most discrepant (late) spectral
type should have the smallest donor mass at any given $P$. Consistency with the
period gap suggests that the mass transfer rate increases with decreasing donor
mass for evolved sequences above the period gap. In this case, a
single-parameter family of sequences with varying $\xc$ and increasing mass
transfer rate reproduces the full range of observed spectral types. This would
imply that CVs with such evolved secondaries dominate the CV population.

limiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a wide
range in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometric

reconstructing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples of

Exploiting the statistical approach of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, our
iterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis, so that it
provides better agreement with the photometry. We demonstrate the utility of
this approach by applying these improved spectral energy distributions to the
estimation of photometric redshifts for the HDF sample of galaxies. We find
that in a small number of iterations the dispersion in the photometric

expected to be one-dimensional, whereas the magnetic fluctuations observed to

apparent two-dimensionality results from measurements on twinned crystals, and
that similar measurements on substantially detwinned crystals of

independent of the coupling strength between oscillations and the detector, and
is equal to $(\hbar/\epsilon)^2$, where $\epsilon$ is the detector energy

estimation which is optimal in the sense of a minimum average quadratic error.
The Kalman filter has two main restrictions: (i) the dynamical system is
assumed linear and (ii) forecasting errors and observational noises are taken
Gaussian. Here, we offer an important generalization to the case where errors
and noises have heavy tail distributions such as power laws and L\'evy laws.
The main tool needed to solve this ``Kalman-L\'evy'' filter is the
``tail-covariance'' matrix which generalizes the covariance matrix in the case
where it is mathematically ill-defined (i.e. for power law tail exponents $\mu
\leq 2$). We present the general solution and discuss its properties on
pedagogical examples. The standard Kalman-Gaussian filter is recovered for the
case $\mu = 2$. The optimal Kalman-L\'evy filter is found to deviate
substantially fro the standard Kalman-Gaussian filter as $\mu$ deviates from 2.
As $\mu$ decreases, novel observations are assimilated with less and less
weight as a small exponent $\mu$ implies large errors with significant
probabilities. In terms of implementation, the price-to-pay associated with the
presence of heavy tail noise distributions is that the standard linear
formalism valid for the Gaussian case is transformed into a nonlinear matrice
equation for the Kalman-L\'evy filter. Direct numerical experiments in the
univariate case confirms our theoretical predictions.

distortion substantially affects both the AFD and FE mode frequencies. The AFD
mode is found to be softer for rotations around a perpendicular axis (Eg mode)

experimental results. The FE mode, on the other hand, is found to be softer
when polarized perpendicular to the tetragonal axis (Eu mode) than parallel to

evidence. Finally, we present a discussion of the influence of various types of

arrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of a

fluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\cal E^{\infty}$. It is shown that

numbers, with disjoint union and Cartesian product playing the role of addition
and multiplication. We sketch how categorifying the integers leads naturally to
the infinite loop space Omega^infinity S^infinity, and how categorifying the
positive rationals leads naturally to a notion of the `homotopy cardinality' of
a tame space. Then we show how categorifying formal power series leads to
Joyal's `especes des structures', or `structure types'. We also describe a
useful generalization of structure types called `stuff types'. There is an
inner product of stuff types that makes the category of stuff types into a
categorified version of the Hilbert space of the quantized harmonic oscillator.

spaces of V and W, respectively.
  We also introduce the semi-infinite cohomology functor for associative
algebras and define modifications of Hecke algebras acting in semi-infinite
cohomology spaces. We call these algebras semi-infinite Hecke algebras.
  As an example we realize the W-algebra W(g) associated to a complex
semisimple Lie algebra g as a semi-infinite Hecke algebra. Using this
realization we explicitly calculate the algebra W(g) avoiding the bosonization
technique used by Feigin and Frenkel.

bands with the total isospin T=0 in 22Na, 48Cr and 90Rh nuclei is discussed in
the spherical shell model. These bands were selected requiring termination in a
most unfavourable way. The investigated effects coming from pairing
interactions include the change of nuclear wavefunction, quadrupole properties
and state energy. To follow the gradual change of nuclear properties, the
investigation is performed in a perturbative approach by defining the
Hamiltonian with a variable content of the pairing interaction. It is shown
that the pairing does not affect the quadrupole properties, if the energy
distance to other close lying states is large. The calculated pairing energy is
shown to have a similar spin dependence in these three bands. In addition, the
influence of the model space as well as of the residual interaction on the
derived pairing energy is discussed.

transformation is introduced,, the equations of geodetic lines described in
curved space-time can be transformed into the dynamic equations in flat
space-time, that is to say, the Einstein theory of gravitation and other
theories based on the curved space-time can be identically transformed into
flat space-time to describe. As an example, the Schwarzschild solution of the
spherical symmetry gravitational field is transformed into flat space-time to
study. The results show that there exists no any singularity in the all
processes and the whole space-time including at the point r=0. So it seems more
rational to discuss the problems of gravitation in flat space-time.

  clarification of ""dimensional aspects""",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  There is general agreement that the universe began with an ""explosion"" of
matter and energy at a ""singularity"", the ""Big Bang"". This paper analyses the
mechanics of that beginning and two alternative theories related to it: - The
Hubble-Einstein theory that that beginning created space itself, expanding and
carrying the universe's matter and energy with it, and - The Universal Decay
theory that the length, (L), dimensional aspect of all quantities in the
universe is exponentially decaying while the material universe is expanding
outward within passive, static ""space"".
  The Hubble-Einstein theory has long been accepted by consensus.
  The Universal Decay theory first propounded in ""The Origin and Its Meaning""
in 1996 has since been validated by the Pioneer 10 and 11 ""anomalous
acceleration"" as well as by the theory's success in accounting for ""dark
matter"" and ""dark energy"". The same centrally- directed, distance-independent
acceleration of (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^-8 cm/s^2 that is the Pioneer ""anomalous
acceleration"" supplies the ""additional gravitation"" that ""dark matter"" is
sought to supply.
  The mass of the universe is calculated and the its ""Schwarzschild Radius""
evaluated. The velocities and distances of cosmic objects in general are
calculated and plotted from the end of the ""inflation"" to the present. It
develops that there is a theoretical limit on how far back into the past can be
observed regardless of the quality of our instrumentation.

nontrivial twins requires singularity of W. Systems in thermodynamic
