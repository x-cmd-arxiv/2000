bursts cool provides a strong constraint on the radius of the underlying
neutron star. If the change in spin frequency is due to a change in the
thickness of the atmosphere, the radius of the star must exceed $3 G M/c^2$ for
any equation of state and approximately $3.5 G M/c^2$ for most physically
reasonable equations of state. This constraint arises because the direction of
the Coriolis force for radial motion reverses for $R < G / c^2 (M + I / R^2)$.
Furthermore, the marked change in the magnitude of the Coriolis force near
compact stars provides a straightforward explanation for why the frequency of
the quickly rotating bursters shifts by the same amount as the slow rotators;
they are slightly more massive, 1.6M$_\odot$ versus 1.4M$_\odot$. \

light particles in the fireball to baryons. The energy needed to produce the
required relativistic flow in the GRB is consequently reduced, in some cases by
orders of magnitude. This could be relevant to GRB models because a high
neutron-to-proton ratio has been calculated in neutron star-merger fireball
environments. Significant neutron excess also could occur near compact objects
with high neutrino fluxes.

noise, high resolution spectroscopy of Li I (6708 Angstroms) and K I (4044
Angstroms) were obtained toward zeta and o Per. The lithium isotope shift is
approximately the same as its fine structure splitting (0.158 Angstroms),
resulting in a blend of the 7Li and 6Li lines. Use of the K I line as a
velocity template allowed a straightforward determination of the lithium
isotopic ratio.
  Our high resolution observations show remarkably disparate isotope ratios:
7Li/6Li = 1 0.6 +/- 2.9 toward zeta Per and 3.6 +/- 0.6 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 toward
o Per. While the results toward zeta Per are consistent with the meteoritic
value, the ratio toward o Per's clouds suggest recent Galactic cosmic ray
spallation. This is the first clear and unambiguous evidence for an
interstellar 7Li/6Li ratio that differs dramatically from the Solar System
value. The low ratio indicates a higher cosmic ray flux toward o Per than
toward zeta Per. A higher flux of cosmic rays toward o Per was suggested
earlier in a study of OH and HD chemistry (Federman, Weber, & Lambert 1996, ApJ
463, 181).
  The total lithium abundances and the K/Li ratio are useful in placing the
7Li/6Li ratio into context. We obtained total lithium abundances of (12.2 +/-
2.2) x 10^(-10) toward zeta Per and (9.8 +/- 3.5) x 10^(-10) toward o Per. The
columns of K I and Li I yielded K/Li ratios that revealed no discernable trend.
Since a Li isotope ratio ~2 toward o Per suggests newly processed lithium, the
comparable total Li abundances and K/Li ratios are unexpected.

spin-up/down trends in its pulse frequency time series, without any correlation
with the X-luminosity at energies $>$20 keV (Baykal 1997). In the present RXTE
observations the source is found to be in an extended phase of spin-down. We
also find a gradual increase in the X-ray luminosity which is correlated with a
marginal spin-up episode. The marginal correlation between the gradual spin-up
(or decrease in spin-down rate) and increase in X-ray luminosity suggests that
the OAO 1657-415 is observed during a stable accretion episode where the

degenerate fermion kinetic energy and particle interactions. As a result, white

the magnetic coherence effect establishes the ability of INS experiments to
probe the electronic spectrum of the cuprates, in that the effect arises from
the interplay of an incommensurate magnetic response, the form of the
underlying Fermi surface, and the opening of the d-wave gap in the fermionic

solution to these equations yields the free energy and by modifications of the
paths of integration the next-leading eigenvalues and hence the correlation
lengths are obtained. At finite field $h>0$ and sufficiently high temperature
$T$ the next-leading eigenvalue is unique and given by a 1-string solution to
the QTM taking real and negative values thus resulting into exponentially
decaying correlations with antiferromagnetic oscillations. At sufficiently low
temperatures a different behaviour sets in where the next-leading eigenvalues
of QTM are given by a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues resulting into
incommensurate oscillations.
  The above scenario is the result of analytical and numerical investigations
of the QTM establishing a well defined crossover temperature $T_c(h)$ at which
the 1-string eigenvalue to the QTM gets degenerate with the 2-string solution.

to the general case of two degenerate cavity modes with orthogonal
polarization. Analytical calculations of the dressed-state structure and Monte
Carlo wave-function simulations of the system dynamics show that, for a
suitably chosen cavity detuning, it is possible to generate states of photon
multiplets that are maximally entangled in polarization. These states display
nonclassical correlations of the type described by Greenberger, Horne, and
Zeilinger (GHZ). An experimental scheme to realize a GHZ measurement using
coincidence detection of the photons escaping from the cavity is proposed. The
correlations are found to originate in the dynamics of the adiabatic passage

time scale. Beyond entangled field states, it is also possible to generate
entanglement between photons and the atom by using a different atomic
transition and initial Zeeman state.

$n$. This is done by first iteratively determining explicit representations for
the SU(n) coherent states, and then determining parametric representations
useful for applications. For SU(n), the set of coherent states is isomorphic to
a coset space $SU(n)/SU(n-1)$, and thus shows the geometrical structure of the
coset space. These results provide a convenient $(2n - 1)$--dimensional space
for the description of arbitrary SU(n) systems. We further obtain the metric
and measure on the coset space, and show some properties of the SU(n) coherent
states.
