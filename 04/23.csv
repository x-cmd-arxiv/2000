galaxies using cosmological N-body simulations. The N-body simulations are used
to make merging history trees of dark halos. Gas cooling, star formation,
supernova feedback and mergers of galaxies within dark halos are included by
using simple prescriptions taken from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.
In this {\it Letter} we exam the merger-driven bulge formation model and
represent the morphology-density relation of cluster galaxies at z = 0. We find
that this morphological evolution model can explain the distribution of
elliptical galaxies in the clusters well and cannot reproduce the distribution
of S0 galaxies. This result suggests that the elliptical galaxies are mainly
formed by the major mergers, while, in the S0 formation, the processes other
than major mergers play important role.

that the expansion of the universe has recently begun to accelerate.
Acceleration is created by an anti-gravitational repulsive stress, like that
produced by a positive cosmological constant, or universal vacuum energy. It
creates a rather bleak eschatological picture. An ever-expanding universe's
future appears to be increasingly dominated by its constant vacuum energy. A
universe doomed to accelerate forever will produce a state of growing
uniformity and cosmic loneliness. Structures participating in the cosmological
expansion will ultimately leave each others' horizons and
information-processing must eventually die out. Here, we examine whether this
picture is the only interpretation of the observations. We find that in many
well-motivated scenarios the observed spell of vacuum domination is only a
transient phenomenon. Soon after acceleration starts, the vacuum energy's
anti-gravitational properties are reversed, and a matter-dominated decelerating
cosmic expansion resumes. Thus, contrary to general expectations, once an
accelerating universe does not mean always an accelerating universe.

  of DNA","11 pages, 6 figures. To appear in PhysicalReview E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.62.1128",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  Motivated by the experiments on DNA under torsion, we consider the problem of
pulling a polymer out of a potential well by a force applied to one of its
ends. If the force is less than a critical value, then the process is activated
and has an activation energy proportinal to the length of the chain. Above this
critical value, the process is barrierless and will occur spontaneously. We use
the Rouse model for the description of the dynamics of the peeling out and
study the average behaviour of the chain, by replacing the random noise by its
mean. The resultant mean-field equation is a nonlinear diffusion equation and
hence rather difficult to analyze. We use physical arguments to convert this in
to a moving boundary value problem, which can then be solved exactly. The
result is that the time $t_{po}$ required to pull out a polymer of $N$ segments
scales like $N^2$. For models other than the Rouse, we argue that $t_{po}\sim
N^{1+\nu}$

electronic properties of single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) circuits on
insulating substrates. When a voltage is applied to the tip and AFM feedback is
used to position the tip, images formed from the tip-sample tunnel current have
single tube resolution (near 1 nm diameter), more than an order of magnitude
better than simultaneously acquired topographic AFM images. By finding points
where the tip-sample current is zero, it is possible to measure the
electrochemical potential within the circuit, again with nanometer resolution.
Such measurements provide compelling evidence that nanotubes within a bundle
have only weak electronic coupling. Finally the AFM tip is used as a local
electrostatic gate, and the gating action can be correlated with the structure
of the SWNT bundle sample. This technique should be useful for a broad range of
circuits containing SWNTs and other molecules.

between the crumpled phase and the smooth phase has been studied by a finite
size scaling method. From the numerical results, we expect that this model
(coupled to one gauge field) has a higher order phase transition than first
order, which means the possibility to take the continuum limit at the critical
point. Furthermore, we consider a modification of the balls-in-boxes model for
a clear understanding of the relation between the numerical results and the

nuclei. Two derivations of the particle-rotor model are given. One of these is
of a form that lends itself to an expansion of the result in powers of the
ratio of single-particle angular momentum to collective angular momentum, that
is essentual to reach the cranking limit. The derivation also requires a
distinct, angular-momentum violating, step. The structure of the result implies
the possibility of tilted-axis cranking for the axial case and full
three-dimensional cranking for the triaxial one. The final equations remain
number conserving. In an appendix, the Kerman-Klein method is developed in more
detail, and the outlines of several algorithms for obtaining solutions of the

classical thermodynamics. The approach is logically based on the fact that
thermodynamic work is mediated by thermal energy through the tendency for
nonthermal energy to convert spontaneously into thermal energy and for thermal
energy to distribute spontaneously and uniformly within the accessible space.
The fact that free energy is a Second-Law, expendable energy that makes it
possible for thermodynamic work to be done at finite rates is emphasized.
Entropy, as originally defined, is pointed out to be the capacity factor for
thermal energy that is hidden with respect to temperature; it serves to
evaluate the practical quality of thermal energy and to account for changes in
the amounts of latent thermal energies in systems maintained at constant
temperature. A major objective was to clarify the means by which free energy is
transferred and conserved in sequences of biological reactions coupled by
freely diffusible intermediates. In achieving this objective it was found
necessary to distinguish between a 'characteristic free energy' possessed by
all First-Law energies in amounts equivalent to the amounts of the energies
themselves and a 'free energy of concentration' that is intrinsically
mechanical and relatively elusive in that it can appear to be free of First-Law
energy. The findings in this regard serve to clarify the fact that the transfer
of chemical potential energy from one repository to another along sequences of
biological reactions of the above sort occurs through transfer of the First-Law
energy as thermal energy and transfer of the Second-Law energy as free energy
of concentration.
