  ""Energy Densities in the Universe"", Les Arcs, France, January 22-29 2000",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present an analysis of the Gaussianity of the 4-year COBE-DMR data (in
HEALPix pixelisation) based on spherical wavelets. The skewness, kurtosis and
scale-scale correlation spectra are computed from the detail wavelet
coefficients at each scale. The sensitivity of the method to the orientation of
the data is also taken into account. We find a single detection of
non-Gaussianity at the $>99%$ confidence level in one of our statistics. We use
Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of this
detection and find that the probability of obtaining such a detection by chance
for an underlying Gaussian field is as high as 0.69. Therefore, our analysis
does not show evidence of non-Gaussianity in the COBE-DMR data.

450um and 850um. The 850um map shows significant extended emission which is
most probably a remnant of the initial cloud core. At 450um, the component 4A
is seen to have an elongated shape suggestive of a disk. Also we confirm that
in addition to the 4A and 4B system, there exists another component 4C, which
appears to lie out of the plane of the system and of the extended emission.
Deconvolution of the beam reveals a binary companion to IRAS4B. Simple
considerations of binary dynamics suggest that this triple 4A-4BI-4BII system
is unstable and will probably not survive in its current form. Thus IRAS4
provides evidence that systems can evolve from higher to lower multiplicity as
they move towards the main sequence. We construct a map of spectral index from
the two wavelengths, and comment on the implications of this for dust evolution
and temperature differences across the map. There is evidence that in the
region of component 4A the dust has evolved, probably by coagulating into
larger or more complex grains. Furthermore, there is evidence from the spectral
index maps that dust from this object is being entrained in its associated
outflow.

the low probability a planet has of transiting its parent star. One way of
overcoming this difficulty is to search for transits in dense stellar fields,

detected from a monitoring campaign toward the bulge. A campaign lasting 10
nights on a 10 meter telescope (assuming 8 hours of observations per night and
a 5'x5' field of view) would detect about 100 planets with radius $\rp=1.5
\rjup$, or about 30 planets with $\rp=1.0 \rjup$, if the frequency and
distribution of planets in the bulge is similar to that in the solar
neighborhood. Most of these planets will be discovered around stars just below
the turn-off, i.e. slightly evolved G-dwarfs. Campaigns involving 1- or 4-m
class telescopes are unlikely to discover any planets, unless there exists a
substantial population of companions with $\rp > 1.5 \rjup$.

high-redshif t ($z > 1$) galaxies has been claimed to be a relatively robust
process (e.g. Dunlop et al. 1996) due to the fact that, for ages $< 5$Gyr, the
near-ultraviolet light of a stellar population is expected to be dominated by
`well-understood' main-sequence (MS) stars. Recently, however, the reliability
of this process has been called into question by Yi et al (2000), who claim to
have developed models in which the spectrum produced by the main sequence
reddens much more rapidly than in the models of Jimenez et al (2000a), leading
to much younger age estimates for the reddest known high-redshift ellipticals.
In support of their revised age estimates, Yi et al cite the fact that their
models can reproduce the spectrum of the Sun at an age of 5 Gyr, whereas the
solar spectrum is not reproduced by the Jimenez et al models until $\simeq 10$
Gyr. Here we confirm this discrepancy, but point out that this is in fact a
{\it strength} of the Jimenez et al models and indicative of some flaw in the
models of Yi et al (which, in effect, imply that the Sun will turn into a red
giant any minute now). We have also explored the models of Worthey (1994)
(which are known to differ greatly from those of Jimenez et al in the treatment
of post-MS evolution) and find that the main-sequence component of Worthey's
models also cannot reproduce the solar spectrum until an age of 9-10 Gyr. We
conclude that either the models of Yi et al are not as main-sequence dominated
at 4-5 Gyr as claimed, or that the stellar evolutionary timescale in these
models is in error by a factor possibly as high as two. (abridged)

  Since 1996 there is major influx of X-ray and $\gamma$ ray data from binary
stars, one or both of which are compact objects that are difficult to explain
as neutron stars since they contain a mass M in too small a radius R . The
suggestion has been put forward that these are strange quark stars (SS)
explainable in a simple model with chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) for the
quarks and the M, R and other properties like QPOs (quasi periodic
oscillations) in their X-ray power spectrum.
  It would be nice if this astrophysical data could shed some light on
fundamental properties of quarks obeying QCD. One can relate the strong
coupling constant of QCD, $\alpha_s$ to the quark mass through the
Dyson-Schwinger gap equation using the real time formalism of Dolan and Jackiw.
This enables us to obtain the density dependence of $\alpha_s$ from the simple
CSR referred to above. This way fundamental physics, difficult to extract from
other models like for example lattice QCD, can be constrained from present-day
compact star data and may be put back to modelling the dense quark phase of
early universe.

dynamically in QCD if the maximal Abelian gauge is adopted. This result
strongly supports the Abelian dominance in low-energy region of QCD. The mass
generation is shown to occur due to ghost-anti-ghost condensation caused by
attractive quartic ghost interactions within the Abelian projected effective
gauge theory (derived by one of the authors). In fact, the quartic ghost
interaction is indispensable for the renormalizability due to nonlinearity of
the maximal Abelian gauge. The ghost-anti-ghost condensation is associated with
the spontaneous breaking of global SL(2,R) symmetry recently found by Schaden
at least for SU(2) case. Moreover we write down a new extended BRS algebra in
the maximal Abelian gauge which should be compared with that of Nakanishi-Ojima
for the Lorentz gauge. Finally, we argue that the mass generation may be
related to the spontaneous breaking of a supersymmetry $OSp(4|2)$ hidden in the
maximal Abelian gauge.

perturbations of the brane-world model in which our universe is realized as a
boundary of a higher-dimensional spacetime. For the background model in which
the bulk spacetime is $(n+m)$-dimensional and has the spatial symmetry
corresponding to the isometry group of a $n$-dimensional maximally symmetric
space, gauge-invariant equations are derived for perturbations of the bulk
spacetime. Further for the case corresponding to the brane-world model in which
$m=2$ and the brane is a boundary invariant under the spatial symmetry in the
unperturbed background, relations between the gauge-invariant variables
describing the bulk perturbations and those for brane perturbations are derived
from Israel's junction condition under the assumption of $\ZR_2$ symmetry. In
particular, for the case in which the bulk spacetime is a constant-curvature
spacetime, it is shown that the bulk perturbation equations reduce to a single
hyperbolic master equation for a master variable, and that the physical
condition on the gauge-invariant variable describing the intrinsic stress
perturbation of the brane yield a boundary condition for the master equation
through the junction condition. On the basis of this formalism it is pointed
out that it seems to be difficult to suppress brane perturbations corresponding
to massive excitations for a brane motion giving a realistic expanding universe
model.

spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it
also requires specifying which features of $\X$ play a role in the prediction.
We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\X$ that
preserves the maximum information about $\Y$. That is, we squeeze the
information that $\X$ provides about $\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a
limited set of codewords $\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be
seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion
measure $d(x,\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\X$ and $\Y$. This
approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules
$X \to \tX$ and $\tX \to \Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a
convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.
Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing
a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described

integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year
graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in
quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however.
  The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the
standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is,
arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path
integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the
quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter
physics and quantum field theory.
  After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the
subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum
mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We
then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in
multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics,
perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and
instantons via path integrals.
  For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar
setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic)
of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field
theory.
