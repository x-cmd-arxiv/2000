DW UMa in an optical low state, as observed with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The data are well
described by a synthetic white dwarf (WD) spectrum with T_eff = 46,000 +/- 1000
K, log g = 7.60 +/- 0.15, v*sin(i) = 370 +/- 100 km/s and Z/Z_solar = 0.47 +/-
0.15. For this combination of T_eff and log g, WD models predict M_WD = 0.48
+/- 0.06 M_solar and R_WD = (1.27 +/- 0.18) * 10^9 cm. Combining the radius
estimate with the normalization of the spectral fit, we obtain a distance
estimate of d = 830 +/-150 pc.
  During our observations, DW UMa was approximately 3 magnitudes fainter in V
than in the high state. A comparison of our low-state HST spectrum to a
high-state spectrum obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer shows
that the former is much bluer and has a higher continuum level shortward of
1450 A. Since DW UMa is an eclipsing system, this suggests that an optically
thick accretion disk rim blocks our view of the WD primary in the high state.
If self-occulting accretion disks are common among the SW Sex stars, we can
account for (i) the preference for high-inclination systems within the class
and (ii) their V-shaped continuum eclipses. Moreover, even though the emission
lines produced by a self-obscured disk are generally still double-peaked, they
are weaker and narrower than those produced by an unobscured disk. This may
allow a secondary line emission mechanism to dominate and produce the
single-peaked, optical lines that are a distinguishing characteristic of the SW
Sex stars.

ratios that are independent of position. The motions of the two fluids are
coupled by mutual friction, as formulated by Khalatnikov. We show that there
are two general classes of modes for small perturbations: one class in which
the two fluids move together and the other in which there is relative motion
between them. The former are identical to the modes found for a single fluid,
except that the rate of viscous dissipation, when computed in the secular (or
``low Reynolds number'') approximation under the assumption of a constant
kinematic viscosity, is diminished by a factor $f_N$, the fraction of the total
mass in the normal fluid. The relative modes are completely new, and are
studied in detail for a range of values for the phenomenological mutual
friction coefficients, relative densities of the superfluid and normal

are no new secular instabilities connected with the relative motions of the two

dissipation (a consequence of viscosity of the normal matter), they do not emit
gravitational radiation at all.

that the SNe energy input can be important for heating of the entire ICM

uniform and the efficiency of gas heating by SN explosions is close to 100%
(implying that all of the initial kinetic energy of the explosion goes into

Different theories for unified models of particle physics, lead to different
predictions for the statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations, that
can be divided in two classes: gaussian and non-gaussian. Convincing evidence
against or for gaussian initial conditions would rule out many scenarios and
point us towards a physical theory for the origin of structures. The
statistical distribution of cosmological perturbations, as we observe them, can
deviate from the gaussian distribution in several different ways. Even if
perturbations start off gaussian, non-linear gravitational evolution can
introduce non-gaussian features. Additionally, our knowledge of the Universe
comes principally from the study of luminous material such as galaxies, but
these might not be faithful tracers of the underlying mass distribution. The
relationship between fluctuations in the mass and in the galaxies distribution
(bias), is often assumed to be local, but could well be non-linear. Moreover,
galaxy catalogues use the redshift as third spatial coordinate: the resulting
redshift-space map is non-linearly distorted by peculiar velocities. Non-linear
gravitational evolution, biasing, and redshift-space distortion introduce
non-gaussianity, even in an initially gaussian fluctuation field. I will
investigate the statistical tools that allow us, in principle, to disentangle
the above different effects, and the observational datasets we require to do so
in practice.

calculate the electron mediated RKKY interaction between the impurity spins in

We argue that this interaction leads to the formation of a spin glass at low
temperature $T \ll T_c$. It was previously shown that a local complex $\Delta^1
\sim d_{xy}$ order parameter is induced around each impurity spin. We consider
the pair tunneling resulting in the Josephson interaction between different
patches of induced $d_{xy}$ order parameter. Due to the local coupling between
impurity spins and the superconducting order parameter the Josephson coupling
favors a ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. The competition between the
Josephson coupling and the RKKY interaction gives rise to an interesting phase
diagram. At low impurity concentrations we find an unusual supercondcting phase
glass, where the impurity spins $S^z$ and $d_{xy}$ component are disordered and
yet the product of these two develops a true long range order $<S^z \Delta^1>$.
This phase has no analog in purely magnetic spin glasses and arises as a result
of the direct coupling of the impurity spin to the phase of $\Delta^1$. At high
impurity concentrations it is possible that a ferromagnetic phase will form.

high energy e+e- experiments, including results for separated quark and gluon
jets, allow rather direct tests of these results. The theoretical predictions
are generally quite successful when confronted with data. Jet and subjet
multiplicities are described. Multiplicity in limited regions of phase space is
discussed in the context of intermittency and fractality. The problem of
singularities in the generating functions is formulated. Some special features
of average multiplicities in heavy quark jets are described.

suppression of the asymmetry, which increases with energy. Moreover, the
asymmetry is shown to be approximately proportional to x_1 g_1(x_1) x_2 \bar
g_1(x_2), which gives rise to additional suppression at small values of the

expanding, and that spacetime curvature has increased over time. And since time
and space have equal status as dimensions, an object moving through time
experiences increasing spatial curvature due to expansion, just as it does when
moving through space towards a massive body. So expansion must increase
gravity, and this increase would be proportional to the amount of red-shift.
The kinetic energy of expansion is thus exchanged for curvature of spacetime,
and this results in spatial gravity. Momentum therefore fuels both spatial and
massive gravity. And spatial gravity, which must therefore be proportional to
the size of the universe, combines with massive gravity to produce overall
gravity. A cosmological factor proportional to the size of the universe is
therefore appropriate. And the very expansion which causes increasing spatial
gravity, should cause expansion to be self-limiting.

important testing ground for ideas about coding and computation in the nervous
system. A number of results demonstrate that this system operates with a
precision and efficiency near the limits imposed by physics, and more generally
these results point to the reliability and efficiency of the strategies that
nature has selected for representing and processing visual signals. A recent
series of papers by Egelhaaf and coworkers, however, suggests that almost all
these conclusions are incorrect. In this contribution we place these
controversies in a larger context, emphasizing that the arguments are not just
about flies, but rather about how we should quantify the neural response to
complex, naturalistic inputs. As an example, Egelhaaf et al. (and many others)
compute certain correlation functions and use the apparent correlation times as
a measure of temporal precision in the neural response. This analysis neglects
the structure of the correlation function at short times, and we show how to
analyze this structure to reveal a temporal precision 30 times better than
suggested by the correlation time; this precision is confirmed by a much more
detailed information theoretic analysis. In reviewing other aspects of the
controversy, we find that the analysis methods used by Egelhaaf et al. suffer
from some mathematical inconsistencies, and that in some cases we are unable to
reproduce their experimental results. Finally, we present results from new
experiments that probe the neural response to inputs that approach more closely
the natural context for freely flying flies. These new experiments demonstrate
that the fly's visual system is even more precise and efficient under natural
conditions than had been inferred from our earlier work.

coefficients and the covariances between the input and output states. We
discuss why they have this form. We also discuss the physical significance of
the covariance inequality.

time based on the visibility of transmission current. We analyze the tunneling
phenomena with a time-dependent potential and obtain the time-dependent
transmission current. We found that the visibility is directly connected to the
traversal time. Furthermore, this result is valid not only for rectangular
potential barrier but also for general form of potential to which the WKB
approximation is applicable . We compared these results with the numerical
values obtained from the simulation of Nelson's quantum mechanics. Both of them
fit together and it shows our method is very effective to measure
experimentally the traversal time.

can be transferred onto a group of remote two-level particles through two-level
EPRs as many as the number of those particles in this group. We construct such
a kind of teleportation, the realization of which need a nonlocal unitary
transformation to the quantum system that is made up of the s-level particle

the single particles in this system. The unitary transformation to more than
two particles is also written into the product form of two-body unitary
transformations.
