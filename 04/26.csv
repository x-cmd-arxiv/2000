the new 7Li will be very probably removed by ram pressure into the disk.
Globular clusters appear then as possible new sources of 7Li in the galactic

the same population of low mass galaxies identified in recent HST imaging (Koo

irregulars and BCD's. Deviations in the color-magnitude relationship for the

X-ray binaries have most likely been measured by Type I X-ray burst
observations with RXTE. The nearly coherent oscillations detected during the
few seconds of thermonuclear burning are most simply understood as rotational
modulation of brightness asymmetries on the neutron star surface. We show that,
as suggested by Strohmayer and colleagues, the frequency changes of 1-2 Hz
observed during bursts are consistent with angular momentum conservation as the
burning shell hydrostatically expands and contracts. We calculate how vertical
heat propagation through the radiative outer layers of the atmosphere and
convection affect the coherence of the oscillation. We show that the evolution
of the rotational profile depends strongly on whether the burning layers are
composed of pure helium or mixed hydrogen/helium. Our results help explain the
absence (presence) of oscillations from hydrogen-burning (helium-rich) bursts
that was found by Muno and collaborators.
  We investigate angular momentum transport within the burning layers and the
recoupling of the burning layers with the star. We show that the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is quenched by the strong stratification, and that
mixing between the burning fuel and underlying ashes by the baroclinic
instability does not occur. However, the baroclinic instability may have time
to operate within the differentially rotating burning layer, potentially
bringing it into rigid rotation.

HST imaging coupled with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. Using the
multi-waveband data to compare the appearance of galaxies at the same
rest-frame wavelengths reveals that ""morphological k-corrections"" (the change
in appearance when viewing high-z objects at shorter rest-frame wavelengths)
are only important in a minority of cases, and that galaxies were intrinsically
more peculiar at high redshift. One example of significant morphological
k-corrections is spiral galaxies, which often show more pronounced barred
structure in the near-infrared than in the optical. Therefore, the apparent
decline in the fraction of barred spirals at faint magnitudes in the optical
HDF may be due to band-shifting effects at the higher redshifts, rather than
intrinsic evolution. Using such features as the age-sensitive Balmer+4000Ang

metal enrichment occurs as a two step process. First, supernova (SN) explosions
eject metals into relatively small regions confined to the surroundings of
star-forming galaxies. From a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show that
SNae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute the
products of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute the
whole IGM to the metallicity levels observed. Thus, a additional (but as yet
unknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scales
comparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficient
pollutants. From this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testable
predictions for the evolution of the IGM metallicity. Specifically, we find
that: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of the
universe is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals today
are found in the IGM; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed with
the baryons in the universe, the average IGM metallicity would be <Z> ~ 1/25
Z(solar) at z=3. However, due to spatial inhomogeneities, the mean of the
distribution of metallicities in the diffusive zones has a wide (more than 2
orders of magnitude) spread around this value; (iii) if metals become more
uniformly distributed at z < 1, as assumed, at z = 0 the metallicity of the IGM
is narrowly confined within the range Z ~ 0.1 +/- 0.03 Z(solar). Finally, we
point out that our results can account for the observed metal content of the

models of Woosley and Weaver (1995), the data for CS 22876-032 are consistent
with its having been enriched by a zero-metallicity supernova of mass 30
M$_{\odot}$. As the most metal-poor near-main-sequence-turnoff star currently

primordial lithium abundance. We find A(Li) (= log(N(Li)/N(H)) + 12.00) = 2.03

larger than $\kappa_{crit}$, the CR cutoff energy is less than 10 TeV and the

simultaneous spectroscopic measurements of Mkn 501 in a high state by CAT and
BeppoSAX in the framework of the standard homogeneous Synchrotron-Self-Compton

near-infrared background with typical ``starlight spectrum'' around 1 mum
should be between 5 and 35 nW m^-2 sr^-1 (99 % CL), with most likely value
around 20 nW m^-2 sr^-1. Also we argue that the CAT gamma-ray data alone allow
rather robust upper limits on the CIB, lambda F_lambda <= 60 nW m^-2 sr^-1 at 1

flatter than dN/dE == E^-1. This estimate agrees, within statistical and

studied numerically in one and two dimensions from the anticontinuous limit.
This model involves a competition between a local electron-phonon coupling
(with a classical lattice) which tends to form pairs of electrons and the
repulsive Hubbard interaction $U \geq 0$ which tends to break them.
  In 1D, the ground-state always consists in a pair of localized polarons in a
singlet state. They are located at the same site for U=0. Increasing U, there
is a first order transition at which the bipolaron becomes a spin singlet pair
of two polarons bounded by a magnetic interaction. The pinning mode of the
bipolaron soften in the vicinity of this transition leading to a higher
mobility of the bipolaron which is tested numerically.
  In 2D, and for any $U$, the electron-phonon coupling needs to be large enough
in order to form small polarons or bipolarons instead of extended electrons. We
calculate the phase diagram of the bipolaron involving first order transitions
lines with a triple point. A pair of polarons can form three types of
bipolarons: a) on a single site at small $U$, b) a spin singlet state on two
nearest neighbor sites for larger $U$ as in 1D and c) a new intermediate state
obtained as the resonant combination of four 2-sites singlet states sharing a
central site, called quadrisinglet.
  The breathing and pinning internal modes of bipolarons in 2D generally only
weakly soften and thus, they are practically not mobile. On the opposite, in
the vicinity of the triple point involving the quadrisinglet, both modes
exhibit a significant softening. However, it was not sufficient for allowing
the existence of a classical mobile bipolaron (at least in that model).

weak electron-phonon coupling (small g) where the electrons remain free, the
electrons form bipolarons which can 1) be mostly located on a single site
(small $\upsilon$, large g); 2) be an anisotropic pair of polarons lying on two
neighboring sites in the magnetic singlet state (large $\upsilon$, large g); or
3) be a ""quadrisinglet state"" which is the superposition of 4 electronic
singlets with a common central site. This quadrisinglet bipolaron is the most
stable in a small central domain in between the three other phases. The pinning
modes and the Peierls-Nabarro barrier of each of these bipolarons are
calculated and the barrier is found to be strongly depressed in the region of
stability of the quadrisinglet bipolaron.

to get both light and strongly bound bipolarons in the Holstein-Hubbard model
and some variations in the vicinity of the adiabatic limit. Several approaches
to investigate the quantum mobility of polarons and bipolarons are proposed for
this model. It is found that the bipolaron mass generally remains very large
except in the vicinity of the triple point of the phase diagram, where the
bipolarons have several degenerate configurations at the adiabatic limit
(single site (S0), two sites (S1) and quadrisinglet (QS)), while the polarons
are much lighter. This degeneracy reduces the bipolaron mass significantly. The
triple point of the phase diagram is washed out by the lattice quantum
fluctuations which thus suppress the light bipolarons. We show that some model
variations, for example a phonon dispersion may increase the stability of the
(QS) bipolaron against the quantum lattice fluctuations. The triple point of
the phase diagram may be stable to quantum lattice fluctuations and a very
sharp mass reduction may occur, leading to bipolaron masses of the order of 100
bare electronic mass for realistic parameters. Thus such very light bipolarons
could condense as a superconducting state at relatively high temperature when
their interactions are not too large, that is, their density is small enough.
This effect might be relevant for understanding the origin of the high Tc
superconductivity of doped cuprates far enough from half filling.

Here we consider time-reversible models, which necessarily have the property
that every possible point in the state-space is an element of one and only one
cycle.
  As in the dissipative case, when K is large, typical orbit lengths grow
exponentially with N, whereas for small enough K, typical orbit lengths grow
much more slowly with N. The numerical data are consistent with the existence
of a phase transition at which the average orbit length grows as a power of N
at a value of K between 1.4 and 1.7. However, in the reversible models the
interplay between the discrete symmetry and quenched randomness can lead to
enormous fluctuations of orbit lengths and other interesting features that are
unique to the reversible case.
  The orbits can be classified by their behavior under time reversal. The
orbits that transform into themselves under time reversal have properties quite
different from those that do not; in particular, a significant fraction of
latter-type orbits have lengths enormously longer than orbits that are time
reversal-symmetric. For large K and moderate N, the vast majority of points in
the state-space are on one of the time reversal singlet orbits, and a random
hopping model gives an accurate description of orbit lengths. However, for any
finite K, the random hopping approximation fails qualitatively when N is large
enough ($N\gg 2^{(2^K)}$).

depend on the direction of the SAW propagation, but is reversed upon

In the early universe, parametric resonance can drive explosive particle
production called preheating. The fields that are populated then decay quantum
mechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a
driven-dissipative system exists. We have shown previously that pattern
formation can occur in two dimensions in a self-coupled inflaton system
undergoing parametric resonance. In this paper, we provide evidence of pattern
formation for more realistic initial conditions in both two and three
dimensions. In the one-field case, we have the novel interpretation that these
patterns can be thought of as a network of domain walls. We also show that the
patterns are spatio-temporal, leading to a distinctive, but probably
low-amplitude peak in the gravitational wave spectrum. In the context of a
two-field model, we discuss putting power from resonance into patterns on
cosmological scales, in particular to explain the observed excess power at 100
h^{-1}Mpc, but why this seems unlikely in the absence of a period of
post-preheating inflation. Finally we note our model is similar to that of the
decay of DCCs and therefore pattern formation may also occur at RHIC and LHC.

Equivalently, M(G,A) is the (coarse) moduli space of s-equivalence classes of
holomorphic semi-stable G_C-bundles with trivial Chern classes where G_C is the
complexified group.
  M(G,A) has the structure of a hyperkahler orbifold. We show that when G is
Sp(n) or SU(n), M(G,A) has a natural hyperkahler desingularization which we
exhibit as a moduli space of G_C-bundles with an altered stability condition.
In this way, we obtain the two known families of hyperkahler manifolds, the
Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface and the generalized Kummer varieties.
We show that for G not Sp(n) or SU(n), the moduli space M(G,A) does not admit a
hyperkahler resolution, in fact, it does not have a crepant resolution.
  Inspired by the physicists Vafa and Zaslow, Batyrev and Dais define ``stringy
Hodge numbers'' for certain orbifolds. These numbers are conjectured to agree
with the Hodge numbers of a crepant resolution (when it exists). We compute the
stringy Hodge numbers of M(SU(n),A) and M(Sp(n),A) and verify the conjecture in
these cases.
