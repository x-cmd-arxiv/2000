L2-L4. We use the available data on M and L dwarfs to show that chromospheric
activity drops with decreasing mass and temperature, and that at a given (M8 or

provide refined theoretical calibrations and k-corrections needed to use SBFs
as standard candles. We suggest that SBF distance measurements can be improved
by using a filter around 1 micron and calibrating I-band SBFs with the
integrated V-K galaxy color. We also show that current SBF data provide useful
constraints on population synthesis models, and we suggest SBF-based tests for
future models. The data favor specific choices of evolutionary tracks and
spectra in the models among the several choices allowed by comparisons based on
only integrated light. In addition, the tightness of the empirical I-band SBF
calibration suggests that model uncertainties in post-main sequence lifetimes
are less than +/-50% and that the IMF in ellipticals is not much steeper than
that in the solar neighborhood. Finally, we analyze the potential of SBFs for
probing unresolved stellar populations. We find that optical/near-IR SBFs are
much more sensitive to metallicity than to age. Therefore, SBF magnitudes and
colors are a valuable tool to break the age/metallicity degeneracy. Our initial
results suggest that the most luminous stellar populations of bright cluster
galaxies have roughly solar metallicities and about a factor of three spread in

strange quark mass and the QCD coupling constant. The linear approximation of
the equation of state is found and the parameters of this EOS are determined as
a functions of strange quark mass, QCD coupling constant and bag constant. This
approximation reproduces exact results within an error of the order of 1% and
can be used for the complete study of the properties of strange stars including
microscopic stability of strange matter and determination of the total baryon
number of the star.

different physical mechanisms. The analytic estimates are compared by numerical

characteristic of ordinary glasses: strong metastability of the supercooled
liquid, a weak increase of the characteristic length under cooling,
stretched-exponential relaxation and aging. The addition of two-spin
interactions, in general, destroys such behaviour: the liquid phase loses
metastability and the slow-dynamics regime terminates well below the melting
transition, which is presumably related with a certain corner-rounding
transition. However, for a particular choice of interaction constants, when the
ground state is strongly degenerate, our simulations suggest that the
slow-dynamics regime extends up to the melting transition. The analysis of

decoherence times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using
``adiabatic inversion'', where one macroscopic fluxoid state is smoothly
transferred into the other, like a spin reversing direction by following a
slowly moving magnetic field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external
applied flux, and depends on a well-defined quantum phase between the two
macroscopic states. Varying the speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence
time permits one to move from the quantum regime, where such a well-defined
phase exists, to the classical regime where it is lost and the inversion is
inhibited. Thus observing whether inversion has taken place or not as a
function of sweep speed offers the possibility of measuring the decoherence
time. The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that
the low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be
long compared to other time scales of the problem.
  Applications to the ``quantum computer'', with the level system of the SQUID
playing the role of the qbit, are briefly discussed.

the Shifman-Voloshin limit $\Lambda \ll \delta m=m_b - m_c \ll m_b, m_c$ is
studied within a nonrelativistic potential model. The integrated semileptonic
decay rate is calculated in two ways: first, by constructing the Operator
Product Expansion, and second by a direct summation of the exclusive channels.
Sum rules (Bjorken, Voloshin, etc.) for the potential model are derived,
providing a possibility to compare the two representations for $\Gamma(B\to X_c
l\nu)$. An explicit difference between them referred to as duality-violation
effect is found. The origin of this effect is related to higher charm
resonances which are kinematically forbidden in the decay process but are
nevertheless picked up by the OPE.
  Within the considered $1/m_c^2$ order the OPE and the sum over exclusive
channels match each other, up to the contributions of higher resonances, by
virtue of the sum rules. In particular this is true for the terms of order
$\delta m^2/m_c^2$ and $\Lambda \delta m/m_c^2$ which are present in each of
the decay channels and cancel in the sum of these channels due to the Bjorken
and Voloshin sum rules, respectively. The size of the duality violation effects
is estimated to be of the order $O(\Lambda^{2+b}/m_c^2\delta m^b)$ with $b>0$

significantly for low $\tan\beta(<4)$ when $m_{H^+}<300$GeV, which exceed -12%.
For high $\tan\beta$ the Yukawa corrections become negligibly small. The
genuine supersymmetric electroweak corrections can increase or decrease the
total cross sections depending on the supersymmetric parameters, which are at
most a few percent, except the region near the threshold. We also show that the

Zwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio, which is related to the non-linear

recently shown that this modified quantization scheme is in fact identical to
the conventional {\em local} Faddeev-Popov formula {\em without} taking the
large mass limit, if one takes into account the variation of the gauge field
along the entire gauge orbit and if the Gribov complications can be ignored.
This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example, is
interpreted in a more flexible manner either as a gauge invariant theory with a
gauge fixing term added, or as a conventional massive non-gauge theory. As for
massive gauge particles, the Higgs mechanics, where the mass term is gauge
invariant, has a more intrinsic meaning.
  It is suggested to extend the notion of quantum gauge symmetry (BRST
symmetry) not only to classical gauge theory but also to a wider class of
theories whose gauge symmetry is broken by some extra terms in the classical

composite system in an arbitrary reference frame in QCD. After a brief review
of the difficulties one encounters in equal-time quantization, we turn to
light-front quantization. We show that, in spite of the complexities,
light-front field theory offers a unique opportunity to address the issue of
relativistic spin operators in an arbitrary reference frame since boost is
kinematical in this formulation. Utilizing this symmetry, we show how to
introduce transverse spin operators for massless particles in an arbitrary
reference frame in analogy with those for massive particles. Starting from the
manifestly gauge invariant, symmetric energy momentum tensor in QCD, we derive
expressions for the interaction dependent transverse spin operators ${\cal
J}^i$ ($i=1,2$) which are responsible for the helicity flip of the nucleon in
light-front quantization. In order to construct ${\cal J}^i$, first we derive
expressions for the transverse rotation operators $F^i$. In the gauge $A^+=0$,
we eliminate the constrained variables. In the completely gauge fixed sector,
in terms of the dynamical variables, we show that one can decompose ${\cal
J}^i= {\cal J}^i_I + {\cal J}^i_{II} + {\cal J}^i_{III}$ where only ${\cal
J}^i_{I}$ has explicit coordinate ($x^-, x^i$) dependence in its integrand. The
operators ${\cal J}^i_{II}$ and ${\cal J}^i_{III}$ arise from the fermionic and

the helicity operator which is interaction independent in the topologically

relevance of such a decomposition. We perform a one loop renormalization of the
full transverse spin operator in light-front Hamiltonian perturbation theory
for a dressed quark state. We explicitly show that all the terms dependent on
the center of mass momenta get canceled in the matrix element. The entire
non-vanishing contribution comes from the fermion intrinsic -like part of the
transverse spin operator as a result of cancellation between the gluonic
intrinsic-like and the orbital-like part of the transverse spin operator. We
compare and contrast the calculations of transverse spin and helicity of a

simulations that, for the chosen current sweeping procedure used in the present

narrow line structures in the measured energy spectra. The measured positron
spectra do not show evidence for line structures within the statistical
accuracy achieved, although expected from the intensities of the observed
$\gamma$ transitions (E$_{\gamma}~1250-1600$ keV) and theoretical conversion
coefficients. This is due to the reduced detection efficiency for IPC
positrons, caused by the limited spatial and momentum acceptance of the

that space and time of an inertial observer $\Sigma$ are most conveniently

`tickmarks' and connected by independent quantized harmonic oscillators which
vibrate more severely the faster $\Sigma$ moves with respect to the object
being measured (due to the Uncertainty Principle). The Lorentz transformation
of Special Relativity is derived. Further, mass is understood as a localized
region $\Delta \Lambda$ having higher vibration temperature than that of the
ambient lattice. The effect of relativistic mass increase may then be
calculated without appealing to energy-momentum conservation. The origin of
gravitation is shown to be simply a transport of energy from the boundary of
$\Delta \Lambda$ outwards by lattice phonon conduction, as the system tends
towards equilibrium. Application to a single point mass leads readily to the
Schwarzschild metric, while a new solution is available for two point masses -
a situation where General Relativity is too complicated to work with. The
important consequence is that inertial observers who move at relative speeds
too close to $c$ are no longer linked by the Lorentz transformation, because
the lattice of the `moving' observer has already disintegrated into a liquid

the relative von Neumann entropy between density matrices to their trace
distance and uses a new measure of information. We also describe a classical
probabilistic $k$ round protocol with communication
$O(n/k\cdot(\log^{(k/2)}n+\log k)+k\log n)$ in which Bob starts the
communication. Furthermore as a consequence of the lower bound for pointer
jumping we show that any $k$ round quantum protocol for the disjointness
problem needs communication $\Omega(n^{1/k})$ for $k=O(1)$.

dielectric is explicitly obtained from a fully microscopic
quantum-electrodynamical, many-body derivation of Langevin-Bloch operator
equations for two-level atoms embedded in an absorptive and dispersive, linear
dielectric host. We find that the dielectric local-field enhancement of the
spontaneous emission rate is smaller than indicated by previous studies.
