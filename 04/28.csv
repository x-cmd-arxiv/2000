secondaries in coincidence with BATSE gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Each TeV gamma
ray striking the atmosphere produces $\approx$0.2 muons whose identity and
angle can be measured by the Project GRAND array. Eight GRB candidates were
studied; seven were selected based upon the optimum product of (detected BATSE
fluence) $\times$ (GRAND's acceptance). One candidate was added because it was
reported as a detection by the Milagrito collaboration. Seven candidates show a
positive, though not statistically significant, muon excess. The most
significant possible coincidence shows an excess of $466 \pm 171$ muons during
the BATSE T90 time interval. It is also of interest that the event with the
second most significant signal to noise (1.2$\sigma$) is the Milagrito event.
If our most significant event is real, the implied fluence of energetic ($> 10$
GeV) gammas necessary to account for the observed muon excess would require
that most of the GRB fluence arrived in the form of energetic gammas.

associated absorption lines of OVI 1032,1038, CIII 977, and Lyman lines through

range of -440 to +170 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. The absorption is
clustered in two groups, one centered at -370m km/s and another at the systemic
velocity. The blue-shifted cluster may be associated with the extended line
emission visible in deep images of Mrk 509 obtained by Phillips et al. Although
several components appear to be saturated, they are not black at their centers.
Partial covering or scattering permits ~7% of the broad-line or continuum flux
to be unaffected by absorption. Of the multiple components, only one has the

the OVII and OVIII ionization edges in X-ray spectra of Mrk 509.

systems (about seven orders of magnitude in mass) to constrain hypothetical
dark matter candidates and scenarios of structure formation. First, we argue
that neither generic warm dark matter (collisionless or collisional) nor
self-interacting dark matter can be responsible for the observed cores on all
scales. Both scenarios predict smaller cores for higher mass systems, in
conflict with observations; some cores must instead have a dynamical origin.
Second, we show that the core phase space densities of dwarf spheroidals,
rotating dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and clusters of galaxies
decrease with increasing velocity dispersion like Q ~ sigma^-3 ~ M^-1, as
predicted by a simple scaling argument based on merging equilibrium systems,
over a range of about eight orders of magnitude in Q. We discuss the processes
which set the overall normalization of the observed phase density hierarchy. As
an aside, we note that the observed phase-space scaling behavior and density
profiles of dark matter halos both resemble stellar components in elliptical
galaxies, likely reflecting a similar collisionless, hierarchical origin. Thus,
dark matter halos may suffer from the same systematic departures from homology
as seen in ellipticals, possibly explaining the shallower density profiles
observed in low mass halos. Finally, we use the maximum observed phase space
density in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to fix a minimum mass for relativistically
decoupled warm dark matter candidates of roughly 700 eV for thermal fermions,
and 300 eV for degenerate fermions.

polarization of the broad Mg II emission line is high (~ 29%), consistent with
the remarkably high polarization (~ 30%-40%) observed in the extended continuum
emission. The narrow emission lines are polarized in a stratified fashion, with
the high ionization lines being polarized 0.7%-1.7% and [O II] essentially
unpolarized. The line polarizations are positively correlated with critical
density, ionization potential, and velocity width of the emission lines. This
indicates that the NLR may be partially shadowed by the putative torus, with
the higher ionization lines originating closer to the nucleus. One notable
characteristic of the extranuclear knot is that all species of Fe are markedly
absent in its spectrum, while they appear prominently in the nucleus. Our
favored interpretation is that there is a large amount of dust in the
extranuclear regions, allowing gaseous refractory metals to deposit. The
extended emission regions are most likely material shredded from nearby cluster
members and not gas condensed from the cooling flow or expelled from the
obscured quasar. Our data provide strong evidence for matter-bounded clouds in

IMFs in these sites of clustered star formation are similar over a wide range
of stellar densities and other environmental conditions. With current data, we
cannot rule out modest variations in the substellar mass functions among these
clusters. We then make the best estimate of the true form of the IMF in the
Trapezium by using the evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. and an empirically
adjusted temperature scale and compare this mass function to recent results for
the Pleiades and the field. All of these data are consistent with an IMF that
is flat or rises slowly from the substellar regime to about 0.6 Msun, and then
rolls over into a power law that continues from about 1 Msun to higher masses
with a slope similar to or somewhat larger than the Salpeter value of 1.35. For
the Trapezium, this behavior holds from our completeness limit of ~0.02 Msun
and probably, after a modest completeness correction, even from 0.01-0.02 Msun.

there are viable models that attribute their X-ray emission to thermal emission
from the surface of a neutron star. Inferring the surface area of the emitting
regions in such systems is crucial in assessing the viability of different
models and in providing bounds on the radii of neutron stars. We show that the
inferred areas of the emitting regions may be over- or under-estimated by a
factor of <=2, because of the geometry of the system and general relativistic
light deflection, combined with the effects of phase averaging. Such effects
make the determination of neutron-star radii uncertain, especially when
compared to the ~5% level required for constraining the equation of state of
neutron-star matter. We also note that, for a given spectral shape, the
inferred source luminosities and pulse fractions are anticorrelated because
they depend on the same properties of the emitting regions, namely their sizes
and orientations, i.e., brighter sources have on average weaker pulsation
amplitudes than fainter sources. We argue that this property can be used as a
diagnostic tool in distinguishing between different spectral models. As an
example, we show that the high inferred pulse fraction and brightness of the
pulsar RXS J1708-40 are inconsistent with isotropic thermal emission from a
neutron-star surface. Finally, we discuss the implication of our results for
surveys in the soft X-rays for young, cooling neutron stars in supernova

the wavelength region 6100--7100 AA obtained over one week, using techniques
similar to those we applied to another roAp star, Alpha Cir.
  We confirm that the H-alpha velocity amplitude of HR 3831 is modulated with
rotation phase. Such a modulation was predicted by the oblique pulsator model,
and rules out the spotted pulsator model. However, further analysis of H-alpha
and other lines reveal rotational modulations that cannot easily be explained
using the oblique pulsator model. In particular, the phase of the pulsation as
measured by the width of the H-alpha line varies with height in the line.
  The variation of the H-alpha bisector shows a very similar pattern to that
observed in Alpha Cir, which we have previously attributed to a radial node in
the stellar atmosphere. However, the striking similarities between the two
stars despite the much shorter period of Alpha Cir (6.8 min) argues against
this interpretation unless the structure of the atmosphere is somewhat
different between the two stars. Alternatively, the bisector variation is a
signature of the degree l of the mode and not the overtone value n.

understand fully the form of the pulsation in the atmosphere.

many cases the energy flux emitted during an event of production of GWs is not
known in detail, only characteristic values for the dimensionless amplitude and

structure of the Cooper pair wave function is soft, and thus lead to
""pseudogap"" behavior in which the actual transition temperature is greatly
depressed from its mean field value. These fluctuations are {\it not} phase
fluctuations of the standard superconducting order parameter, and lead to a
highly unusual Ginzburg-Landau description. We suggest that the crossover
between the BCS limit of a short-ranged attraction and our problem is of

interacting through the isotropic two-body potential v(r-r'), a celebrated
theorem due to Luttinger (1961) states that under the_assumption_ of validity
of the many-body perturbation theory the self-energy Sigma(k;epsilon), with 0
<,= k <,~ 3 k_F (where k_F stands for the Fermi wavenumber), satisfies the
following universal asymptotic relation as epsilon approaches the Fermi energy
epsilon_F: Im[Sigma(k;epsilon)] ~ -,+ alpha_k (epsilon-epsilon_F)^2, epsilon
>,< epsilon_F, with alpha_k >,= 0. As this is, by definition, specific to
self-energies of Landau Fermi-liquid systems, treatment of non-Fermi-liquid
systems are therefore thought to lie outside the domain of applicability of the
many-body perturbation theory; that, for these systems, the many-body
perturbation theory should_necessarily_ break down. We demonstrate that
Im[Sigma(k;epsilon)] ~ -,+ alpha_k (epsilon-epsilon_F)^2, epsilon >,<
epsilon_F, is_implicit_ in Luttinger's proof and that, for d > 1, in principle
nothing prohibits a non-Fermi-liquid-type (and, in particular
Luttinger-liquid-type) Sigma(k;epsilon) from being obtained within the
framework of the many-body perturbation theory. We in addition indicate how
seemingly innocuous Taylor expansions of the self-energy with respect to k,
epsilon or both amount to tacitly assuming that the metallic system under
consideration is a Fermi liquid, whether the self-energy is calculated
perturbatively or otherwise. Proofs that a certain metallic system is in a
Fermi-liquid state, based on such expansions, are therefore tautologies.

Just at the upper critical dimensions we find universal logarithmic corrections

digital image processing,in particular, image edge detection, and numerical
shock capturing. Indeed, numerical shock capturing can be formulated on the
lines of iterative digital edge detection. Various anisotropic diffusion and
super diffusion operators originated from image edge detection are proposed for
the treatment of hyperbolic conservation laws and near-hyperbolic hydrodynamic
equations of change. The similarity between anisotropic diffusion and
artificial viscosity is discussed. Physical origins and mathematical properties
of the artificial viscosity is analyzed from the kinetic theory point of view.
A form of pressure tensor is derived from the first principles of the quantum
mechanics. Quantum kinetic theory is utilized to arrive at macroscopic
transport equations from the microscopic theory. Macroscopic symmetry is used
to simplify pressure tensor expressions. The latter provides a basis for the
design of artificial viscosity. The ADOR approach is validated by using
(inviscid) Burgers' equation in one and two spatial dimensions, the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the Euler equation. A discrete

dual reciprocity principle (DRM), this paper presents an inheretnly meshless,
exponential convergence, integration-free, boundary-only collocation techniques
for numerical solution of general partial differential equation systems. The
basic ideas behind this methodology are very mathematically simple and
generally effective. The RBFs are used in this study to approximate the
inhomogeneous terms of system equations in terms of the DRM, while non-singular
general solution leads to a boundary-only RBF formulation. The present method
is named as the boundary knot method (BKM) to differentiate it from the other
numerical techniques. In particular, due to the use of non-singular general
solutions rather than singular fundamental solutions, the BKM is different from
the method of fundamental solution in that the former does no need to introduce
the artificial boundary and results in the symmetric system equations under
certain conditions. It is also found that the BKM can solve nonlinear partial
differential equations one-step without iteration if only boundary knots are
used. The efficiency and utility of this new technique are validated through
some typical numerical examples. Some promising developments of the BKM are
also discussed.

Three distinct Dirac structures are compared: $i\gamma_5$,

  From the dependence of the OPE on general baryon interpolating fields, we
propose criteria for choosing an appropriate Dirac structure for the coupling

the $i\gamma_5\fslash{p}$ sum rules, the large continuum contributions prohibit
reliable prediction for the couplings. Thus, the $\gamma_5\sigma_{\mu\nu}q^\mu

we identify the OPE terms responsible for the $F/D$ ratio. We then study the

open shell structure of Si, including a marked transition from efficient to
poor screening behavior as a test majority-spin electron is moved from the
center of a valence 3p orbital onto the axis perpendicular to the occupied 3p

hole in the two cases, which is partially compensated by a corresponding
anisotropy in the correlation hole. In addition we observe an anisotropic
change in the spin density induced by Coulomb correlation, reducing the spatial
overlap between the different spin-components of the density and contributing
to the anisotropy of the correlation hole. In contrast to the longer range

is developed; such fluctuations are the magnetic analog of Johnson noise. For
realistic experiments in quantum computing and magnetic resonance force
microscopy, the predicted relaxation can be rapid enough that substantial
experimental care should be taken to minimize it. The same Hamiltonian matrix
elements that govern fluctuation and dissipation are shown to also govern
entanglement and renormalization, and a specific example of a
fluctuation-dissipation-entanglement theorem is constructed.

qubits are represented by single cavity modes restricted in the space spanned
by the two lowest Fock states. We show that single qubit operations and
universal multiple qubit gates can be implemented using atoms sequentially
crossing the cavities.
