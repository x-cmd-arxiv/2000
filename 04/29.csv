27 degrees along the line of sight. The small-aperture HST data also allow us
to detect, for the first time, the featureless continuum at optical wavelengths
in NGC 4450; the nonstellar nucleus is intrinsically very faint, with M_B =
-11.2 mag for D = 16.8 Mpc. We have examined the multiwavelength properties of
NGC 4450 collectively with those of other low-luminosity active nuclei which
possess double-peaked broad lines and find a number of common features. These
objects are all classified spectroscopically as ""type 1"" LINERs or closely
related objects. The nuclear luminosities are low, both in absolute terms and
relative to the Eddington rates. All of them have compact radio cores, whose
strength relative to the optical nuclear emission places them in the league of
radio-loud active nuclei. The broad-band spectral energy distributions of these
sources are most notable for their deficit of ultraviolet emission compared to
those observed in luminous Seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars. The double-peaked
broad-line radio galaxies Arp 102B and Pictor A have very similar attributes.
We discuss how these characteristics can be understood in the context of
advection-dominated accretion onto massive black holes.

and for the case of G191-B2B, the interstellar cloud that immediately surrounds
the solar system. Toward these targets the interstellar abundances of Ar I, and
sometimes N I, are significantly below their cosmic abundances relative to H I.
In the diffuse interstellar medium, these elements are not likely to be
depleted onto dust grains. Generally, we expect that Ar should be more strongly
ionized than H (and also O and N whose ionizations are coupled to that of H via
charge exchange reactions) because the cross section for the photoionization of
Ar I is very high. Our finding that Ar I/H I is low may help to explain the
surprisingly high ionization of He in the LISM found by other investigators.
Our result favors the interpretation that the ionization of the local medium is
maintained by a strong EUV flux from nearby stars and hot gases, rather than an
incomplete recovery from a past, more highly ionized condition.

of eclipses observed (17), and the higher count rate in the detector (0.5-2.2
counts/s), we are able to significantly strengthen previous reports that there
is little or no eclipse by the secondary of the EUV emission region of OY Car

broad (FWHM~1 A) emission lines of N V, O V-O VI, Ne V-Ne VII, Mg IV-Mg VI, Fe

obtained with a model (similar to that of Seyfert 2 galaxies) wherein radiation
from the boundary layer and accretion disk is scattered into the line of sight
by the system's photoionized accretion disk wind. It is possible to trade off
continuum luminosity for wind optical depth, but reasonable models have a
boundary layer temperature T_{bl}=90-130 kK and a boundary layer and accretion
disk luminosity L_{bl}=L_{disk} ~4x10^{34} erg/s ~ 10 Lsun, corresponding to a

divergent density profiles. An extensive body of rotation curve observations of
dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies shows the dark haloes of those
systems to be characterized by soft constant density central cores. Several
physical processes have been proposed to produce soft cores in dark haloes,
each one with different scaling properties. With the aim of discriminating
among them we have examined the rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf
and low surface brightness galaxies and the inner mass profiles of two clusters
of galaxies lacking a central cD galaxy and with evidence of soft cores in the
centre. The core radii and central densities of these haloes scale in a well
defined manner with the depth of their potential wells, as measured through the
maximum circular velocity. As a result of our analysis we identify
self-interacting CDM as a viable solution to the core problem, where a
non-singular isothermal core is formed in the halo center surrounded by a
Navarro, Frenk, & White profile in the outer parts. We show that this
particular physical situation predicts core radii in agreement with
observations. Furthermore, using the observed scalings, we derive an expression
for the minimum cross section (\sigma) which has an explicit dependence with
the halo dispersion velocity (v). If m_x is the mass of the dark matter

two quantities are significantly correlated. The following conclusions are then
reached: (1) the existence of two classes of GRBs is confirmed; (2) the
hardness ratio and the duration are not at all correlated for any of the two

at finite frequency, and for branched N-S junctions at zero frequency. The
noise spectral density displays a singularity at the Josephson frequency
($\omega = 2eV/\hbar$) when the applied bias is smaller than gap of the
superconductor. Yet, in the limit $eV\gg \Delta$, quasiparticle contributions
yield a singularity at $\omega = eV/\hbar$ analogous to that of a normal metal.
The crossover between these two regimes shows new structures in the noise
characteristic, pointing out the failure of the effective charge model. As an
alternative to a finite frequency measurement, if a sinusoidal external field
is superposed to the constant bias (non stationary Aharonov--Bohm effect), the
second derivative of the zero frequency noise with respect to the voltage
exhibits peaks when the frequency of the perturbation is commensurate with the
Josephson frequency. Finally, the statistical aspects of noise are studied with
an analog of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss experiment for fermions: a
superconductor connected to two normal leads. Noise correlations are found to
be either negative (fermionic) or positive (bosonic), due to the presence of
evanescent Cooper pairs in the normal side of the junction, in the latter case.

the zero-frequency $\delta$-function in the optical conductivity has an
anomalous contribution from high frequencies, due to lowering of the system's
kinetic energy upon entering the superconducting state. The lowering of kinetic
energy, mainly in-plane in origin, accounts for both the condensation energy of
the superconductor as well as an increased potential energy due to larger
Coulomb repulsion in the paired state. It leads to an apparent violation of the
conductivity sum rule, which in the clean limit we predict to be substantially
larger for in-plane than for c-axis conductivity. However, because cuprates are
in the dirty limit for c-axis transport, the sum rule violation is found to be
greatly enhanced in the c-direction. The model predicts the sum rule violation
to be largest in the underdoped regime and to decrease with doping, more
rapidly in the c-direction that in the plane. So far, experiments have detected
sum rule violation in c-axis transport in several cuprates, as well as a
decrease and disappearance of this violation for increasing doping, but no

describes the particular physical properties of charge carriers in polarizable
solids but also because it constitutes an interesting field theoretical model
of a fermion interacting with a scalar boson field. The early work on polarons
was concerned with general theoretical formulations and approximations, which
now constitute the standard polaron theory, and with experiments on cyclotron
resonance and transport properties. Because of the more recent interest in the
two-dimensional electron gas, the study of the polaron in two dimensions became
important. Again cyclotron resonance, and therefore the behaviour of polarons
in magnetic fields, was a key issue. When two electrons (or two holes) interact
with each other simultaneously through the Coulomb force and via the
electron-phonon-electron interaction, either two independent polarons can occur
or a bound state of two polarons - a bipolaron - can arise. Bipolarons have
been considered to possibly play a role in high-Tc superconductivity. The
polaron concept has been extended to several systems where one or many fermions
interact with a bath of bosons, e. g., small polaron, piezopolaron, polaronic

the implementation of gauge invariance; they do not arise when the theory is
represented in terms of gauge-dependent fields and Gauss's law is left
unimplemented.

"physics/0005001","Michael Byrne","Michael Byrne","Quantum Gravity","Author believes that the statements are no longer valid",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Gravitons should have momentum just as photons do; and since graviton
momentum would cause compression rather than elongation of spacetime outside of
matter; it does not appear that gravitons are compatible with Swartzchild's
spacetime curvature. Also, since energy is proportional to mass, and mass is
proportional to gravity; the energy of matter is proportional to gravity. The
energy of matter could thus contract space within matter; and because of the
inter-connectedness of space, cause the elongation of space outside of matter.
And this would be compatible with Swartzchild spacetime curvature. Since
gravity could be initiated within matter by the energy of mass, transmitted to
space outside of matter by the inter-connectedness of space; and also
transmitted through space by the same inter-connectedness of space; and since
spatial and relativistic gravities can apparently be produced without the aid
of gravitons; massive gravity could also be produced without gravitons as well.
  Gravity divided by an infinite number of segments would result in zero
expression of gravity, because it could not curve spacetime. So spatial
segments must have a minimum size, which is the Planck length; thus resulting
in quantized space. And since gravity is always expressed over some distance in
space, quantum space would therefore always quantize gravity. So the
non-mediation of gravity by gravitons does not result in unquantized gravity,
because quantum space can quantize gravity; thus making gravitons unproven and
unnecessary, and explaining why gravitons have never been found.

assumption: that local hidden-variable theories produce a set of

that particles are emitted in a superposition of states the theory cannot
produce such a set of probabilities. We examine a paper by Eberhard, and
several similar papers, which claim to show that a generalized Bell inequality,
the CHSH inequality, can be derived solely on the basis of the locality
condition, without recourse to hidden variables. We point out that these
authors nonetheless assumes a set of positive-definite probabilities, which
supports the claim that hidden variables or ""locality"" is not at issue here,
positive-definite probabilities are. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics does
predict a set of probabilities that violate the CHSH inequality; however these
probabilities are not positive-definite. Nevertheless, they are physically
meaningful in that they give the usual quantum-mechanical predictions in
physical situations. We discuss in what sense our results are related to the
