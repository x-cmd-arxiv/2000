understanding the formation of globular cluster systems, and in particular in
verifying scenarios in which globular cluster systems of larger galaxies formed
(at least partly) from the accretion of dwarf galaxies. Here, we revisit the
globular cluster system of the dE,N galaxy NGC 3115 DW1 - a companion of the
nearby S0 galaxy NGC 3115 - adding Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and HST/WFPC2 imaging
to previous ground-based photometry. Spectra for seven globular clusters reveal
normal abundance ratios with respect to the Milky Way and M31 clusters, as well
as a relatively high mean metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.0+/-0.1 dex). Crude
kinematics indicate a high velocity dispersion within 10 kpc which could either
be caused by dark matter dominated outer regions, or by the stripping of outer
globular clusters by the nearby giant galaxy NGC 3115. The total galaxy mass
out to 3 and 10 kpc lies between 10^10 and 10^11 solar masses and 2*10^10 and
4*10^11 solar masses, respectively, depending on the mass estimator used and
the assumptions on cluster orbits and systemic velocity. The HST imaging allows
measurement of sizes for two clusters, returning core radii around 2.0 pc,
similar to the sizes observed in other galaxies. Spectroscopy allows an
estimate of the degree of contamination by foreground stars or background
galaxies for the previous ground-based photometry, but does not require a
revision of previous results: NGC 3115 DW1 hosts around 60+/-20 clusters which
corresponds to a specific frequency of 4.9+/-1.9, on the high end for massive
dEs. Given its absolute magnitude (M_V=-17.7 mag) and the properties of its
cluster system, NGC 3115 DW1 appears to be a transition between a luminous dE
and low-luminosity E galaxy.

theories for galaxy bias. We show that the low-order clustering statistics of
the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and
density profiles of dark-matter haloes. A hypothetical galaxy catalogue depends
on (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation
number -- the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a
halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo.
The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups.
For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with
any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. These
simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the
probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass
density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current
interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy
correlations for a flat $\Omega=0.3$ model ($\Lambda$CDM), but not for an
$\Omega=1$ model with the same power spectrum ($\tau$CDM). This is an
inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra:
cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high $\Omega$,
and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise
velocity dispersion of galaxies in the $\Lambda$CDM model is lower than that of
the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number
for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of
galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.

with 40 mA (4-sigma) Lyb detection limits, we have employed the equivalent
width ratio of Lyb/Lya and occasionally higher Lyman lines, to determine the
doppler parameter, b, and accurate column densities, N(HI), for moderately
saturated lines. We detect Lyb absorption corresponding to all Lya lines with
EW > 200 mA. The Lyb/Lya ratios yield a preliminary distribution function of
doppler parameters, with mean <b> = 31.4 +/- 7.4 km/s and median b = 28 km/s,
comparable to values at redshifts z = 2.0-2.5. If thermal, these b-values
correspond to T(HI) ~ 50,000 K, although the inferred doppler parameters are
considerably less than the widths derived from Lya profile fitting,
<b(dopp)/b(width)> = 0.52. The typical increase in column density over that
derived from profile fitting is Delta[log N(HI)] = 0.3, but ranges up to 1.0
dex. Our data suggest that the low-z Lya absorbers contain sizable non-thermal
motions or velocity components in the line profile, perhaps arising from
cosmological expansion and infall.

to be in the Local Group, and the outer Galaxy. The fraction of O VI in HVCs
along the seven sight lines containing high velocity O VI averages about 30
percent, with a full range of 10-70 percent. The O VI detections imply that hot
(log T(K) = 5-6) collisionally-ionized gas is an important constituent of the
HVCs since O VI is difficult to produce by photoionization unless the path
lengths over which the absorption occurs are very large (>100 kpc). The
association of O VI with H I HVCs in many cases suggests that the O VI may be
produced at interfaces or mixing layers between the H I clouds and hot, low
density gas in the Galactic corona or Local Group. Alternatively, the O VI may
originate within cooling regions of hot gas clouds as they are accreted onto

to further approximations, whose quality is tested in a scalar toy model. In
contrast to the direct HTL/HDL-resummation of the one-loop free energy, in our
approach both the leading-order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO)
effects of interactions are correctly reproduced and arise from kinematical
regimes where the HTL/HDL are justifiable approximations. The LO effects are
entirely due to the (asymptotic) thermal masses of the hard particles. The NLO
ones receive contributions both from soft excitations, as described by the
HTL/HDL propagators, and from corrections to the dispersion relation of the
hard excitations, as given by HTL/HDL perturbation theory. The numerical
evaluations of our final expressions show very good agreement with lattice data

  January 2000 American Math Society meeting, minor errors corrected in version
  2",,,,"quant-ph",,"  These notes discuss the quantum algorithms we know of that can solve problems
significantly faster than the corresponding classical algorithms. So far, we
have only discovered a few techniques which can produce speed up versus
classical algorithms. It is not clear yet whether the reason for this is that
we do not have enough intuition to discover more techniques, or that there are
only a few problems for which quantum computers can significantly speed up the
solution.
