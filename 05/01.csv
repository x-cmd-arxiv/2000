Andromeda IV is an enigmatic object first discovered during van den Bergh's

higher surface brightness than other known dwarf spheroidals, it has been
suggested that And IV is either a relatively old `star cloud' in the outer disk
of M31 or a background dwarf galaxy. We present deep HST WFPC2 observations of
And IV and the surrounding field which, along with ground-based long-slit
spectroscopy and Halpha imagery, are used to decipher the true nature of this
puzzling object. We find compelling evidence that And IV is a background galaxy
seen through the disk of M31. The moderate surface brightness (SB(V)~24), very
blue colour (V-I<~0.6), low current star formation rate (~0.001 solar mass/yr)
and low metallicity (~10% solar) reported here are consistent with And IV being
a small dwarf irregular galaxy, perhaps similar to Local Group dwarfs such as
IC 1613 and Sextans A. Although the distance to And IV is not tightly
constrained with the current dataset, various arguments suggest it lies in the
range 5<~D<~8 Mpc, placing it well outside the confines of the Local Group. It
may be associated with a loose group of galaxies, containing major members UGC
64, IC 1727 and NGC 784. We report an updated position and radial velocity for
And IV.

continuum emission and the reflected fluorescent iron line from a primary X-ray
source near a Kerr black hole. The X-ray source is located above an accretion
disc orbiting around the black hole. The source is assumed to be a static point
source located on an arbitrary position above the disc, on or off the axis of
rotation. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate the iron
line spectrum as well as its equivalent width. Because of the gravitational
lensing effect, an enhancement of the iron line is expected when the primary
source is located close to the central black hole. We find that for a source
located on the axis of rotation the enhancement is relatively modest. An
observer at inclination 30 degrees would measure an equivalent width of ~300eV
in the extreme case of a maximally rotating black hole and a source located at
height 1.5 gravitational radius from the centre. This corresponds to an
equivalent width enhancement factor of about 2 compared to the classical value
where no lensing effect comes into play. However, when allowing the source to
be located off the axis of rotation, much stronger enhancement can be obtained.
In the extreme case of a maximally rotating black hole and a source located
just above the approaching side of the disc, an observer at inclination 30d
egrees could measure an equivalent width as high as ~1.5 keV (i.e. ~10 times
the classical value). We also find that observers located at high inclination
angles observe a stronger line than observers at low inclination angles.

long-baseline experiments. We address the benefit of a high-granularity,
excellent-calorimetry non-magnetized target-detector, which provides a
background-free identification of electron neutrino charged current and a
kinematical selection of tau neutrino charged current interactions. We assume
that charge discrimination is only available for muons reaching an external

electron, right-sign muon, wrong-sign muon and no-lepton categories. In
addition, high granularity permits a clean detection of quasi-elastic events,
which by detecting the final state proton, provide a selection of the neutrino
electron helicity without the need of an electron charge measurement. From
quantitative analyses of neutrino oscillation scenarios, we conclude that in
many cases the discovery sensitivities and the measurements of the oscillation
