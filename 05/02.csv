the characteristics of runaway O and B stars which are ejected by the supernova
explosion of the companion star in a binary system. The number of OB runaways
can be explained from supernova ejections only if: high mass stars are
preferentially formed in binaries, the initial mass ratio distribution is
strongly peaked to unity and stars are rejuvenated to zero age upon accretion
of mass from a companion star. Taking these requirements into consideration we
conclude that at most 30% of the runaway O stars but possibly all runaway B
stars obtain high velocities due to supernovae in evolving binaries. Stars
which obtain high velocities via supernova ejections have the following
characteristics: 1) at least 10% of the high velocity B stars and half the O
stars have a mass greater than the turn off mass of the cluster in which they
are born and would be observed as blue stragglers in the parent cluster, 2)
their equatorial rotational velocities are proportional to their space velocity
and 3) between 20% and 40% of the runaways have neutron star companions but
less than 1% are visible as radio pulsars in part of the orbit.

Cloud, have revealed spatial power spectra of the intensity, which are quite
similar in shape to those previously deduced for the Galaxy. The similarity, in
spite the differences in the physical parameters between the Galaxy and the
SMC, suggests that the shape of the power spectra reflects some underlying
mechanism which is not too sensitive to the environmental specifics. In this
paper we present an interpretation for the observational power spectra in terms
of a large scale turbulence in the interstellar medium, in which the emitting
H$_I$ regions are embedded. The turbulence gives rise to density fluctuations
which lead to the observed intensity fluctuations, in the H$_I$ regions. The
observational power spectra are used to deduce the turbulence spectral
function.
  In the SMC, the turbulence largest eddies are comparable in scale to the SMC
itself. This implies that turbulent mixing should have smoothed out any large
scale abundance gradients. Indeed, this seems to be the case, observationally.
  The turbulence is also expected to amplify and shape up the large scale
magnetic field. Indeed, the observational data indicate the existence of a
large scale disordered field of the strength expected from energy equilibrium
with the turbulent velocity field. The large scale turbulence is most probably
generated by instabilities in the large scale flows induced by the tidal close
encounter with the LMC $ \sim 2\times 10^8{\rm yr}$ ago. The life-time of the
largest eddies is $\sim 4\times 10^8{\rm yr}$ so the turbulence had not yet
enough time to decay and persists even though the energy source is no longer
there.

overlap regions in all five pairs of subgroups (1) and (2), suggesting that
they are a common property in colliding systems. Except for Arp~244, the
'overlap starburst' is usually fainter than the major nuclear starburst in CLO
pairs. Star formation in 'less disturbed systems' is often distributed
throughout the disks of both galaxies with no 'overlap starburst' detected in

that they are in an earlier interaction stage than pairs of the other two
subgroups where the direct disk collisions have probably not yet occurred.

velocity dispersions of the known unresolved binary F stars have been found to
be dramatically smaller than those of the single F stars. This suggests that
the population of these binaries is, in fact, younger than that of the single
stars, which is further supported by the difference in metal abundance: the
binaries turn out to be, on average, more metal rich than the single stars. So,
we conclude that the population of these binaries is indeed {\it younger} than
that of the single F stars. Comparison of the single F stars with the C
binaries (binary candidates identified in Suchkov & McMaster 1999) has shown,
on the other hand, that the latter stars are, on average, {\it older} than the
single F stars. We suggest that the age difference between the single F stars,
known unresolved binaries, and C binaries is associated with the fact that
stellar evolution in a binary systems depends on the binary components mass
ratio and separation, with these parameters being statistically very different
for the known binaries and C binaries (e.g., mostly substellar secondaries in C
binaries versus stellar secondaries in known binaries).
  In general we conclude that the populations of known binaries, C binaries,
and single F stars do not belong to the same statistical ensemble. The
implications of the discovered age difference between these populations along
with the corresponding differences in kinematics and metallicity should be
important not only for understanding the evolution of stars but also for the
history of star formation and the evolution of the local galactic disk.

significant thermal processing, and in this respect Elias 29 resembles the
least evolved luminous protostars, such as NGC 7538 : IRS9. Thus we conclude
that the heating of the envelope of the low mass object Elias 29 is
qualitatively different from that of high mass protostars. This is possibly
related to a different density gradient of the envelope or shielding of the

component, ~1/4 of an orbit out of phase with the emission features, is
discerned. Doppler tomograms of the double-peaked profiles are consistent with
a disk-wind geometry, rotating at velocities of 1000 km/s. Regrettably, the
tomography algorithm will produce a similar ring structure from alternative
line sources if contaminated by overlying P Cygni profiles. This is certainly
the case in the strong 2.0587 micron HeI line, leading to an ambiguous solution
for the nature of double-peaked emission. The absorption feature, detected 1/4

of these differences. The far-UV spectra require systematically lower stellar
temperatures than previous determinations for O7 supergiants derived from
plane-parallel, hydrostatic models of photospheric line profiles. At these
temperatures, the O VI in Sk -67 111 must be due primarily to shocks in the

Level Set (LS) method is carried out. GB grooving is emerging as a key element
of electromigration drift in polycrystalline microelectronic interconnects, as
evidenced by a number of recent studies. The purpose of the present study is to
provide an efficient numerical simulation, allowing a parametric study of the
effect of key physical parameters (GB and surface diffusivities, grain size,
current density, etc) on the electromigration drift velocity as well as on the
morphology of the affected regions. An idealized polycrystalline interconnect
which consists of grains separated by parallel GBs aligned normal to the
average orientation of interconnect's surface is considered. Surface and
grain-boundary diffusion are the only diffusion mechanisms assumed. The
diffusion is driven by surface curvature gradients and by an externally applied
electric field. The corresponding mathematical system is an initial boundary
value problem for a two-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi type equation. To solve for
the electrostatic problem at a given time step, a full model based on the
solution of Laplace's equation for the electric potential is employed. The
resulting set of linear algebraic equations (from the finite difference
discretization of the equation) is solved with an effective multigrid iterative
procedure. The details of transient slit and ridge formation processes are
presented and compared with theoretical predictions on steady-state grooving.

amplitudes of the electric (or acoustic) field the nonlinear corrections to the
relaxational absorption appear anomalously large. The physical reason for such
behavior is that the nonlinear contribution is dominated by a small group of
close impurity pairs having one electron per pair. Since the group is small, it
is strongly influenced by the field. An external magnetic field strongly
influences the absorption by changing the overlap between the pair components'
wave functions. It is important that the influence is substantially different
for the linear and nonlinear contributions. This property provides an
additional tool to extract nonlinear effects.

corresponding tensor-product generating function, we describe a more powerful
approach which starts by first defining the set of fusion elementary couplings
from a natural extension of the set of tensor-product elementary couplings. A
set of inequalities involving the level are derived from this set using Farkas'
lemma. These inequalities, taken in conjunction with the inequalities defining
the tensor products, define what we call the fusion basis. Given this basis,
the machinery of our previous paper may be applied to construct the fusion

  This note is divided into two parts. The first part deals with symmetric
first order systems on the line in the most general setting. Such a symmetric
first order system of differential equations gives rise naturally to a
symmetric linear relation in a Hilbert space. In this case even regularity is
nontrivial. We will announce a regularity result and discuss criteria for
essential self-adjointness of such systems. This part is based on joint work
with Mark Malamud. Details will be published elsewhere.
  In the second part we consider a complete Riemannian manifold, $M$, and a
first order differential operator, $D:\cinfz{E}\to \cinfz{F}$, acting between
sections of the hermitian vector bundles $E,F$. Moreover, let $V:\cinf{E}\to

influence of a transverse magnetic field is theoretically investigated. We have
generalized the Dielectric Breakdown Model (DBM) for the case of external
magnetic field. Concept of the Magnetic Fractal Dimensionality (MFD) is
introduced and its universality is demonstrated. It is shown that MFD saturates
with magnetic fields. The magnetic field dependence of the streamer curvature
is obtained. It is conjectured that nonlinear current interaction is
responsible for the experimentally observed 'spider-legs' like streamer
patterns.

state cooling by exploiting quantum interference in a driven Lambda-shaped
arrangement of atomic levels. The scheme is technically simpler than existing
methods of sideband cooling, yet it can be significantly more efficient, in
particular when several motional modes are involved, and it does not impose
restrictions on the transition linewidth. We study the full quantum mechanical
model of the cooling process for one motional degree of freedom and show that a
rate equation provides a good approximation.

"quant-ph/0005010","David Marcus Appleby","D.M. Appleby","Contextuality of Approximate Measurements","AMS-Latex, 22 pages. A few typos and other minor corrections, plus
  one additional reference",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The claim of Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) that finite precision measurement
nullifies the Kochen-Specker theorem is criticised. It is argued that, although
MKC have nullified the Kochen-Specker theorem strictly so-called, there are
other, related propositions which are not nullified. The argument given is an
elaboration of some of Mermin's critical remarks. Although MKC allow for the
fact that the observables to be measured cannot be precisely specified, they
continue to assume that the observables which are actually measured are
strictly commuting. As Mermin points out, this assumption is unjustified.
Consequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs
to investigate the predictions their models make regarding approximate joint
measurements of non-commuting observables. Such an investigation is carried
out, using methods previously developed in connection with approximate joint
measurements of position and momentum. It is shown that a form of contextuality
then re-emerges.

atomic populations induced by the interaction of ultracold two-level atoms with
electromagnetic cavities in resonance with an $m$-photon transition of the
atoms ($m$-photon mazer). In particular, sech$^2$ and gaussian cavity mode
profiles are considered and differences in the collapse-revival patterns are
reported. The quantum theory of the $m$-photon mazer is written in the
framework of the dressed-state coordinate formalism. Simple expressions for the
atomic populations, the cavity photon statistics, and the reflection and
transmission probabilities are given for any initial state of the atom-field
system. Evidence for the population trapping phenomenon which suppress the
collapse-revivals in the $m$-photon mazer is given.
