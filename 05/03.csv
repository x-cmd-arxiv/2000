will be apparent in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky. With their
sensitive all-sky observation, MAP and Planck satellites should be able to
detect weak non-Gaussianity in the CMB sky. On large angular scale, there is a
simple relationship between the CMB temperature and the primordial curvature
perturbation. On smaller scales; however, the radiation transfer function
becomes more complex. In this paper, we present the angular bispectrum of the
primary CMB anisotropy that uses the full transfer function. We find that the
bispectrum has a series of acoustic peaks that change a sign, and a period of
acoustic oscillations is twice as long as that of the angular power spectrum.
Using a single non-linear coupling parameter to characterize the amplitude of
the bispectrum, we estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for COBE, MAP,
and Planck experiments. We find that the detection of the primary bispectrum by
any kind of experiments should be problematic for the simple slow-roll
inflationary scenarios. We compare the sensitivity of the primary bispectrum to
the primary skewness and conclude that when we can compute the predicted form
of the bispectrum, it becomes a ``matched filter'' for detecting the
non-Gaussianity in the data, and much more powerful tool than the skewness. We
also show that MAP and Planck can separate the primary bispectrum from various
secondary bispectra on the basis of the shape difference. The primary CMB
bispectrum is a test of the inflationary scenario, and also a probe of the
non-linear physics in the very early universe.

  With decreasing metallicity Z and increasing mass, progenitors tend to
explode as compact Blue Supergiants (BSG) and produce subluminous supernovae
which are about 1.5 mag. dimmer compared to 'normal' SNeII with Red Supergiant
(RSG) progenitors. Progenitors with small masses tend to explode as RSGs even
with low Z. The consequences are obvious for probing the chemical evolution.
  We identify 'extreme SNe IIp' supernovae as a rather homogeneous class which
may allow their use as standard candles for distance determination accurate
within 30 %. Due to their unique light curves, no spectra need to be taken for
their identification, and follow-up observations can be limited to a very small
dynamical range in brightness. This means that distance determination by
'extreme SNe IIp"" are possible up to redshifts of about 3 using 8-meter class
telescopes. SIRTIF may push the limit by another magnitude.

  In the solar vicinity, the increase of C/O with metallicity is due to massive
stars alone. Models with yields by Maeder (1992) or by Portinari, Chiosi, &

of the O VI mid-plane density, n0 = 2x10^(-8) cm^(-3), from the Copernicus

2.7+/-0.4 kpc. We find that N(C IV)/N(O VI) ranges from 0.15 in the disk to 0.6

from the disk to the halo is consistent with a systematic decrease in the scale
heights of Si IV, C IV, N V, to O VI from ~5.1 to ~2.7 kpc. While conductive
heating models can account for the highly ionized atoms at low |z|, a
combination of models (and processes) appears to be required to explain the

index intermediate between that of younger (1 to 5 Myr) T Tauri stars in Cha

the older PTTS in ScoCen compared to the younger classical and WTTS in Cha can
be attributed to a deficiency of smaller size (0.1 to 1mu) dust grains relative
to larger size (~5mu) dust grains in the disks of the PTTS. The lack of small
dust grains is either due to the environment (effect of nearby O stars and
supernova explosions) or due to disk evolution. If the latter is the case, it
would hint that circumstellar disks start to get dust depleted at an age
between 5 to 15 Myr. Dust depletion is very likely related to the build-up of

H-alpha and [NII] HST images reveal striking bipolar shell features, 1 kpc in
projected length from end-to-end, which are likely the result of an outflow
from the nuclear region experiencing a strong interaction with the ISM. While
these outflow shells share similarities with those in some other starburst or
AGN galaxies, these in NGC 4438 are notable because NGC 4438 harbors neither a
luminous circumnuclear starburst nor a luminous AGN. The shells appear to be
closed at their outer ends, suggesting that the outflow in NGC 4438 is
dynamically younger than those in some other galaxies. The radio continuum
emission is strongly enhanced near the outer ends of the shells, suggesting
working surfaces arising from collimated nuclear outflows which have impacted
and shocked the surrounding ISM. The 2 shells are quite different, as the
northwestern (NW) shell is luminous and compact, while the southeastern (SE)
shell is 2.5 times longer and much fainter, in both optical emission lines and
the non-thermal radio continuum. The differences between the 2 shells may be
attributed to a difference in ISM density on the 2 sides of the nuclear disk.
Such an ISM asymmetry exists on larger scales in this heavily disturbed galaxy.

reddening is quit high, particularly in the NE nucleus. All the derived
equivalent widths of the H(alpha)+[N II] lines indicate enhanced star formation

width corresponding to the integrated spectrum reflects starburst activity in

N-body disks in fixed external halo fields are simulated, so that bars are
formed via dynamical instability. In the subsequent evolution, the bars in
prolate halos dissolve gradually with time, while the bar pattern in a
spherical halo remains almost unchanged to the end of the simulation. The decay
times of the bars suggest that they can be destroyed in a time smaller than a
Hubble time. Our results indicate that this dissolution process could occur in
real barred galaxies, if they are surrounded by massive dark prolate halos, and
the configuration adopted here is not unusual from the viewpoint of galaxy
formation. For a prolate halo model, an additional simulation that is
restricted to two-dimensional in-plane motions has also ended up with similar

of minimum stellar Li depletion,and thus to follow the Galactic IS Li
abundance.The most striking feature of this envelope is its steep rise between
Fe/H ~ -0.4 and -0.2,corresponding to a relatively late epoch.The Li abundance
increases by an order of magnitude,from its halo value of logLi ~2.2 to the
""current"" value of ~3.2 within this narrow range of Fe abundances.It is well
known that spallation reactions between CNO and 4He in the ISM produce Li,but
models give a nearly tenfold shortfall for this process.The alpha+alpha fusion
reaction appeared to yield too much early Li or too little current Li.These
failures led to the exploration of stellar sources:supernovae,novae,and the He
flash phase in AGB stars.The Li-Fe envelope is a strong constraint on any
process.Our models can account for this in the context of disk chemical
evolution with a near constant or growing rate of low metallicity gas
infall,and a purely interstellar Li source: alpha-alpha fusion.The Li
production rate is found to be proportional to the gas expulsion rate from
intermediate and low mass stars.Low-energy alphas,emitted by these stars,but
accelerated in more energetic processes associated with SNe,or the bow-shocks
of stellar winds,can yield the observed abundance and its variation with Fe or

approximately describe the distributions. A trend toward flatter distributions
for later-type stars is suggested in our sample. Assuming that the power laws
continue below the detection limit, we have estimated that the superposition of
flares with radiated energies of about $10^{29}-10^{31}$ergs could explain the
observed radiative power loss of these coronae, while the detected flares are
contributing only $\approx 10$%. While the power-law index is not correlated
with rotation parameters (rotation period, projected rotational velocity,
Rossby number) and only marginally with the X-ray luminosity, the flare
occurrence rate is correlated with all of them. The occurrence rate of flares
with energies larger than $10^{32}$ergs is found to be proportional to the
average total stellar X-ray luminosity. Thus, energetic flares occur more often
in X-ray bright stars than in X-ray faint stars. The normalized occurrence rate
of flares with energies larger than $10^{32}$ergs increases with increasing
\lxlbol and stays constant for saturated stars. A similar saturation is found
below a critical Rossby number. The findings are discussed in terms of simple
statistical flare models in an attempt to explain the previously observed trend
for higher average coronal temperatures in more active stars. It is concluded
that flares can contribute a significant amount of energy to coronal heating in

given period, then applying a kick. Our main finding is the following stability
phenomenon: the kicked system often inherits recurrence properties of the
original flow. We present three main examples. 1) G is the torus. We show that
for generic linear flows, and any sequence of kicks, the trajectories of the
kicked system are uniformly distributed for almost all periods. 2) G is a
discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R) acting on the unit tangent bundle of a Riemann
surface. The flow is generated by a single element of G, and we take any
bounded sequence of elements of G as our kicks. We prove that the kicked system
is mixing for all sufficiently large periods if and only if the generator is of
infinite order and is not conjugate to its inverse in G. 3) G is the group of
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold. We assume that the
flow is rapidly growing in the sense of Hofer's norm, and the kicks are
bounded. We prove that for a positive proportion of the periods the kicked
system inherits a kind of energy conservation law and is thus superrecurrent.

energies and residual short-range inter-qubit couplings. It is shown that in
the limit where the fluctuations and couplings are small compared to one-qubit
energy spacing the spectrum has a band structure and a renormalized Hamiltonian
is obtained which describes the eigenstate properties inside one band. The
studies are concentrated on the central band of the computer (``core'') with
the highest density of states. We show that above a critical inter-qubit
coupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of the
computer eigenstates. In this regime the ideal qubit structure disappears, the
eigenstates become complex and the operability of the computer is quickly
destroyed. We confirm that the quantum chaos border decreases only linearly
with the number of qubits n, although the spacing between multi-qubit states
drops exponentially with n. The investigation of time-evolution in the quantum
computer shows that in the quantum chaos regime, an ideal (noninteracting)
state quickly disappears and exponentially many states become mixed after a
short chaotic time scale for which the dependence on system parameters is
determined. Below the quantum chaos border an ideal state can survive for long
times and be used for computation. The results show that a broad parameter
region does exist where the efficient operation of a quantum computer is

formulated on a plane non-commutative geometry endowed with a Galilean symmetry
group in which the position and linear momentum-variable commutators are first
order in the dynamical variables (and thus constitute a true Lie algebra) is
incompatible with the hypothesis of spacial isotropy.
