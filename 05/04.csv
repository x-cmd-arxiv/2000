continuum-fitting. We advocate the technique of trend-removal in place of
traditional continuum-fitting -- here, a spectrum is normalized by its
(smoothly varying) mean rather than its continuum -- this method is easily
automated and removes biases introduced by continuum-fitting. Trend- removal
can be easily applied to spectra where continuum-fitting is difficult, such as
when the resolution or signal-to-noise is low, or for spectra at high
redshifts. Furthermore, a measurement of the continuum power spectrum using
trend-removal, from either low redshift quasar spectra or the red-side of
Lyman-alpha, allows in principle the removal of spurious power introduced by
the continuum and thereby expanding scales probed to larger ones. We also
derive expressions for the shot-noise bias and variance of the power spectrum
estimate, taking into account the non-Poissonian nature of the shot-noise and
the non-Gaussianity of the cosmic fluctuations. An appropriate minimum variance
weighting of the data is given. Finally, we give practical suggestions on
observing strategy: the desired resolution and S/N for different purposes, and
how to distribute one's finite observing time among quasar targets. Also
discussed is the quasar spectroscopic study of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,

were randomly culled to produce homogeneously selected samples. We then studied
the relationship between the cumulative area covered by voids and the void size
as a property of the void hierarchy. We find that the distribution of void
sizes scales with the mean galaxy separation, $\lambda$. In particular, we find
that the size of voids covering half of the area is given by $D_{med} \approx
\lambda + (12\pm3) \h^{-2}$Mpc. Next, by employing an environmental density
threshold criterion to identify mock galaxies, we were able to extend this
analysis to mock samples from dynamical $n$-body simulations of Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) models. To reproduce the observed void statistics, overdensity
thresholds of $\delta_{th} \approx 0 ... 1$ are necessary. We have compared
standard (SCDM), open (OCDM), vacuum energy dominated ($\Lambda$CDM), and
broken scale invariant CDM models (BCDM): we find that both the void coverage
distribution and the two-point correlation function provide important and
complementary information on the large-scale matter distribution. The
dependence of the void statistics on the threshold criterion for the mock
galaxy indentification shows that the galaxy biasing is more crucial for the
void size distribution than are differences between the cosmological models.

background, I found that the detection rate (one per 54 GRBs observed by the

of this GRB at z \sim 0.7 and the isotropic total energy in the TeV range,

interestingly similar to the maximum total GRB energy observed to date, in the

scattering of relativistic electrons. Recent studies of upscattering and energy
loss by relativistic electrons that have used the non-relativistic, magnetic
Thomson cross section for resonant scattering or the Klein-Nishina cross
section for non-resonant scattering do not account for the relativistic quantum
effects of strong fields ($ > 4 \times 10^{12}$ G). We have derived a
simplified expression for the exact QED scattering cross section for the
broadly-applicable case where relativistic electrons move along the magnetic
field. To facilitate applications to astrophysical models, we have also
developed compact approximate expressions for both the differential and total
polarization-dependent cross sections, with the latter representing well the
exact total QED cross section even at the high fields believed to be present in
environments near the stellar surfaces of Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters and
Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars. We find that strong magnetic fields significantly
lower the Compton scattering cross section below and at the resonance, when the
incident photon energy exceeds $m_ec^2$ in the electron rest frame. The cross
section is strongly dependent on the polarization of the final scattered
photon. Below the cyclotron fundamental, mostly photons of perpendicular
polarization are produced in scatterings, a situation that also arises above
this resonance for sub-critical fields. However, an interesting discovery is
that for super-critical fields, a preponderance of photons of parallel
polarization results from scatterings above the cyclotron fundamental. This
characteristic is both a relativistic and magnetic effect not present in the
Thomson or Klein-Nishina limits.

later phase is dominated both by the irradiated ACDK and by the irradiated RG
underfilling the inner critical Roche lobe. The UV light curve is also well

envelope mass at the optical peak is estimated to be 2 x 10^{-6} M_sun,

early-type spiral sample has a wider range of the present star formation rate
(SFR) than the late-type sample. This tendency is understood in the framework
of the limit-cycle model of the interstellar medium (ISM), in which the SFR
cyclically changes in accordance with the temporal variation of the mass
fraction of the three ISM components. When the limit-cycle model of the ISM is
applied, the amplitude of variation of the SFR is expected to change with the
supernova (SN) rate. Observational evidence indicates that the early-type
spiral galaxies show smaller rates of present SN than late-type ones. Combining
this evidence with the limit-cycle model of the ISM, we predict that the
early-type spiral galaxies show larger amplitudes in their SFR variation than
the late-types. Indeed, this prediction is consistent with the observed wider
range of the SFR in the early-type sample than in the late-type sample. Thus,
in the framework of the limit-cycle model of the ISM, we are able to interpret
the difference in the amplitude of SFR variation among the morphological
classes of spiral galaxies.

voltage dependent energy difference $\Delta$. This energy difference is
compared with the activation temperature T_a extracted from the experimentally

k_B T_a which lends support to the idea that the conductance anomaly is due to
transmission through two conduction channels, of which the one with its subband

domains can be distinguished. First there is an increase on the ps-scale due to
the vibrational (ballistic) motion of the atoms. This is followed, on an
intermediate time-scale, by a growth, due to local relaxations
(beta-relaxation) at not too high temperatures. A maximum is reached at times
corresponding to long range diffusion (alpha-relaxation). At long times the
non-Gaussianity slowly drops, the system becoming homogeneous on these
time-scales. In both systems studied, the non-Gaussianity follows in the
intermediate time domain, corresponding to the beta-relaxations, a law ~ t^1/2.
This general behavior is explained by collective hopping and dynamic
heterogeneity. We support this finding by a model calculation.

interactions. The first method is quite general and it is based on the
numerical evaluation of the density of states with a given energy. The second
method is more specific for Tsallis thermostatistics and it is based on a

superpositions of the modes are constructed, and the quantum bohmian
trajectories are determined in the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie

but with a characteristic scale of the order of the Planck scale. Bouncing
regular solutions emerge for the flat curvature case. They contract classically
from infinity until a minimum size, where quantum effects become important
acting as repulsive forces avoiding the singularity and creating an
inflationary phase, expanding afterwards to an infinite size, approaching the
classical expansion as long as the scale factor increases. These are
non-singular solutions which are viable models to describe the early Universe.

is found to soften to an increase of slightly less than quadratic when averaged
over the plane of the collider ring and slightly less than linear for the

Despite this, the numerical values are judged to be sufficiently high that any

specifically chosen to minimize or eliminate human exposure to the neutrino
radiation. It is pointed out that such sites would be of an appropriate size
scale to also house future proton-proton and electron-positron colliders at the

with the collider physics. Except at the very highest energy muon colliders,
the main thrust of the neutrino physics program would be to improve on the
measurements from preceding neutrino experiments at lower energy muon
colliders, particularly in the fields of B physics, quark mixing and CP
violation. Muon colliders at the 10 TeV energy scale might already produce of
order 10^8 B hadrons per year in a favorable and unique enough experimental
environment to have some analytical capabilities beyond any of the currently
operating or proposed B factories. The most important of the quark mixing
measurements at these energies might well be the improved measurements of the
important CKM matrix elements |V_ub| and |V_cb| and, possibly, the first
measurements of |V_td| in the process of flavor changing neutral current
interactions involving a top quark loop. Muon colliders at the highest
center-of-mass energies that have been conjectured, 100--1000 TeV, would
produce neutrino beams for neutrino-nucleon interaction experiments with
maximum center-of-mass energies from 300--1000 GeV. Such energies are
comparable to the 314 GeV center-of-mass energy for electron-proton scattering
at the HERA collider, but the luminosity would would be several orders of
magnitude larger. This would potentially open up the possibility for high
statistics studies of any exotic particles, such as leptoquarks, that might
have been previously discovered at these energy scales.

exceed 1 event/kg/day for a $^{73}$Ge detector, for low values of GUT scale

leptons. The proton is naturally stable due to intrinsic discrete symmetries of
the corresponding string theory. In particular R-parity appears as a natural
stringy symmetry. There are axionic fields with the right couplings as to solve
the strong CP problem. Similar realizations are also presented for a string
scale of 1 TeV, although without solving the gauge unification problem. Open
questions are briefly discussed.

an off-critical model, the affine Toda model coupled to the matter (ATM). The
quantum version of this reduction process is discussed by means of the
perturbative Lagrangian viewpoint, showing that the ATM theory is a
spontaneously broken and reduced version of the CATM model. We show, using
bosonization techniques that the off-critical theory decouples into a

we construct the explicit forms of the one and two-soliton classical solutions,

sine- Gordon (massive Thirring) solitons, and satisfy the classical equivalence
of topological and Noether currents in the ATM model. Imposing the Noether and
topological currents equivalence as a constraint, one can show that the ATM
model leads to a bag model like mechanism for the confinement of the U(1)

multivalued and work for any dimensionality. Nayak and Wilczek proposed a
Clifford statistics for the fractional quantum Hall effect. We apply them to
toy quanta here. A complex-Clifford example has the energy spectrum of a system
of spin-1/2 particles in an external magnetic field. This supports the proposal

showed that the smallest noncyclic odd-order group that can be embedded in a
division ring is one of order 63 (and this group is unique).
  Amitsur's paper is daunting to read as it is long and technically
complicated. In lecturing to a graduate class on division rings, I tried to
find a simple reason for the ``first exceptional odd order'' 63 (to Herstein's
conjecture). After some work, I did come up with a reason that was simple
enough to be explained to my class, without having to go through any part of
Amitsur's paper. Furthermore, the method I used led easily to the second
exceptional odd order, 117 (which was not mentioned in Amitsur's paper). Since
this line of reasoning did not seem to have appeared in the literature before,
I record it in this short note. To better motivate the results discussed here,
I have also included a quick exposition on the beginning part of the theory of
finite subgroups of division rings.

microtubules has been criticized as regards the issue of environmental
decoherence. A recent report by Tegmark finds that microtubules can maintain
quantum coherence for only $10^{-13}$ s, far too short to be
neurophysiologically relevant. Here, we critically examine the assumptions
behind Tegmark's calculation and find that: 1) Tegmark's commentary is not
aimed at an existing model in the literature but rather at a hybrid that
replaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch OR' theory with a
soliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts decreasing
decoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the observed
behavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark's
equation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR' model
(superposition separation, charge vs. dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens
the decoherence time to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical
assumption of Tegmark's derivation, 4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to
the collective dynamics ordering water in the vicinity of microtubules at a
rate exceeding that of decoherence can counter decoherence effects (in the same
way that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature), and 5) phases of actin
gelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule bundles, further
increasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and the
decoherence time to $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ s. These revisions bring microtubule
decoherence into a regime in which quantum gravity can interact with
neurophysiology.
