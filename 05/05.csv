observed with the ISOCAM instrument aboard the Infrared Space Observatory. Many
of the general features of galaxies observed at optical wavelengths---spiral
arms, disks, rings, and bright knots of emission---are also seen in the
mid-infrared, except the prominent optical bulges are absent at 6.75 and 15
microns. In addition, the maps are quite similar at 6.75 and 15 microns, except
for a few cases where a central starburst leads to lower 6.75/15 ratios in the
inner region. We also present infrared flux densities and mid-infrared sizes
for these galaxies. The mid-infrared color 6.75/15 shows a distinct trend with
the far-infrared color 60/100. The quiescent galaxies in our sample (60/100 <
0.6) show 6.75/15 near unity, whereas this ratio drops significantly for
galaxies with higher global heating intensity levels. Azimuthally-averaged
surface brightness profiles indicate the extent to which the mid-infrared flux
is centrally concentrated, and provide information on the radial dependence of
mid-infrared colors. The galaxies are mostly well resolved in these maps:
almost half of them have < 10% of their flux in the central resolution element.
A comparison of optical and mid-infrared isophotal profiles indicates that the
optical flux at 4400 Angstroms near the optical outskirts of the galaxies is
approximately eight (seven) times that at 6.75 microns (15 microns), comparable
with observations of the diffuse quiescent regions of the Milky Way.

the interstellar medium in the system relative to the jet may have produced
sufficient ram pressure to bend the radio jet. An alternative hypothesis is
that the jet was distorted by ram pressure due to an intracluster medium,
although the small radial velocity of NGC 4410A relative to the group and the
lack of diffuse X-ray emission in the group makes this less likely unless the

Observations reveal smooth halos with central density cores. One possible
resolution of this conflict is that the dark matter is warm (WDM); this will
suppress the power spectrum on small scales. The Lyman-alpha forest is a
powerful probe of the linear power spectrum on these scales. We use
collisionless N-body simulations to follow the evolution of structure in WDM
models, and analyze artificial Lyman-alpha forest spectra extracted from them.
By requiring that there is enough small-scale power in the linear power
spectrum to reproduce the observed properties of the Lyman-alpha forest in
quasar spectra, we derive a lower limit to the mass of the WDM particle of 750
eV. This limit is robust to reasonable uncertainties in our assumption about
the temperature of the mean density gas (T0) at z=3. We argue that any model
that suppresses the CDM linear theory power spectrum more severely than a 750

the influence of signal composition and of acquisition parameters on the

The best performing compressor tested up to now is the arithmetic compression
of order 1, designed for optimizing the compression of white noise like
signals, which allows an overall compression rate <Cr> = 2.65 +/- 0.02. We find
that such result is not improved by other lossless compressors, being the
signal almost white noise dominated. Lossless compression algorithms alone will
not solve the bandwidth problem but needs to be combined with other techniques.

accretion disc are presented. The model is based on the alpha-viscosity,
includes self-gravity, convective transport and turbulent pressure. A few
properties of the model are discussed for circumstellar and AGN discs.
  We show the strong sensitivity of the disc structure to the viscous energy
deposition towards the vertical axis, specially when entering inside the
self-gravitating part of the disc. The local version of the alpha-prescription
leads to a ""singular"" behavior which is also predicted by the vertically
averaged model. With respect, a much softer transition is observed with the
  ""alpha-P"" formalism. Turbulent pressure is important only for alpha > 0.1. It
lowers vertical density gradients, significantly thickens the disc, tends to
wash out density inversions and pushes the self-gravitating region to slightly
larger radii. Curves localizing the inner edge of the self-gravitating disc as
functions of the viscosity parameter and accretion rate are given. The lower
alpha, the closer to the center the self-gravitating regime, and the
sensitivity to the accretion rate is generally weak, except for alpha < 0.1.
This study suggests that models aiming to describe T-Tauri discs beyond about a
few to a few tens astronomical units from the central protostar using the
alpha-theory should consider vertical self-gravity. The Primitive Solar Nebula
was probably a bit (if not strongly) self-gravitating at the actual orbit of
giant planets. Alpha-discs hosted by active galaxies are self-gravitating
beyond about a thousand Schwarzchild radii. The inferred surface density
remains too high to lower the accretion time scale. More efficient mechanisms

galaxies, based on the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code of Bianchi, Ferrara
& Giovanardi (1996). The radiative transfer is carried out at several
wavelength in the Ultraviolet, optical and Near Infrared, to cover the range of
the stellar Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). Together with the images of the
galactic model, a map of the energy absorbed by dust is produced. Using
Galactic dust properties, the spatial distribution of dust temperature is
derived under the assumption of thermal equilibrium. A correction is applied
for non-equilibrium emission in the Mid Infrared. Images of dust emission can
then be produced at any wavelength in the FIR.
  We show the application of the model to the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. The
observed stellar SED is used as input and models are produced for different
star-dust geometries. It is found that only optically thick dust disks can
reproduce the observed amount of FIR radiation. However, it is not possible to
reproduce the large FIR scalelength suggested by recent observation of spirals
at 200 um, even when the scalelength of the dust disk is larger than that for
stars. Optically thin models have ratios of optical/FIR scalelengths closer to
the 200um observations, but with smaller absolute scalelengths than optically
thick cases. The modelled temperature distributions are compatible with
observations of the Galaxy and other spirals. We finally discuss the
approximations of the model and the impact of a clumpy stellar and dust
structure on the FIR simulations.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/319439",,"astro-ph",,"  We present two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations in
spherical polar coordinates of a Type Ia supernova interacting with a constant
density interstellar medium. The ejecta are assumed to be freely expanding with
an exponential density profile. The interaction gives rise to a double-shocked
structure susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities. The Rayleigh-Taylor
instability initially grows, but the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability takes over,
producing vortex rings. The nonlinear instability initially evolves toward
longer wavelengths and eventually fades away when the reverse shock front is in
the flatter part of the supernova density distribution. Based on observations
of X-ray knots and the protrusion in the southeast outlin of Tycho's supernova
remnant, we include clumping in the ejecta. The clump interaction with the
reverse shock induces Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities on the
clump surface that facilitate fragmentation. In order to survive crushing and
to have a bulging effect on the forward shock, the clump's initial density
ratio to the surrounding ejecta must be at least 100 for the conditions in
Tycho's remnant. The 56Ni bubble effect may be important for the development of
clumpiness in the ejecta. The observed presence of an Fe clump would then
require a non-radioactive origin for this Fe, possibly 54Fe. The large radial
distance of the X-ray emitting Si and S ejecta from the remnant center
indicates that they were initially in clumps.

shown to be a typical feature of infinitely long wires at weak magnetic fields:
The far tail of the wave functions decays twice as slow as their main body.

qualitative description of the crossover in the magnetic field. Our arguments
can be used for any dimensionality indicating that the concept of the two-scale
localization in a weak magnetic field is a general feature of localization. The

matrices; all of which are graded, in that they solve a graded Yang-Baxter
equation. This grading is easily removed, yielding R matrices that solve the
usual Yang-Baxter equation. For m>2, the computations are impracticable for a
human to perform, so we have implemented the entire process in Mathematica, and
then performed the computations for m=1,2,3 and 4.

logical form of thinking is considered. In this paper we will investigate
exactly that: we will conjecture on the origin of basic instruments of logical
thinking.
  As the starting point we consider a very general case of a subject
interacting with an environment. The subject might often have a choice of
actions to take. Additionally, it is of fundamental importance that as a rule
the subject's internal representations of (beliefs about) the environment are
inaccurate.
  Beginning with this very general schema we will eventually arrive at a
possible mechanism of how Logic could have emerged. Our reasoning will be
supported with some in-depth case studies.

astrophysical energies is an unsolved problem of great importance to
astrophysics. That effect is modeled here by considering the fusion of
hydrogen-like atoms whose electron probability density is used in Poisson's
equation in order to derive the corresponding screened Coulomb potential
energy. That way atomic excitations and deformations of the fusing atoms can be
taken into account. Those potentials are then treated semiclassically in order
to obtain the screening (accelerating) factor of the reaction. By means of the
proposed model the effect of a superstrong magnetic field on laboratory
Hydrogen fusion reactions is investigated here for the first time showing that,
despite the considerable increase in the cross section of the $% dd$ reaction,
the $pp$ reaction is still too slow to justify experimentation. The proposed
model is finally applied on the $H^{2}(d,p) H^{3}$ fusion reaction describing
satisfactorily the experimental data although some ambiguity remains regarding
the molecular nature of the deuteron target. Notably, the present method gives
a sufficiently high screening energy for Hydrogen fusion reactions so that the
take-away energy of the spectator nucleus can also be taken into account.

its gravitational radius due to the strong gravitational time dilation effects.
The such ""topological"" difference between the Newtonian and relativistic
gravity leads to the known observable effects. The hierarchy of supercompact
stars, more massive than neutron stars, such as heavy baryon, quark (subquark?)
and other heavy particle stars is predicted instead of the black holes. The
lack of the cosmological singularity and a gravitational nature of the
regularizations of loop divergencies in quantum field theory are also
discussed.

effect, allowing us to achieve BEC where standard 1-frequency-RF-knife

cooling, provided that the residual detuning between the transition and the RF

as the product of elements respectively in the left and right ideals of an

two representation independent algebraic forms in terms of the density and
phase operators. These forms are respectively the continuity equation, which
involves the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the density operator, and an
equation for the time development of the phase operator that involves the
anti-commutator of the Hamiltonian with this density operator. We show that
this latter equation plays two important roles: (i) it expresses the
conservation of energy in a system where energy is well defined and (ii) it
provides a simple way to evaluate the gauge changes that occur in the
Aharonov-Bohm, the Aharonov-Casher, and Berry phase effects. Both these
operator (i.e. purely algebraic) equations also allow us to re-examine the Bohm
interpretation, showing that it is in fact possible to construct Bohm
interpretations in representations other than the x-representation. We discuss
the meaning of the Bohm interpretation in the light of these new results in
terms of non-commutative structures and this enables us to clarify its relation
to standard quantum mechanics.
