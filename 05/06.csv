  and Astrophysics (Institute of Physics Publishing)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  About half a million years after the Big Bang, the ever-fading cosmic
blackbody radiation cooled below 3000 K and shifted first into the infrared and
then into the radio, and the smooth baryonic plasma that filled the Universe
became neutral. The Universe then entered a ``dark age'' which persisted until
the first cosmic structures collapsed into gravitationally-bound systems, and
evolved into stars, galaxies, and black holes that lit up the Universe again.
Some time between redshift of 7 and 15, stars within protogalaxies created the
first heavy elements; these systems, together perhaps with an early population
of quasars, generated the ultraviolet radiation that reheated and reionized the
cosmos. The history of the Universe during and soon after these crucial
formative stages is recorded in the all-pervading intergalactic medium (IGM),
which is believed to contain most of the ordinary baryonic material left over
from the Big Bang. Throughout the epoch of structure formation, the IGM becomes
clumpy and acquires peculiar motions under the influence of gravity, and acts
as a source for the gas that gets accreted, cools, and forms stars within
galaxies, and as a sink for the metal enriched material, energy, and radiation
which they eject. Observations of absorption lines in quasar spectra at
redshifts up to 5 provide invaluable insight into the chemical composition of
the IGM and primordial density fluctuation spectrum of some of the earliest
formed cosmological structures, as well as of the ultraviolet background
radiation that ionizes them.

The model is a generalization of the so-called 'affine' stellar model. In our
model the star is composed of elliptical shells with different parameters and
different orientations, depending on time and on the radial Lagrangian
coordinate of the shell. The evolution equations of this model are derived from
the virial relations under certain assumptions, and the integrals of motion are
identified. It is shown that the evolution equations can be deduced from a
variational principle. The evolution equations are solved numerically and
compared quantitatively with the results of 3D numerical computations of the
tidal interaction of a star with a supermassive black hole. The comparison
shows very good agreement between the main ``integral'' characteristics
describing the tidal interaction event in our model and in the 3D computations.
Our model is effectively a one-dimensional Lagrangian model from the point of
view of numerical computations, and therefore it can be evolved numerically
$10^{2}-10^{3}$ times faster than the 3D approach allows. This makes our model
well suited for intensive calculations covering the whole parameter space of
the problem.

sense that DIRBE/IRAS reddening values can be substantially larger, suggesting
effects due to the depth distribution of the dust. The differences appear to
arise from dust in the background of the clusters consistent with a dust layer
where important extinction occurs up to distances from the Plane of ~ 300 pc.
For 3 % of the sample a significant background dust contribution might be
explained by higher dust clouds. We find evidence that the Milky Way dust lane

stellar models by Heger, Langer, & Woosley, which covers solar metallicity
stars in the initial mass range 8 - 25 solar masses. Results are parameterized
by initial mass, initial rotational velocity and major uncertainties in the
treatment of the rotational mixing inside massive stars.
  Rotationally induced mixing processes widen the main sequence and increase
the core hydrogen burning lifetime, similar to the effects of convective
overshooting. It can also significantly increase the luminosity during and
after core hydrogen burning, and strongly affects the evolution of the
effective temperature. Our models predict surface rotational velocities for
various evolutionary stages, in particular for blue supergiants, red
supergiants, and for the immediate presupernova stage.
  We discuss the changes of the surface abundances due to rotationally induced
mixing for main sequence and post main sequence stars. We single out two
characteristics by which the effect of rotational mixing can be distinguished
from that of massive close binary mass transfer, the only alternative process
leading to non-standard chemical surface abundances in massive stars. A
comparison with observed abundance anomalies in various types of massive stars
supports the concept of rotational mixing in massive stars and indicates that
it is responsible for most of the observed abundance anomalies.

the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (PL) relation with data from over 700 Cepheids in
the LMC obtained by the OGLE collaboration; we assume an LMC distance modulus
of 18.50 mag (d=50.1 kpc). Using this PL calibration we obtain new distances to
the H0KP galaxies. We correct the redshifts of these galaxies for peculiar
velocities using two distinct velocity field models: the phenomenological model
of Tonry et al. and a model based on the IRAS density field and linear
gravitational instability theory. We combine the Cepheid distances with the
corrected redshifts for the 27 galaxies to derive H_0, the Hubble constant. The
results are H_0 = 85 +/- 5 km/s/Mpc (random error) at 95% confidence when the
IRAS model is used, and 92 +/- 5 km/s/Mpc when the phenomenological model is
used. The IRAS model is a better fit to the data and the Hubble constant it
returns is more reliable. Systematic error stems mainly from LMC distance
uncertainty which is not directly addressed by this paper. Our value of H_0 is
significantly larger than that quoted by the H0KP, H_0 = 71 +/- 6 km/s/Mpc.

author in order to obtain a unified treatment of particles as well as (charged)
infraparticles which do not permit a definition of mass and spin according to
Wigner's theory. Particle weights arise as temporal limits of physical states
in the vacuum sector and describe the asymptotic particle content. Following a
thorough analysis of the underlying notion of localizing operators, we give a
precise definition of this concept and investigate the characteristic
properties. The decomposition of particle weights into pure components which
are linked to irreducible representations of the quasi-local algebra has been a
long-standing desideratum that only recently found its solution. We set out two
approaches to this problem by way of disintegration theory, making use of a
physically motivated assumption concerning the structure of phase space in
quantum field theory. The significance of the pure particle weights ensuing
from this disintegration is founded on the fact that they exhibit features of
improper energy-momentum eigenstates, analogous to Dirac's conception, and
permit a consistent definition of mass and spin even in an infraparticle
situation.

equilibrium. By complementing our model with a time symmetric interaction law,
we are led to a straightforward derivation of the principles underlying the
electromagnetic interaction between two uniformly moving charged particles. An
extension of our theory to the case of particles in arbitrary motion shows that
we have to modify Maxwell's equations of the microscopic electromagnetic field,
in order to accommodate a field-strength tensor which is no longer
antisymmetric. It is further argued that the radiation reaction force gives
another example of a 4-force which is not orthogonal to the 4-velocity, thus
leading to a variable rest mass. The variation of the rest mass is then
discussed from the point of view of the equivalence principle of general

oscillator with time-dependent frequency is developed, and general formulae for
main theoretical quantities are obtained. In particular, the p-adic propagator
is calculated, and the existence of a simple vacuum state as well as adelic
quantum dynamics is shown. Space discreteness and p-adic quantum-mechanical
phase are noted.

  for two qubits","5 pages, 2 pictures, LaTex, two columns; No changes in the results",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4418",,"quant-ph",,"  Tests of local realism vs quantum mechanics based on Bell's inequality employ
two entangled qubits. We investigate the general case of two entangled quNits,
i.e. quantum systems defined in an N-dimensional Hilbert space. Via a numerical
linear optimization method we show that violations of local realism are
stronger for two maximally entangled quNits (N=3,4,...,9), than for two qubits
and that they increase with N. The two quNit measurements can be experimentally
realized using entangled photons and unbiased multiport beamsplitters.

are investigated. An application of the stochastic golden rule shows that in
the stochastic limit the dynamics of such a system is described by a quantum
stochastic differential equation. The corresponding master equation describes
convergence of a system to equilibrium. In particular it predicts exponential
damping for off-diagonal matrix elements of the system density matrix, moreover
these elements for a generic system will decay at least as
\exp(-tN{kT\over\hbar}), where N is a number of particles in the system. As an
application of the described technique a derivation from first principles (i.e.
starting from a Hamiltonian description) of a quantum extension of the Glauber
dynamics for systems of spins is given.
