flares (the flare waiting-time distribution) follows a power law, for long
waiting times. Based on 25 years of soft X-ray flares observed by Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) instruments it is shown that 1. the
waiting-time distribution of flares is consistent with a time-dependent Poisson
process, and 2. the fraction of time the Sun spends with different flaring
rates approximately follows an exponential distribution. The second result is a
new phenomenological law for flares. It is shown analytically how the observed
power-law behavior of the waiting times originates in the exponential
distribution of flaring rates. These results are argued to be consistent with a
non-stationary avalanche model for flares.

seen in all systems and in some cases the extended tidal features (both the
smooth stellar distribution and compact star-forming features) contribute up to
60-80% of the total flux. The star-forming regions in both samples are found to
have ages based on spectral synthesis models in the range 10-100 Myrs, and most
differences in color between them can be attributed to the effects of dust
reddening. Additionally, it is found that star-formation in compact knots in
the tidal tails is most prominent in those ULIGs which have double nuclei,
suggesting that the star-formation rate in the tails peaks prior to the actual
coalescence of the galaxy nuclei and diminishes quickly thereafter. Similar to
results at other wavelengths, the observed star formation at U' can only
account for a small fraction of the known bolometric luminosity of the ULIGs.
Azimuthally averaged radial light profiles at U' are characterized by a sersic
law with index n=2, which is intermediate between an exponential disk and an
r^(-1/4) law and closely resembles the latter at large radii. The implications
of this near-ultraviolet imaging for optical/near-infrared observations of high

ASCA observations are conducted contiguously, so their X-ray variability
properties can be studied systematically. ASCA detectors have a broad band pass
and moderate energy resolution, properties which allow their complex X-ray
spectrum to be deconvolved. ASCA observations have revealed that a soft excess
extending up to 1 keV is frequently found in the X-ray spectra from NLS1s. The
hard X-ray photon index has been shown to be systematically steeper than in
Seyfert 1 galaxies with broad optical lines. NLS1s also exhibit larger
amplitude variability than broad-line Seyferts of similar hard X-ray
luminosity. On occasion, features in the soft X-ray band have been detected
that appear to be specific to NLS1s; ionized iron lines have also been
observed. These results have been fundamental for building our current picture
of the X-ray emission from NLS1s. Many of the properties can be explained if
the specific accretion rate is larger in NLS1s than in Seyfert 1 galaxies with
broad optical lines. NLS1s may exemplify an extreme state of an intrinsic

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Surprisingly, this makes them very useful for
constraining models. I discuss what happens when one attempts to qualitatively
fit the NLS1 phenomenon using the stellar wind model for AGN line emission
(e.g., Kazanas 1989). The simplest way of narrowing profile bases of this model
to the widths observed in NLS1s is probably to lower the mass of the
supermassive black hole. In a flux-limited and redshift-limited data set, this
is indeed similar to increasing L/L_Edd. Because the broad line region (BLR) of
the stellar line emission model scales with the tidal radius of the stars, this
model predicts maximal BLR velocities of FWZI proportional (L/L_Edd)^(-1/3).
This implies that the black holes of NLS1s are approximately 3^3=27 times less
massive than those in other Seyfert 1s if the stellar line emission model is
correct. Another consequence of increasing L/L_Edd in this model is that it
results in an increase in the wind edge densities. NLS1 spectra appear to
support this result as well. Even the collateral features of NLS1s, such as the
line asymmetries and continuum properties, appear to be easily explained within
the context of this model. For better or worse, if the stellar wind line
emission is correct, NLS1s are not much stranger than other AGNs.

Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are due to the steep X-ray continuum is
tested by comparing photoionization model calculations with various observed
properties of Seyfert 1 galaxies. A meaningful comparison must involve the
careful use of the right X-ray ionization parameter, designated here U(oxygen).
When this is done, it is found that the strength of the continuum absorption
features is insensitive to the exact slope of the 0.1-50 keV continuum. It is
also shown that the complex of iron L-shell lines near 1 keV can produce strong
absorption and emission features, depending on the gas distribution and line
widths. While this may explain some unusual X-ray features in AGN, the
predicted intensity of the features do not distinguish NLS1 from broader line
sources. Finally, acceleration of highly ionized gas, by X-ray radiation
pressure, is also not sensitive to the exact slope of the X-ray continuum.

of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051. The rapid continuum variations
observed in the X-ray spectra are not detected in the optical, although the
X-ray and optical continuum fluxes are correlated on time scales of many weeks
and longer. Variations in the flux of the broad H-beta line are found to lag
behind the optical continuum variations by approximately 6 days (with an
uncertainty of 2-3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a
virial mass estimate of about 1.1e6 solar masses, at the very low end of the
distribution of AGN masses measured by line reverberation. Strong variability
of He II lambda 4686 is also detected, and the response time measured is
similar to that of H-beta, but with a much larger uncertainty. The He II lambda
4686 line is almost five times broader than H-beta, and it is strongly blueward
asymmetric, as are the high-ionization UV lines recorded in archive spectra of
NGC 4051. The data are consistent with the Balmer lines arising in a
low-inclination (nearly face-on) disk-like configuration, and the
high-ionization lines arising in an outflowing wind, of which we observe
preferentially the near side. During the third year of monitoring, both the
X-ray continuum and the He II lambda 4686 line went into extremely low states,
although the optical continuum and the H-beta broad line were both still
present and variable. We suggest that the inner part of the accretion disk may
have gone into an advection-dominated state, yielding little radiation from the
hotter inner disk.

rapid X-ray variability, steep X-ray spectra, peculiar optical and UV line

together they are likely to be related to one specific underlying physical
parameter. I review recent evidence, based on HST imaging of low z quasars,
which suggests that the H-beta line width and continuum luminosity of quasars
provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the black hole mass. This implies
that narrow-line AGN have relatively low black hole masses, and thus high
L/L_Edd, as independently suggested based on their steep X-ray spectra. I
present additional evidence suggesting that the X-ray variability and the radio
loudness are primarily driven by the black hole mass. The high mass inflow rate
into the core of narrow-line AGNs may produce a denser and more enriched BLR, a
high column radiation pressure driven outflow, and a smaller illumination angle
for the NLR, as suggested by the observed emission line properties. Narrow-line
AGNs may thus provide important clues for understanding the rich overall
phenomenology of AGNs.

their high Eddington accretion rates. We present some new trends of optical-UV

as weaker CIV lambda 1549 and CIII] lambda 1909 emission. We show that these
line properties are due to a lower ionization parameter and somewhat higher BLR
cloud densities. These modified conditions can be explained by the hotter big
blue bumps observed in NLS1s, which are in turn due to higher L/L_Edd ratios,
as shown by our accretion disk and corona modeling of the NLS1 continua. We
also present evidence that the Boroson & Green eigenvector 1, which is
correlated with the optical and UV emission-line properties, is not driven by
orientation and hence NLS1s, which have extreme eigenvector 1 values, are not
viewed from an extreme viewing angle.

0.1<z<0.25 are derived from very good seeing images taken at the NOT and the La
Silla Danish telescopes. With the purpose of investigating the evolution of the
fraction of different morphological types with redshift, we compare our results
with the morphological content of nine distant clusters studied by the MORPHS
group, five clusters observed with HST-WFPC2 at redshift z = 0.2-0.3, and
Dressler's (1980) large sample of nearby clusters. After having checked the
reliability of our morphological classification both in an absolute sense and
relative to the MORPHS scheme, we analyze the relative occurrence of
elliptical, S0 and spiral galaxies as a function of the cluster properties and
redshift. We find a large intrinsic scatter in the S0/E ratio, mostly related
to the cluster morphology. In particular, in our cluster sample, clusters with
a high concentration of ellipticals display a low S0/E ratio and, vice-versa,
low concentration clusters have a high S0/E. At the same time, the trend of the
morphological fractions and ratios with redshift clearly points to a
morphological evolution: as the redshift decreases, the S0 population tends to
grow at the expense of the spiral population, whereas the frequency of Es
remains almost constant. We also analyze the morphology-density (MD) relation
in our clusters and find that -similarly to higher redshift clusters- a good MD
relation exists in the high-concentration clusters, while it is absent in the
less concentrated clusters. Finally, the comparison of the MD relation in our
clusters with that of the D97 sample suggests that the transformation of
spirals into S0 galaxies becomes more efficient with decreasing local density.

this work. We consider the case of periodical velocity shear with bi-annual
oscillation period . The large-scale magnetic field toroidal and meridional
components are obtained as harmonic functions of the time. The sign reversal of
these magnetic field components is studied. The numerical simulations show
that, due to the velocity shear oscillations, the toroidal or meridional
component of the large-scale magnetic field reverses its sign three times in
one of the hemispheres (northern or southern) of the Sun, during the solar
activity cycle 23. According to our results the appearance of velocity shear
oscillations leads to the modulation of the magnetic field 22-year period
oscillations by the bi-annual ones. The presented model is applicable for
investigation of the magnetic field evolution at the base of convection zone as
well as for understanding the magnetic field properties in the upper solar
atmosphere. The excitement of the linear Rossby and Alfven waves in the shear
layer at the base of the convection zone is also considered. The periodical
impulsive growth is characteristic to the energy density of Alfven and Rossby
waves and they propagate as localized in time powerful pulses. Such behavior of
waves well explains mechanisms of the solar flare excitement and activity.

outflow is assumed to take place during the $\sim$1 Gyr of the halo formation,
while the disk is built by slowly infalling gas. This description of the
halo+disk evolution can correctly account for the main observational
constraints (at least in the framework of simple models of galactic chemical

mass M=2 10^8 M_\odot turning on at z=12, located at a node of the cosmic web.
The study includes a Spectral Energy Distribution of a zero-metallicity stellar
population, and two Initial Mass Functions (Salpeter/Larson). The expansion of
the I-front is followed as it breaks out from the galaxy and it is channeled by
the filaments into the voids, assuming, in a 2D representation, a
characteristic butterfly shape. The ionization evolution is very well tracked
by our scheme, as realized by the correct treatment of the channeling and
shadowing effects due to overdensities. We confirm previous claims that both
the shape of the IMF and the ionizing power metallicity dependence are
important to correctly determine the reionization of the universe.

current fluctuations in mesoscopic conductors, most recently involving the
possibility of its appearance in the passage to the macroscopic limit. Shot
noise is normally absent from solid-state conductors in the large, and its
anomalous resurgence there has been ascribed to a rich interplay of drift,
diffusion, and Coulomb screening. We demonstrate that essentially the same rise
in shot noise occurs in a much less complex system: the Boltzmann-Drude-Lorentz
model of a macroscopic, uniform gas of strictly noninteracting carriers. We
conclude that the ""anomalous crossover"" is a manifestation of simple kinetics.
Poissonian carriers, if driven by a high enough field, cross the sample faster
than any scattering time, thus fulfilling Schottky's condition for ideal shot
noise.

time polymer reaction kinetics in melts or dilute solutions. The photolysis of
groups centrally located along chain backbones, one group per chain, creates
pairs of spatially highly correlated macroradicals. We calculate time-dependent
rate coefficients $\kappa(t)$ governing their first order recombination
kinetics, which are novel on account of the far-from-equilibrium initial
conditions. In dilute solutions (good solvents) reaction kinetics are
intrinsically weak, despite the highly reactive radical groups involved. This
leads to a generalised mean field kinetics in which the rate of radical density
decay $-\ndot \twid S(t)$ where $S(t)\twid t^{-(1+g/3)}$ is the {\em
equilibrium} return probability for 2 reactive groups, given initial contact.
Here $g\approx 0.27$ is the correlation hole exponent for self-avoiding chain
ends. For times beyond the longest coil relaxation time $\tau$, $-\ndot \twid
S(t)$ remains true, but center of gravity coil diffusion takes over with rms
displacement of reactive groups $x(t)\twid t^{1/2}$ and $S(t)\twid 1/x^3(t)$.
At the shortest times ($t\lsim 10^{-6}$ sec), recombination is inhibited due to
spin selection rules and we find $\ndot \twid t S(t)$. In melts, kinetics are
intrinsically diffusion-controlled, leading to entirely different rate laws.
During the regime limited by spin selection rules, the density of radicals
decays linearly, $n(0)-n(t)\twid t$. At longer times the standard result
$-\ndot\twid dx^3(t)/dt$ (for randomly distributed ends) is replaced by
$\ndot\twid d^2x^3(t)/dt^2$ for these correlated initial conditions. The long
time behavior, $t>\tau$, has the same scaling form in time as for dilute

temperatures hopping is present in the system as indicated by a secondary peak
in the distribution of particle displacements during a time interval 't'. The
dynamics of the model is analyzed in terms of its potential energy landscape
(potential energy as function of the 3N particle coordinates), and we present
direct numerical evidence for a 30 years old picture of the dynamics at
sufficiently low temperatures. Transitions between local potential energy
minima in configuration space are found to involve particles moving in a
cooperative string-like manner.
  II) In the symmetric hopping model particles are moving on a lattice by doing
thermally activated hopping over energy barriers connecting nearest neighbor
sites. This model is analyzed in the extreme disorder limit (i.e. low
temperatures) using the Velocity Auto Correlation (VAC) method. The VAC method
is developed in this thesis and has the advantage over previous methods, that
it can calculate a diffusive regime in finite samples using periodic boundary

counting expressions---which plays an important role in the area of knowledge
representation. The algorithm employs a tableaux approach and is the first
known algorithm which meets the lower bound for the complexity of the problem.
Thus, we exactly fix the complexity of the problem and refute an
ExpTime-hardness conjecture. We extend the results to the logic Gr(K_(R \cap

accessibility relations. This establishes a kind of ``theoretical benchmark''
that all algorithmic approaches can be measured against.

In order to perform such an extension, we require the general non symmetric
stress-energy tensor to be conserved leading, as Cartan pointed out himself, to
a strong constraint relating curvature and torsion of spacetime. When we
restrict ourselves to the class of space-times satisfying this constraint, we
are able to properly describe thin shells and derive the general expression of
surface stress-energy tensor both in its four-dimensional and in its
three-dimensional intrinsic form. We finally derive a general family of static
solutions of the Einstein-Cartan theory exhibiting a natural family of null
hypersurfaces and use it to apply our formalism to the construction of a null
shell of matter.

a {\em light-like} direction.
  Under this reformulation we analyze the physical spectrum as that of a free

potential. The discrete light-cone momentum in our framework is naturally
interpreted as the ``winding number'' of the long string configuration and is

primary states possessing the different light-cone momenta and the spectral
flow consistently acts on the space of chiral primaries. We observe that they
are also chiral primaries in the sense of space-time (or the conformal theory
of long string) and the spectrum of space-time $U(1)_R$ charge is consistent

from string theory. Our building blocks are Type II D-branes which we combine
appropriately to reproduce desirable features of a particle theory model: 1)
Chirality ; 2) Standard Model group ; 3) N=1 or N=0 supersymmetry ; 4) Three
quark-lepton generations. We start such a program by studying configurations of
D=10, Type IIB D3-branes located at singularities. We study in detail the case
of Z_N, N=1,0 orbifold singularities leading to the SM group or some left-right
symmetricextension. In general, tadpole cancellation conditions require the
presence of additional branes, e.g. D7-branes. For the N=1 supersymmetric case
the unique twist leading to three quark-lepton generations is Z_3, predicting
$\sin^2\theta_W=3/14=0.21$. The models obtained are the simplest semirealistic
string models ever built. In the non-supersymmetric case there is a
three-generation model for each Z_N, N>4, but the Weinberg angle is in general
too small. One can obtain a large class of D=4 compact models by considering
the above structure embedded into a Calabi Yau compactification. We explicitly
construct examples of such compact models using Z_3 toroidal orbifolds and
orientifolds, and discuss their properties. In these examples, global
cancellation of RR charge may be achieved by adding anti-branes stuck at the
fixed points, leading to models with hidden sector gravity-induced
supersymmetry breaking. More general frameworks, like F-theory
compactifications, allow completely $\NN=1$ supersymmetric embeddings of our
local structures, as we show in an explicit example.
