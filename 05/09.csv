regions in these dwarfs are all so young that they are still expanding, or
there is an unexpected source of disk self-gravity that increases the
background pressure. We consider the possibility that the additional
self-gravity comes from disk dark matter, but suggest this is unlikely because
the vertical scale heights inferred for Irregular galaxies are consistent with
the luminous matter alone. Some of the HII region overpressure is probably the
result of local peaks in the gravitational field that come from large gas
concentrations, many of which are observed directly. These peaks also explain
the anomalously low average column density thresholds for star formation that
were found earlier for Irregular galaxies, and they permit the existence of a
cool HI phase as the first step toward dense molecular cores. Many of the HII
regions could also be so strongly over-pressured that they will expand for a
long time. In this case, the observed population would be only 7% of the total,
and the aging HII regions, now too faint to see, should occupy nearly the
entire dwarf galaxy volume. Such prolonged HII region expansion would explain
the origin of the giant HI shells that are seen in these galaxies, and account
for the lack of bright central clusters inside these shells.

result of starburst phases of the cluster galaxies, assumed to produce the

$10^{-7}$ Gauss. This estimate may increase to the level of $10^{-6}$ Gauss if
more extreme galactic parameters, and subsequent shear amplification of the

Wind Bubbles with Parker-type spiral field configurations over scales of the
distance between galaxies. Further cluster accretion, that continues
chaotically in space and time up to the present, will perturb these
""large-scale"" mean fields on smaller or at best comparable spatial scales. The
small scale fields in the resulting turbulent fluctuation spectrum should be
able to confine relativistic particles over times longer than the age of the
Universe. The nonthermal particle content of galaxy clusters should therefore
also have a ""cosmological"" hadronic component generated during the early
starburst phase of the member galaxies. Already by itself it implies a
nonthermal energy fraction of about 10 percent for the Intracluster gas which
should then be detectable by future gamma-ray telescopes.

synthesis. Abundances of eight n-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu,

from the red spectra for an additional 27 stars. Overall, the abundances show
clear evidence for a large star-to-star dispersion in the heavy element-to-iron
ratios. The new data also confirm that at metallicities [Fe/H] <~ --2.4, the
abundance pattern of the heavy (Z >= 56) n-capture elements in most giants is
well-matched to a scaled Solar System r-process nucleosynthesis pattern. The
onset of the main r-process can be seen at [Fe/H] ~ --2.9. Contributions from
the s-process can first be seen in some stars with metallicities as low as
[Fe/H] ~ --2.75, and are present in most stars with metallicities [Fe/H] >
--2.3. The lighter n-capture elements (Sr-Y-Zr) are enhanced relative to the
heavier r-process element abundances. Their production cannot be attributed
solely to any combination of the Solar System r- and main s-processes, but
requires a mixture of material from the r-process and from an additional
n-capture process which can operate at early Galactic time.

going from start to finish in only 1 or 2 dynamical times on a wide range of
scales. This result, combined with the observation that the IMF is independent
of cluster density over a factor of several hundred, implies that protostar
coagulation during orbital motions in a cloud are not important for the IMF:
there is not enough time. The observation that the IMF in individual clusters
is about the same as the IMF in whole galaxies implies that stars of all masses
form randomly in self-gravitating clouds of all masses. There cannot be a
sequence of stellar masses in a cluster, based on stirring or heating for
example, where the largest star that forms keeps increasing until the cloud is
destroyed. The uniformity of the IMF over time and space argues for a process
that is independent of specific properties of molecular clouds. This
uniformity, along with the common observation of young stars in hierarchical
clusters that resemble the structures of interstellar gas, suggests that the
IMF, at least in the power law range, is a by-product of turbulence. Detailed
physical processes may affect the turnover at low mass, but even this may have
a universal character arising from a combination of turbulence-induced
variations in the local cloud properties, and fragmentation in unstable cloud
pieces.

Guhathakurta et al. (1992) used pre-refurbishment WFPC1 V-band images to derive

a superposition of two King profiles (r_c = 8"" and r_c = 25"") based on U-band
FOC images. De Marchi et al. (1996) used deep WFPC1 U-band images to derive r_c
= 12"" +/- 2"". Differences in the adopted cluster centers are not the cause of
the discrepancy. Our independent analysis of the data used by De Marchi et al.
reaches the following conclusions: (1) De Marchi et al.'s r_c ~ 12"" value is
spuriously low, a result of radially-varying bias in the star counts in a
magnitude limited sample -- photometric errors and a steeply rising stellar
luminosity function cause more stars to scatter across the limiting magnitude
into the sample than out of it, especially near the cluster center where
crowding effects are most severe. (2) Changing the limiting magnitude to the
main sequence turnoff, away from the steep part of the luminosity function,
partially alleviates the problem and results in r_c = 18"". (3) Combining such a
limiting magnitude with accurate photometry derived from PSF fitting, instead
of the less accurate aperture photometry employed by De Marchi et al., results
in a reliable measurement of the density profile which is well fit by r_c = 22""
+/- 2"". Archival WFPC2 data are used to derive a star list with a higher degree
of completeness, greater photometric accuracy, and wider areal coverage than
the WFPC1 and FOC data sets; the WFPC2-based density profile supports the above
conclusions, yielding r_c = 24"" +/- 1.9"".

of this is a substantial increase in the dwarf's vulnerability to eventual

Universe from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the upcoming
missions, MAP and Planck. This can be done by studying the statistical
properties of the CMB temperature field at many X-ray cluster positions. At
each cluster position, the CMB temperature fluctuation will be a combination of
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) kinematic and thermal components, the cosmological
fluctuations and the instrument noise term. When averaged over many such
clusters the last three will integrate down, whereas the first one will be
dominated by a possible bulk flow component. In particular, we propose to use
all-sky X-ray cluster catalogs that should (or could) be available soon from
X-ray satellites, and then to evaluate the dipole component of the CMB field at
the cluster positions. We show that for the MAP and Planck mission parameters
the dominant contributions to the dipole will be from the terms due to the SZ
kinematic effect produced by the bulk flow (the signal we seek) and the
instrument noise (the noise in our signal). Computing then the expected
signal-to-noise ratio for such measurement, we get that at the 95 % confidence
level the bulk flows on scales >100h^{-1} Mpc can be probed down to the
amplitude of $< 200$ km/sec with the MAP data and down to only 30 km/sec with
the Planck mission.

nodes required for finding all solutions or proving that no solution exists
grows exponentially with the number of variables. So this model might be an
interesting distribution for studying the nature of hard instances and
evaluating the performance of CSP algorithms. In addition, we further
investigate the behaviour of the average number of nodes as r (the ratio of
constraints to variables) varies. The results indicate that as r increases,
random CSP instances get easier and easier to solve, and the base for the
average number of nodes that is exponential in r tends to 1 as r approaches

an efficient manner if implemented systems are to be effective in real

subsumption reasoning with respect to a terminology is a fundamental problem.
Two optimisation techniques that have proved to be particularly effective in

seek to improve our theoretical understanding of these important techniques. We
define a formal framework that allows the techniques to be precisely described,
establish conditions under which they can be safely applied, and prove that,

A679 (2001) 373-392","10.1016/S0375-9474(00)00365-1",,"nucl-th",,"  We study the effect of a direct Giant Dipole Resonance ($GDR$) excitation in
intermediate dinuclear systems with exotic shape and charge distributions
formed in charge asymmetric fusion entrance channels. A related enhancement of
the $GDR$ gamma yield in the evaporation cascade of the fused nucleus is
expected. The dynamical origin of such $GDR$ extra strength will show up in a
characteristic anisotropy of the dipole gamma-emission. A fully microscopic
analysis of the fusion dynamics is performed with quantitative predictions of
the $GDR$ photon yield based on a dynamics- statistics coupling model. In
particular we focus our attention on the energy and mass dependence of the
effect.
  We suggest a series of new experiments, in particular some optimal entrance
channel conditions. We stress the importance of using the new available
radioactive beams.

A 61, 0234101 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevA.61.023410",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  We use a method based on optical coherent transients to study the vibrational
coherence lifetimes of atoms trapped in the potential wells of a near-resonant
optical lattice in the oscillating regime. The dependence of the positions and
widths of the vibrational Raman resonances of the coherent transient spectra on
the intensity, detuning, and geometry of the lattice beams is investigated and
the results are compared with theoretical predictions. It is shown that the
principal source of broadening of the vibrational Raman resonances is the
anharmonicity of the light-shift potential wells. We also perform time-resolved
measurements of the vibrational excitation of atoms equilibrating in an optical
lattice.

S={(phi in R mod 2pi, p>0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of
the group SO(1,2) the present paper proposes an application of those results to
the old problem of quantizing modulus and phase in interference phenomena: The
self-adjoint Lie algebra generators K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group correspond
to the classical observables p cos(phi), -p sin(phi) and p > 0 the Poisson
brackets of which obey that Lie algebra, too. For the irreducible unitary
representations of the positive series the modulus operator K_3 has the
positive discrete spectrum {n+k, n=0,1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators
for cos(phi) and sin(phi) can then be defined as (K_3^{-1}K_1 + K_1 K_3^{-1})/2
and - (K_3^{-1} K_2 + K_2 K_3^{-1})/2 which have the theoretically desired
properties for k >0.32. Some matrix elements with respect to number eigenstates
and with respect to coherent states are calculated. One conclusion is that
group theoretical quantization may be tested by quantum optical experiments.
