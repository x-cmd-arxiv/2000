  F. Casoli and J. Lequeux",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This review addresses what can be learned from infrared observations about
galaxies powered predominantly by star formation. Infrared techniques mostly
probe the interstellar medium of galaxies, yielding physical and chemical
information on the medium out of which stars form, which is in turn affected by
those stars. Methods traditionally used in the study of such normal galaxies at
wavelengths longer than 3 microns are described, and major questions currently
pursued in the field are outlined. The most prominent results from the IRAS
survey are reviewed. Contributions by ISO in the field of broad-band photometry
are then presented, followed by ISO results in spectrospcopy. Normal galaxy
studies not directly concerned with the ISM are quickly reviewed. The outlook
and challenges in pursuing the interpretation of infrared data on the ISM are
discussed.

position, $z$, in a simulation of a turbulent accretion disc. An epicyclic
motion of this kind may be caused by a warping of the disc. By studying how the
epicyclic motion decays we can obtain information about the interaction between
the warp and the disc turbulence. A high amplitude epicyclic motion decays
first by exciting inertial waves through a parametric instability, but its
subsequent exponential damping may be reproduced by a turbulent viscosity. We
estimate the effective viscosity parameter, $\alpha_{\rm v}$, pertaining to
such a vertical shear. We also gain new information on the properties of the
disc turbulence in general, and measure the usual viscosity parameter,
$\alpha_{\rm h}$, pertaining to a horizontal (Keplerian) shear. We find that,
as is often assumed in theoretical studies, $\alpha_{\rm v}$ is approximately
equal to $\alpha_{\rm h}$ and both are much less than unity, for the field
strengths achieved in our local box calculations of turbulence. In view of the
smallness ($\sim 0.01$) of $\alpha_{\rm v}$ and $\alpha_{\rm h}$ we conclude
that for $\beta = p_{\rm gas}/p_{\rm mag} \sim 10$ the timescale for diffusion
or damping of a warp is much shorter than the usual viscous timescale. Finally,
we review the astrophysical implications.

lowers the concentration of dark matter in dwarf galaxies as well as in large
galaxies like our own at low redshift, while simultaneously retaining the
virtues of the LCDM model. The model solves the problem of over-production of
small dwarf galaxies in the LCDM not by removing them but by identifying them
with failed, ""dark"" galaxies, where star-formation is quenched due to dark
matter evaporation and consequent halo expansion. A dramatic difference between
the LDCDM model and other proposed variants of the LCDM model is that the
small-scale power at high redshift (z>2) in the LDCDM model is enhanced
compared to the LCDM model.
  A COBE-and-cluster normalized LDCDM model can be constructed with the

Omega_{0,b}=0.044, n=1.0, and sigma8=1.06. A clean test of this model can be
made by measuring the evolution of gas fraction in clusters. The prediction is
that the gas fraction should decrease with redshift and is smaller by 31% at

dominates the CO emission from this system. The largest molecular complexes
have masses of 3-6x10^8 M_sun, typically an order of magnitude larger than the
largest structures seen to date in more quiescent galaxy disks. The extremely
red luminous star clusters identified previously with HST are well-correlated
with the CO emission, which supports the conclusion that they are highly
embedded young objects rather than old globular clusters. There is an excellent
correlation between the CO emission and the 15 micron emission seen with ISO,
particularly for the brightest regions. The most massive complexes in the
overlap region have similar [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios, which implies that all these
regions are forming many massive stars. However, only the brightest
mid-infrared peak shows strong, rising continuum emission longward of 10
microns, indicative of very small dust grains heated to high temperatures by
their proximity to nearby luminous stars. Since these grains are expected to be
removed rapidly from the immediate environment of the massive stars, it is
possible that this region contains very young (< 1 Myr) sites of star
formation. Alternatively, fresh dust grains could be driven into the sphere of
influence of the massive stars, perhaps by the bulk motions of two giant
molecular complexes. The kinematics and morphology of the CO emission in this
region provide some support for this second scenario.

the soft gamma ray repeaters (SGRs) and the dim thermal neutron stars (DTNs)
suggests a common mechanism with an asymptotic spindown phase through the
propeller and early accretion stages. The DTNs are in the propeller stage.
Their luminosities arise from frictional heating in the neutron star. If the
8.4 s rotation period of the DTN RXJ 0720.4-3125 is close to its rotational
equilibrium period, the propeller torque indicates a magnetic field in the
10$^{12}$ Gauss range. The mass inflow rate onto the propeller is of the order
of the AXP accretion rates. The limited range of rotation periods, taken to be
close to equilibrium periods, and magnetic fields in the range 5 E11- 5 E12
Gauss correspond to mass inflow rates 3.2 E14 gm/s < \dot{M} < 4.2 E17 gm/s.
Observed spindown rates of the AXPs and SGRs also fit in with these fields
rather than magnetar fields periods. The source of the mass inflow is a remnant
accretion disk formed as part of the fallback during the supernova explosion.
These classes of sources thus represent the alternative pathways for those
neutron stars that do not become radio pulsars. For the highest mass inflow
rates the propeller action may support enough circumstellar material so that
the optical thickness to electron scattering destroys the X-ray beaming, and
the rotation period is not observable. These are the radio quiet neutron stars

more luminous events. The interpretation of these results is made difficult,
however, due to the fact that galaxies with younger stellar populations are
also lower in luminosity. In an attempt to remove this ambiguity we use models
for the line strengths in the absorption spectrum of five early-type galaxies,

addition of abundance estimates from nebular analysis of the emission spectra

state of the one-dimensional (1D) s=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet are
dominated by a two-parameter set of collective excitations. In a cyclic chain
of N sites and magnetization 0<M_z<N/2, the ground state, which contains 2M_z
spinons, is reconfigured as the physical vacuum for a different species of
quasi-particles, identifiable in the framework of the coordinate Bethe ansatz
by characteristic configurations of Bethe quantum numbers. The dynamically
dominant excitations are found to be scattering states of two such
quasi-particles. For N -> \infty, these collective excitations form a continuum
in (q,\omega)-space with an incommensurate soft mode. Their matrix elements in
the dynamic spin structure factor S_{zz}(q,\omega) are calculated directly from
the Bethe wave functions for finite N. The resulting lineshape predictions for
N -> \infty complement the exact results previously derived via algebraic
analysis for the exact 2-spinon part of S_{zz}(q,\omega) in the zero-field
limit. They are directly relevant for the interpretation of neutron scattering
data measured in nonzero field on quasi-1D antiferromagnetic compounds.

form of scale-invariant distributions that are essentially independent of the
details of the microscopic dynamics. A representative paradigm of complex
behavior in nature is cooperative evolution. The interaction of individuals
gives rise to a wide variety of collective phenomena that strongly differ from
individual dynamics---such as demographic evolution, cultural and technological
development, and economic activity. A striking example of such cooperative
phenomena is the formation of urban aggregates which, in turn, can be
considered to cooperate in giving rise to nations. We find that population and
area distributions of nations follow an inverse power-law behavior, as is known
for cities. The exponents, however, are radically different in the two cases
($\mu \approx 1$ for nations, $\mu \approx 2$ for cities). We interpret these
findings by developing growth models for cities and for nations related to
basic properties of partition of the plane. These models allow one to
understand the empirical findings without resort to the introduction of complex

typically an order of magnitude smaller than expected from large N_c arguments.
With its standard ^3P_0 pair creation operator for hadronic decays by flux tube
breaking, the quark model respects the OZI rule at tree level and exhibits the
cancellations between OZI-violating meson loop diagrams required for this
dramatic suppression. However, if the quark model explanation for these
cancellations is correct, then OZI violation would be expected to be large in
the nonet with the same quantum numbers as the pair creation operator: the
0^{++} mesons. Experiment is currently unable to identify these mesons, but we
report here on a lattice QCD calculation which confirms that the OZI rule
arises from QCD in the vector and axial vector mesons as observed, and finds a
large violation of the rule in the scalar mesons as anticipated by the quark
model. In view of this result, we make some remarks on possible connections
between the ^3P_0 pair creation model, scalar mesons, and the U_A(1) anomaly

believed that the bulk of the effect is due to long distance dynamics that
cannot be described at the quark level. We point out that in general the OPE
yields soft GIM suppression scaling only like (m_s/\mu_{hadr})^2 and even like
m_s/\mu_{hadr} rather than m_s^4/m_c^4 of the simple quark box diagram. Such
contributions can actually yield \Delta M_D, \Delta \Gamma_D \sim
O(10^{-3})*\Gamma_D without invoking additional long distance effects. They are
reasonably suppressed as long as the OPE and local duality are qualitatively
applicable in the 1/m_c expansion. We stress the importance of improving the
sensitivity on \Delta \Gamma_D as well as \Delta M_D in a dedicated fashion as
a laboratory for analyzing the onset of quark-hadron duality and comment on the

F-term constraints. These field theories are dual to superstring theories
propagating on deformations of the AdS_5xS^5 geometry. We study D-branes
propagating in these vacua and introduce the appropriate notion of algebraic
geometry for non-commutative spaces. The resulting moduli spaces of D-branes
have several novel features. In particular, they may be interpreted as
symmetric products of non-commutative spaces. We show how mirror symmetry
between these deformed geometries and orbifold theories follows from T-duality.
Many features of the dual closed string theory may be identified within the

the K-theory necessary for backgrounds where the Neveu-Schwarz antisymmetric
tensor of the string is turned on, and we shed light on some aspects of

A few such formulas were essentially known to Whipple in 1920's. Here we give a
simpler and more complete overview of this type of evaluations. Additionally,
algorithmic aspects of evaluating hypergeometric series are considered. We
illustrate Zeilberger's method and discuss its applicability to non-terminating
series, and present a couple of similar generalizations of other known
formulas.

firing rates sustained throughout the memory period of a working memory task.
How the nervous system forms and maintains these memories is unknown but
reverberating neuronal network activity is thought to be important. We studied
the temporal structure of single unit (SU) activity and simultaneously recorded
local field potential (LFP) activity from area LIP in the inferior parietal
lobe of two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using multitaper
techniques for spectral analysis, which play an important role in obtaining the
present results, we find elevations in spectral power in a 50--90 Hz (gamma)
frequency band during the memory period in both SU and LFP activity. The
activity is tuned to the direction of the saccade providing evidence for
temporal structure that codes for movement plans during working memory. We also
find SU and LFP activity are coherent during the memory period in the 50--90 Hz
gamma band and no consistent relation is present during simple fixation.
Finally, we find organized LFP activity in a 15--25 Hz frequency band that may
be related to movement execution and preparatory aspects of the task. Neuronal
activity could be used to control a neural prosthesis but SU activity can be
hard to isolate with cortical implants. As the LFP is easier to acquire than SU
activity, our finding of rich temporal structure in LFP activity related to
movement planning and execution may accelerate the development of this medical
application.
