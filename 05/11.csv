density cusp, which are observationally disfavored. If CDM particles have an
annihilation cross section sigma*v ~ 10**(-29) (m/GeV) cm**2, then
annihilations will soften the cusps. We discuss plausible scenarios for
avoiding the early Universe annihilation catastrophe that could result from
such a large cross section. The predicted scaling of core density with halo
mass depends upon the velocity dependence of sigma*v, and s-wave annihilation
leads to a core density nearly independent of halo mass, which seems consistent
with observations.

of the proposed orbital planes of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and it has
been proposed to be a detached LMC globular cluster captured by the Milky Way.
We present the first measurement of the radial velocity of the Pyxis globular
cluster based on spectra of six Pyxis giant stars. The mean heliocentric radial
velocity is ~ 36 km/sec, and the corresponding velocity of Pyxis with respect
to a stationary observer at the position of the Sun is ~ -191 km/sec. This
radial velocity is a large enough fraction of the cluster's expected total
space velocity, assuming that it is bound to the Milky Way, that it allows
strict limits to be placed on the range of permissible transverse velocities
that Pyxis could have in the case that it still shares or nearly shares an
orbital pole with the LMC. We can rule out that Pyxis is on a near circular
orbit if it is Magellanic debris, but we cannot rule out an eccentric orbit
associated with the LMC. We have calculated the range of allowed proper motions
for the Pyxis globular cluster that result in the cluster having an orbital
pole within 15 degrees of the present orbital pole of the LMC and that are
consistent with our measured radial velocity, but verification of the tidal
capture hypothesis must await proper motion measurement from the Space
Interferometry Mission or HST. A spectroscopic metallicity estimate of [Fe/H] =
-1.4 +/- 0.1 is determined for Pyxis from several spectra of its brightest
giant; this is consistent with photometric determinations of the cluster

variation in emission-line properties on kpc scales. Continuum modelling and
subtraction enables the faint emission line fluxes to be measured in several
regions across the emission line nebula. We plot diagnostic line-ratio diagrams

finding that the data is best fit by models which assume a mixture of optically
thin and thick clouds illuminated by a power-law continuum.
  The emission line kinematics, line ratios and deduced physical conditions
show remarkably little variation across the source. We deduce a mean electron
density of 400 +/- 120 cm-3 and a mean temperature of 11500 +/- 1500 K.
Assuming a single population of optically thick line-emitting clouds, we
calculate a mean photoionization parameter of (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10e-2 and hence a
photoionizing photon luminosity of Q ~ 10e55 -- 10e56 photon/s/sr. This
indicates a central engine as luminous as that of the powerful quasar 3C 273,
yet there is no evidence for such an energetically prolific central engine at
either far-infrared or radio wavelengths. We therefore conclude that the
mixed-media models, which give Q ~ 5 x 10e53 -- 5 x 10e54, represent a more
likely scenario.
  As a by-product of the continuum subtraction we infer that young stellar
populations account for ~ 0.4% of the visible stellar mass in the galaxy, and
that these populations are spatially extended.

so-called ``horizontal branch oscillations'' (HBO, with frequencies ~50 Hz),
the ``lower-frequency kHz quasi-periodic oscillation'' (QPO) and the
``upper-frequency kHz QPO'', with the latter two features being separated in
frequency by an amount comparable to, but varying slightly from, the suspected
spin-frequency of the neutron star. Recently, Psaltis, Belloni, & van der Klis
(1999) have suggested that there exists a correlation between these three
frequencies that, when certain identifications of variability features are
made, even encompasses black hole sources. We consider this hypothesis by
reanalyzing a set of GX 339-4 observations. The power spectral density (PSD)
constructed from a composite of 7 separate, but very similar, observations
shows evidence for three broad peaks in the PSD. If the peak frequencies of
these features are identified with ``QPO'', then their frequencies
approximately fit the correlations suggested by Psaltis, Belloni, & van der
Klis (1999). We also reanalyze a Cyg X-1 observation and show that the
suggested QPO correlation may also hold, but that complications arise when the
``QPOs'' (which, in reality, are fairly broad features) are considered as a
function of energy band. These fits suggest the existence of at least three
separate, independent physical processes in the accretion flow, a hypothesis
that is also supported by consideration of the Fourier frequency-dependent time
lags and coherence function between variability in different energy bands.

Universe, which subsequently evolve into the cores of the richest clusters seen
at the present day. These regions are characterised by over-densities of young
galaxies, perhaps including a population of dusty, interaction-driven
starbursts - the progenitors of massive cluster ellipticals. By searching for
this population at submm wavelengths we can therefore test both galaxy- and
structure-formation models. We have undertaken such a search in the field of a
z=3.8 radio galaxy, 4C41.17, with the SCUBA submm camera. Our extremely deep
450- and 850-micron maps reveal an order-of-magnitude over-density of luminous
submm galaxies compared to typical fields (the likelihood of finding such an
over-density in a random field is <2E-3). The SCUBA galaxies have bolometric
luminosities, >10^13 L(solar), which imply star-formation rates consistent with
those required to form a massive galaxy in only a few 10^8 years. We also note
that this field exhibits an over-density of extremely red objects (EROs), some
of which may be associated with the submm sources, and Lyman-break galaxies. We
propose that the over-densities of both submm and ERO sources in this field
represent young dusty, starburst galaxies forming within a proto-cluster

their inter-relationship, increase awareness of advanced technologies such as
software radios and photonics, and foster a cooperative approach to the
development of interference mitigation techniques. The foremost application in
mind was the square kilometre array (SKA) and the need to find ways to develop
an hierarchical scheme for removing unwanted signals from astronomical data.
This paper gives an overview of the topics discussed at the conference and
summarises some of the key ideas and results that were presented.
  Many of the interference challenges we face can be overcome with technical
solutions. There will always be a place for regulatory and legal approaches to
spectrum management, but too much reliance has been placed on these in the
past. The strategy of avoidance has worked well in the past and will continue
to be useful in the future, but is now limited by the growth of space based
communications systems, which are visible everywhere on Earth. There is no
technical solution which is likely to provide a silver bullet. Rather a
hierarchical approach will be required, combining a range of techniques. We
have just begun exploring technical solutions and their toxicity to
astronomical data. We need to continue on this path, determining which
techniques are best and how they interact in order to develop a flexible and
powerful system for interference suppression.

blue luminosity of the dwarf is about unity, which is comparable to such ratios
in dwarf irregular galaxies. The ram pressure experienced by the dwarf galaxy
in the hot gaseous halo of M86 was comparable to the internal gravitational
binding energy density of the presumed former gas disk in VCC 882. Published
numerical models of this case are consistent with the overall trail-like
morphology observed here. Three concentrations in the trail may be evidence for
the predicted periodicity of the mass loss. The evaporation time of the trail
is comparable to the trail age obtained from the relative speed of the galaxies
and the trail length. Thus the trail could be continuously formed from stripped
replenished gas if the VCC 882 orbit is bound. However, the high gas mass and
the low expected replenishment rate suggest that this is only the first
stripping event. Implications for the origin of nucleated dwarf ellipticals are
briefly discussed.

binaries have relatively large runaway velocities whereas Be/X-ray binaries
have low runaway velocities, provides confirmation of the current models for
the formation of these two types of systems. These predict a difference in
runaway velocity of an order of magnitude. This difference basically results
from the variation of the fractional helium core mass as a function of stellar
mass, in combination with the conservation of orbital angular momentum during
the mass transfer phase that preceded the formation of the compact object in
the system. This combination results into: (i) Systematically narrower
pre-supernova orbits in the OB-supergiant systems than in the Be-systems, and
(ii) A larger fractional amount of mass ejected in the supernovae in high-mass
systems relative to systems of lower mass. Regardless of possible kick
velocities imparted to neutron stars at birth, this combination leads to a
considerable difference in average runaway velocity between these two groups.
The observed low runaway velocities of the Be/X-ray binaries confirm that in
most cases not more than 1 to 2Msun was ejected in the supernovae that produced
their neutron stars. This, in combination with the --on average-- large orbital
eccentricities of these systems, indicates that their neutron stars must have
received a velocity kick in the range 60 - 250 km/s at birth.

possess strong, broad Lyman-alpha emission lines, with the characteristic sharp

quasars contain strong, broad absorption features, and one of them exhibits
very strong N V emission. The amount of absorption produced by the Lyman-alpha

potential of the parent Galaxy. Our model clusters are generally significantly
flattened in the Galactic tidal field, and dissolve before deep core collapse
occurs. The binary fraction decreases initially due to the destruction of soft
binaries, but increases later because lower mass single stars escape more
easily than the more massive binaries. At late times, the cluster core is quite
rich in giants and white dwarfs. There is no evidence for preferential
evaporation of old white dwarfs, on the contrary the formed white dwarfs are
likely to remain in the cluster. Stars tend to escape from the cluster through
the first and second Lagrange points, in the direction of and away from the
Galactic center. Mass segregation manifests itself in our models well within an
initial relaxation time. As expected, giants and white dwarfs are much more
strongly affected by mass segregation than main-sequence stars. Open clusters
are dynamically rather inactive. However, the combined effect of stellar mass
loss and evaporation of stars from the cluster potential drives its dissolution
on a much shorter timescale than if these effects are neglected. The often-used
argument that a star cluster is barely older than its relaxation time and

generalize the axiomatic approach of Quinn and Wald in order to produce a

Orbit (LSO) in circular general relativistic orbits of two point masses. We use
several different ``resummation methods'' (including new ones) based on the
consideration of gauge-invariant functions, and compare the results they give
at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation of general relativity. Our
treatment is based on the 3PN Hamiltonian of Jaranowski and Sch\""afer. One of
the new methods we introduce is based on the consideration of the (invariant)
function linking the angular momentum and the angular frequency. We also
generalize the ``effective one-body'' approach of Buonanno and Damour by
introducing a non-minimal (i.e. ``non-geodesic'') effective dynamics at the 3PN
level. We find that the location of the LSO sensitively depends on the
(currently unknown) value of the dimensionless quantity $\oms$ which
parametrizes a certain regularization ambiguity of the 3PN dynamics. We find,
however, that all the analytical methods we use numerically agree between
themselves if the value of this parameter is $\oms\simeq-9$. This suggests that
the correct value of $\oms$ is near -9 (the precise value
$\oms^*\equiv-{47/3}+{41/64}\pi^2=-9.3439...$ seems to play a special role). If
this is the case, we then show how to further improve the analytical
determination of various LSO quantities by using a ``Shanks'' transformation to
accelerate the convergence of the successive (already resummed) PN estimates.

in support of grand unification is now strong. It includes: (i) the observed
family-structure, (ii) the meeting of the gauge couplings, (iii)
neutrino-oscillations, (iv) the intricate pattern of the masses and mixings of
all fermions, including the neutrinos, and (v) the need for $B-L$ as a
generator, to implement baryogenesis. Taken together, these not only favor
grand unification but in fact select out a particular route to such
unification, based on the ideas of supersymmetry, SU(4)-color and left-right
symmetry. Thus they point to the relevance of an effective string-unified
G(224) or SO(10)-symmetry.
  A concrete proposal is presented, within a predictive
SO(10)/G(224)-framework, that successfully describes the masses and mixings of
all fermions, including the neutrinos - with eight predictions, all in
agreement with observation. Within this framework, a systematic study of proton
decay is carried out, which pays special attention to its dependence on the
fermion masses, including the superheavy Majorana masses of the right-handed
neutrinos. The study shows that a conservative upper limit on the proton
lifetime is about (1/2 - 1)$\times10^{34}$ yrs, with $\overline{\nu}K^{+}$
being the dominant decay mode, and as a distinctive feature, $\mu^{+}K^{0}$
being prominent. This in turn strongly suggests that an improvement in the
current sensitivity by a factor of five to ten (compared to SuperK) ought to
reveal proton decay. Otherwise some promising and remarkably successful ideas
on unification would suffer a major setback.

are much less stringent. The better constraint stems also from the measurement
of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Of all the other tests,
measurements of charge-symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering
provide the next better constraint. The latter experiments were performed at
TRIUMF (at 477 and 347 MeV) and at IUCF (at 183 MeV). Weak decay experiments
(the transverse polarization of the muon in K+ -> pi0 mu+ nu and the transverse
polarization of the positrons in polarized muon decay) have the potential to
provide comparable or possibly better constraints.

of the aspect ratio r (r in [0.1443,6.928]). These data are more precise than
those obtained by Langlands et al as the 95%-confidence interval is brought to
4x10^{-4}. A 3-parameter fit using these new data determines the solution of
the differential equation. The largest gap between this solution and the 40
data is smaller than 4x10^{-4}. The probability pihv of simultaneous horizontal
and vertical crossings is also treated.

We study actions of a locally compact abelian group with ordered dual onto a
space of measures, and consider those measures that are analytic, that is, the
spectrum of the action on the measure is contained within the positive elements
of the dual of the group. The classical results tell us that the singular and
absolutely continuous parts of the measure (with respect to a suitable measure)
are also analytic. The approach taken in this paper is to adopt the
transference principle developed by the authors and Saeki in another paper, and

obtain a decomposition of the measures, and obtain the above mentioned results

speaking, a diagram is a labelled plane graph bounded by a pair of paths (the
top path and the bottom path). To multiply two diagrams, one simply identifies
the top path of one diagram with the bottom path of the other diagram, and
removes pairs of ""reducible"" cells. Each diagram group is determined by an
alphabet $X$, containing all possible labels of edges, a set of relations
${\cal R}=\{u_i=v_i\mid i=1,2,... \}$, containing all possible labels of cells,
and a word $w$ over $X$ -- the label of the top and bottom paths of diagrams.
Diagrams can be considered as 2-dimensional words, and diagram groups can be
considered as 2-dimensional analogue of free groups. In our previous paper, we
showed that the class of diagram groups contains many interesting groups
including the famous R. Thompson group $F$ (it corresponds to the simplest set
of relations $\{x=x^2 \}$), closed under direct and free products and some
other constructions. In this paper we study mainly subgroups of diagram groups.
We show that not every subgroup of a diagram group is itself a diagram group
(this answers a question from the previous paper). We prove that every
nilpotent subgroup of a diagram group is abelian, every abelian subgroup is
free, but even the Thompson group contains solvable subgroups of any degree. We
also study distortion of subgroups in diagram groups, including the Thompson
group. It turnes out that centralizers of elements and abelian subgroups are
always undistorted, but the Thompson group contains distorted soluble
subgroups.

energy. Various definitions of the pairing gap are discussed as three-point,

the pairing potential, and single-quasiparticle energies. Experimental values
for the pairing gap are compared with calculations employing both a delta
pairing force and a density-dependent delta interaction in the BCS and

discussed with coherent entangled states given by beam splittings, we further
discuss two types of models, perfect teleportation model and non-perfect
teleportation model, in general scheme. Then the difference among several
models, i.e., the perfect models and the non-perfect models, is studied. Our
teleportation models are constructed by means of coherent states in some Fock
space with counting measures, so that our model can be treated in the frame of
usual optical communication.

interacting with a continuous set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. The
interaction is linear in the coordinates and the momenta. The model has an
analytical solution that is used to study the time evolution of the reduced
density operator. It is derived in a closed form, in the one-particle sector of
the model. The irreversible behavior of the Brownian particle is described by a
reduced density matrix.

  Information""?","Accepted for Crypto 2000. 17 pages","Proceedings of Crypto 2000, Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
  1880, 482-500, 2000",,,"quant-ph",,"  After carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantum
channel, the parties Alice and Bob must process the raw key in order to end up
with identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information. In
principle, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this
processing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful.
We prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent
eavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in
their classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if and
only if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. In addition, we provide
evidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in
every situation. Consequently, many techniques and results from quantum
information theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory,
and vice versa. For instance, it was previously believed that two parties can
carry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share some
intrinsic information in the adversary's view. The analysis of this purely
classical problem from the quantum information-theoretic viewpoint shows that
this is true in the binary case, but false in general. More explicitly, bound
entanglement, i.e., entanglement that cannot be purified by any quantum
protocol, has a classical counterpart. This ""bound intrinsic information""
cannot be distilled to a secret key by any classical protocol. As another
application we propose a measure for entanglement based on classical
information-theoretic quantities.
