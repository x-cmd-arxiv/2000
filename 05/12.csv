non-linear baryonic mass density distribution in the IGM is lognormal. This
ansatz was used earlier by Bi & Davidsen (1997) to perform 1D simulations of
lines-of-sight and analyse the properties of absorption systems. Our approach
is completely analytic, which allows us to explore a wide region of the
parameter space for our model. The analytic results have been compared with
observations, whenever possible. Two kinds of correlation functions are
defined: along the line-of-sight (LOS) and across the transverse direction. We
find that the effects on the LOS correlation due to change in cosmology and the
slope of the equation of state of the IGM, \gamma are of the same order, which
means that we cannot constrain both the parameters simultaneously. However, it
is possible to constrain \gamma and its evolution using the observed LOS
correlation function at different epochs, provided one knows the background
cosmology. We suggest that the constraints on the evolution of \gamma obtained
using the LOS correlation can be used as an independent tool to probe the
reionisation history of the universe. From the transverse correlation function,
we find that the excess probability, over random, of finding two neutral
hydrogen overdense regions separated by an angle \theta, is always less than 1
per cent for redshifts greater than 2. Our models also reproduce the observed
column density distribution for neutral hydrogen and the shape of the
distribution depends on \gamma. Our calculations suggest that one can rule out
\gamma > 1.6 for z \simeq 2.31 using the column density distribution. However,
one cannot rule higher values of \gamma at higher redshifts.

We demonstrate that the presence of strong inverse Compton cooling can be
deduced from the effect it has on the time-evolution of the cooling break in
the synchrotron spectral component, and therefore on the optical and X-ray
afterglow lightcurves. We then show how the physical interpretation of the
observed characteristics of the synchrotron spectrum must be modified to take
into consideration this extra source of cooling, and give a revised
prescription for computing physical parameters characterizing the expanding
shock wave from the observed quantities. We find that for a given set of
observables (synchrotron break frequencies and fluxes) there is either no

argue that such a detection is possible for GRBs exploding in a reasonably

12 arcsec west of the quasar, coincident with the inner portion of the jet
previously detected in a 4.8 GHz radio image (Tingay et al. 1998). At a
redshift of z=0.651, the jet is the largest (~100 kpc) and most luminous
(~10^{44.6} ergs/s) of the few so far detected in X-rays. This letter presents
a high resolution X-ray image of the jet, from 42 ks of data when PKS 0637-753
was on-axis and ACIS-S was near the optimum focus. For the inner portion of the
radio jet, the X-ray morphology closely matches that of new ATCA radio images
at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz. Observations of the parsec scale core using the VSOP space
VLBI mission show structure aligned with the X-ray jet, placing important
constraints on the X-ray source models. HST images show that there are three
small knots coincident with the peak radio and X-ray emission. Two of these are
resolved, which we use to estimate the sizes of the X-ray and radio knots. The
outer portion of the radio jet, and a radio component to the east, show no
X-ray emission to a limit of about 100 times lower flux.
  The X-ray emission is difficult to explain with models that successfully
account for extra-nuclear X-ray/radio structures in other active galaxies. We
think the most plausible is a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, but this
would imply extreme departures from the conventional minimum-energy and/or
homogeneity assumptions. We also rule out synchrotron or thermal bremsstrahlung
models for the jet X-rays, unless multicomponent or ad hoc geometries are

nearly constant once flows reach a steady state. The time rate of change of the
accretion rate is strongly sensitive to the value of the mass deposition

binding energy to gas temperature. We show that previous scaling arguments
presented by Bertschinger (1988) and White (1988) are valid only for mature
cooling flows with weak mass deposition (q ~< 1). The second set of models

resolution better than $10^{-4}$ of the cube side. We investigate how the
predicted cluster correlations increase for samples of increasing mass and
decreasing abundance. Very similar behaviour is found in the two cases. The
correlation length increases from $r_0=12$ -- 13$h^{-1}$Mpc for samples with
mean separation $d_{\rm c}=30h^{-1}$Mpc to $r_0=22$-- 27$h^{-1}$Mpc for samples

accurately parallel to those of the mass over more than a decade in scale. Both
correlation lengths and power spectrum biases can be predicted to better than
10% using the simple model of Sheth, Mo & Tormen (2000). This prediction
requires only the linear mass power spectrum and has no adjustable parameters.
We compare our predictions with published results for the APM cluster sample.
The observed variation of correlation length with richness agrees well with the

Z~0.01 Z_solar. The high-redshift supernovae that polluted the IGM also
accelerated relativistic electrons. Since the energy density of the CMB scales
as (1+z)^4, at high redshift these electrons cool via inverse Compton
scattering. Thus, the first star clusters emit X-rays. Unlike stellar UV
ionizing photons, these X-rays can escape easily from their host galaxies. This
has a number of important physical consequences: (i) Due to their large mean
free path, these X-rays can quickly establish a universal ionizing background
and partially reionize the universe in a gradual, homogeneous fashion. If
X-rays formed the dominant ionizing background, the universe would have more
closely resembled a single-phase medium, rather than a two-phase medium. (ii)
X-rays can reheat the universe to higher temperatures than possible with UV
radiation. (iii) X-rays counter the tendency of UV radiation to
photo-dissociate H2, an important coolant in the early universe, by promoting
gas phase H2 formation. The X-ray production efficiency is calibrated to local
observations of starburst galaxies, which imply that ~10% of the supernova
energy is converted to X-rays. While direct detection of sources in X-ray
emission is difficult, the presence of relativistic electrons at high redshift
and thus a minimal level of X-ray emission may be inferred by synchrotron
emission observations with the Square Kilometer Array. These sources may
constitute a significant fraction of the unresolved hard X-ray background, and
can account for both the shape and amplitude of the gamma-ray background. This

spectrum of such sources should exhibit an absorption edge due to
pair-production against UV photons along the line of sight. One expects a sharp
drop in the number density of UV photons at the Lyman edge E_{L}. This implies
that the universe becomes transparent after gamma-ray photons redshift below E
(m_{e}c^2)^{2}/E_{L} 18 GeV. Thus, there is only a limited redshift interval
over which GeV photons can pair produce. This implies that any observed
absorption will probe radiation fields in the very early universe, regardless
of the subsequent star formation history of the universe. Furthermore,
measurements of differential absorption between blazars at different redshifts
can cleanly isolate the opacity due to UV emissivity at high redshift. An
observable absorption edge should be present for most reasonable radiation
fields with sufficient energy to reionize the universe. Ly-alpha photons may
provide an important component of the pair-production opacity. Observations of
a number of blazars at different redshifts will thus allow us to probe the rise

67 166), HD 269546 (Sk -68 82) and HD 36402 (Sk 67 104) and summarizes the
ORFEUS H_2 measurements in the the Magellanic Clouds. For seven lines of sight
we investigate correlations between N(H I), N(H_2), E(B-V) and compare the
results with H_2 observations in the Milky Way disk. We find that the abundance
of H_2 is low in comparison to the total gas quantity and speculate that the
fraction of hydrogen in molecular form is limited by the lower dust content of
the Magellanic Clouds.

J1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,
HI 1225+01 (the Virgo HI Cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. The mean
velocity dispersion, measured with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak or
non-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (T<2000 K)
rather than bulk motion or turbulence. The peak column density for HIPASS
J1712-64, from the combined Parkes and ATCA data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,
which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for star
formation. Apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties of
HIPASS J1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of Compact High

Galactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that HIPASS J1712-64

are essentially solar with a few exceptions: Na shows a strong overdeficiency,
the heavy elements Ba to Eu, are overabundant, while Y is underabundat. The
high metallicity derived implies that the Sgr galaxy has experienced a high
level of chemical processing. The stars had been selected to be representative
of the two main stellar populations of Sagittarius, however, contrary to what
expected from the photometry, the two stars show a very similar chemical
composition. We argue that the most likely explanation for the difference in
the photometry of the two stars is a different distance, Sgr 143 being about
2Kpc nearer than Sgr 139. This result suggests that the interpretation of
colour -- magnitude diagrams of Sgr is more complex than previously thought and
the effect of the line of sight depth should not be neglected. It also shows
that spectroscopic abundances are required for a correct interpretation of Sgr

mass fluctuations in the universe. It relies on the measurement of small
coherent distortions of the images of background galaxies. Even low-level
correlations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce a
significant spurious lensing signal. These correlations are also interesting in
their own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxy
formation. Using $3\times 10^{4} - 10^5$ halos found in N-body simulations, we
compute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiral
galaxies assuming that the disk is perpendicular to the angular momentum of the
dark matter halo. We also consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, in
which the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed to be the same as that of
the light. For deep lensing surveys with median redshifts $\sim 1$, we find
that intrinsic correlations of $\sim 10^{-4}$ on angular scales $\theta \sim
0.1-10'$ are generally below the expected lensing signal, and contribute only a
small fraction of the excess signals reported on these scales. On larger scales
we find limits to the intrinsic correlation function at a level $\sim 10^{-5}$,
which gives a (model-dependent) range of separations for which the intrinsic
signal is about an order of magnitude below the ellipticity correlation
function expected from weak lensing. Intrinsic correlations are thus negligible
on these scales for dedicated weak lensing surveys. For wider but shallower
surveys such as SuperCOSMOS, APM and SDSS, we cannot exclude the possibility
that intrinsic correlations could dominate the lensing signal. We discuss how
such surveys could be used to calibrate the importance of this effect, as well
as study spin-spin correlations of spiral galaxies.

(m_B=14.40) galaxy ESO533-G50 at redshift z=0.026. The source is clearly
detected at energies above 4 keV but barely visible below this energy implying
heavy obscuration intrinsic to the source. Spectral analysis indicates a column
density of the order of 2-3 x 10^(23) cm^-2$ and a power law photon index
compatible with values often seen in active galaxies. These X-ray
characteristics suggest a Seyfert 2 classification for 1SAXJ2234.8-2541.
Subsequent spectroscopy of the optical conterpart, ESO533-G50, performed with
the ESO 1.52m telescope at La Silla Observatory, confirms the type 2 nature of
this source and therefore its identification with the X-ray source. We also
report the marginal detection of an iron line centered at 7.29 +/- 0.47 keV and
having an equivalent width of 464 (+636 -398) eV; although marginal, this
result is indicative of the presence of warm material in the source. If instead
the line is associated to cold material, we estimate an upper limit to its
equivalent width of 290 eV. The overall characteristics of 1SAXJ2234.8-2541
strongly suggest that the source is Compton thin.

the blue indices. This could be explained by the presence of red supergiants in
the nuclei of Seyfert 1 galaxies. On the other hand, the blue indices of these
galaxies could also be diluted by the strong FeII multiplets that can be seen
in their spectra.

to understand the formation and evolution of what we expect to become the most
massive of galaxies. In contrast to the quasars, where the nucleus can outshine
the galaxy at optical/near infrared wavelengths by a large factor, the radio
galaxies contain a 'built-in coronograph' that obscures our direct view to the
nucleus. These objects present our best opportunity to study the host galaxy in
detail. Of particular interest are those sources with redshifts greater than
about 2 that represent an epoch when nuclear activity was much more common that
it is now and when we believe these objects were in the process of assembly. In
combination with high resolution imaging from space (HST), optical
spectropolarimetry with Keck II allows us to clearly separate the scattered
nuclear radiation from the stellar and gaseous emission from the host galaxy.

evolution is occurring at this epoch. Near infrared spectroscopy with the VLT

stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to
determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the
twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the HR diagram we were able to
determine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the
remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of
this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which
occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We
suggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper
mixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass
RGB stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase
referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars,
the Li-rich phase occurs on the early-AGB. The compiled data provide
constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes
suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific
trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of
the Li content of the ISM as a result of these episodes is negligible.

mix with the ordinary Higgs bosons; the lightest is absolutely stable. The two
lightest neutral scalars, $\phi_S$, and $\phi_P$, are degenerate in mass, and
the mass difference between those and the lightest charged scalar, $\phi_+$, is
calculated. For most of the parameter space, the charged scalar is between a
hundred MeV and a few GeV heavier than the neutral scalars. The $\phi_+$ will
decay at the vertex; the signature for this decay will be like that of a
chargino with a nearly degenerate undetected neutralino. Next, the possibility
that the symmetry that eliminates FCNC is a flavor symmetry is discussed. In an
example, the U(2) model, tree-level FCNC processes can be calculated in terms
of quark masses. The strongest constraint on this model is from $D-\bar{D}$
mixing, which should be within an order of magnitude of the current bound.

the weak scale and the Planck scale, yielding a mu term of the right order of

relevant couplings in several of the simplest models of this type, and compute
the partial decay widths of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle
involving leptons or jets. Although these decays will have an average proper
decay length which is most likely much larger than a typical collider detector,
they can occasionally occur within the detector, providing a striking signal.
With a large sample of supersymmetric events, there will be an opportunity to
observe these decays, and so gain direct information about physics at very high

of an obvious small parameter. In this paper we show that the formerly
established fusion rules can be employed to develop a theory in which
Kolmogorov's statistics of 1941 acts as the zero order, or background
statistics, and the anomalous corrections to the K41 scaling exponents
$\zeta_n$ of the $n$th order structure functions can be computed analytically.
The crux of the method consists of renormalizing a 4-point interaction
amplitude on the basis of the fusion rules. The novelty is that this amplitude
includes a small dimensionless parameter, which is shown to be of the order of
the anomaly of $\zeta_2$, $\delta_2= \zeta_2-2/3\approx 0.03$. Higher order
interaction amplitudes are shown to be even smaller. The corrections to K41 to
$O(\delta_2)$ result from standard logarithmically divergent ladder-diagrams in
which the 4-point interaction acts as a ""rung"". The theory allows a calculation
of the anomalous exponents $\zeta_n$ in powers of the small parameter
$\delta_2$. The $n$-dependence of the scaling exponents $\zeta_n$ stems from
pure combinatorics of the ladder diagrams. We calculate the exponents $\zeta_n$
up to $O(\delta_2^3)$. Previously derived bridge relations allow a calculation
of the anomalous exponents of correlations of the dissipation field and of
dynamical correlations in terms of the same parameter $\delta_2$. The actual
evaluation of the small parameter $\delta_2$ from first principles requires
additional developments that are outside the scope of this paper.
