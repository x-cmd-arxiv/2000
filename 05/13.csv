Hickson compact groups (HCGs), we present rotation curves of 30 galaxies in 20
HCGs. We found as follows. 1) There is not significant relation between
dynamical peculiarity and morphological peculiarity in HCG spirals. 2) There is
no significant relation between the dynamical properties and the frequency
distribution of nuclear activities in HCG spirals. 3) There are no significant
correlations between the dynamical properties of HCG spirals and any group
properties (i.e., the size, the velocity dispersion, the galaxy number density,
and the crossing time). 4) Asymmetric and peculiar rotation curves are more
frequently seen in the HCG spirals than in field spirals and in cluster ones.
However, this tendency is more obviously seen in late-type HCG spirals. These
results suggest that the dynamical properties of HCG spirals do not strongly
correlate with the morphology, the nuclear activity, and the group properties.
Our results also suggest that more frequent galaxy collisions occur in the HCGs
than in the field and in the clusters.

luminosity - there is not a tight correlation, but the probability of a nuclear
source being detected increases strongly with galaxy luminosity and the
distribution of nuclear luminosities seems to show an upper envelope that is
roughly proportional to galaxy luminosity. While these sources do seem to be a
genuinely nuclear phenomenon rather than nuclear examples of the general X-ray
source population, it is far from obvious that they are miniature Seyfert
nuclei. The more luminous nuclei are very often spatially extended, and HII
region nuclei are detected just as often as LINERs. Finally, we also note the

bands (Grogan et al 1997), features of the zodiacal cloud associated with the
comminution of Hirayama family asteroids, has been limited by the fact that
only small particles (25 micron diameter or smaller) have been considered. This
was due to the prohibitively large amount of computing power required to
numerically analyze the dynamics of larger particles. The recent availability
of cheap, fast processors has finally made this work possible. Models of the
dust bands are created, built from individual dust particle orbits, taking into
account a size-frequency distribution of the material and the dynamical history
of the constituent particles. These models are able to match both the shapes
and amplitudes of the dust band structures observed by IRAS in multiple
wavebands. The size-frequency index, q, that best matches the observations is
approximately 1.4, consistent with the LDEF results in that large particles are
shown to dominate. However, in order to successfully model the `ten degree'
band, which is usually associated with collisional activity within the Eos
family, we find that the mean proper inclination of the dust particle orbits
has to be approximately 9.35 degrees, significantly different to the mean
proper inclination of the Eos family (10.08 degrees).

hydrostatic equilibrium with matter density distribution, we predict the

describes the density field in terms of correlations between and within halos.
The projected pressure power spectrum allows a determination of the resulting

matter distribution. They provide a lower limit to the SZ effect due to large

calculations to discuss higher order statistics, such as bispectrum and
skewness in SZ data. The SZ-weak lensing cross-correlation is suggested as a

of interest to know how much wind power is available and which (if either) of
the two rotators dominates that power. We investigate this in the context of
multi-polar planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe), for
which recent observations have revealed the need for a wind power source in
excess of that available from radiation driving, and a possible need for
magnetic shaping. We calculate the MHD wind power from a coupled disk and star,
where the former results from binary disruption. The resulting wind powers
depend only on the accretion rate and stellar properties. We find that if the
stellar envelope were initially slowly rotating, the disk wind would dominate
throughout the evolution. If the envelope of the star were rapidly rotating,
the stellar wind could initially be of comparable power to the disk wind until
the stellar wind carries away the star's angular momentum. Since an initially
rapidly rotating star can have its spin and magnetic axes misaligned to the
disk, multi-polar outflows can result from this disk wind system. For times
greater than a spin-down time, the post-AGB stellar wind is slaved to the disk
for both slow and rapid initial spin cases and the disk wind luminosity
dominates. We find a reasonably large parameter space where a hybrid star+disk
MHD driven wind is plausible and where both or either can account for PPNe and
PNe powers. We also speculate on the morphologies which may emerge from the
coupled system. The coupled winds might help explain the shapes of a number of
remarkable multi-shell or multi-polar nebulae. Magnetic activity such as X-ray
flares may be associated with the both central star and the disk and would be a
valuable diagnostic for the dynamical role of MHD processes in PNe.

narrow-band imaging, that measure the strength of the 1.9 micron water band, we
determine the spectral type and reddening for every M-type star in the field,
thereby separating cluster members from the interloper population. Due to the
efficiency of our spectral classification technique, our study is complete from
approx 0.7 Msun to 0.015 Msun. The mass function derived for the cluster in
this interval, dN/dlogM \propto M^{0.5}, is similar to that obtained for the
Pleiades, but appears significantly more abundant in brown dwarfs than the mass
function for companions to nearby sun-like stars. This provides compelling
observational evidence for different formation and evolutionary histories for
substellar objects formed in isolation vs. as companions. Because our
determination of the IMF is complete to very low masses, we can place
interesting constraints on the role of physical processes such as fragmentation
in the star and planet formation process and the fraction of dark matter in the

a means for obtaining the configurational entropy. The first method involves
the evaluation of the intra-basin entropy from the vibrational frequencies of
inherent structures, by making a harmonic approximation of the local potential
energy topography. The second method employs simulations that confine the
liquid within a localized region of configuration space by the imposition of
constraints; apart from the choice of the constraints, no further assumptions
are made. We compare the configurational entropies estimated for a model liquid
(binary mixture of particles interacting {\it via} the Lennard-Jones potential)
for a range of temperatures, at fixed density.

unknown. The maximum temperature in the radiation-dominated era, which we will
refer to as the reheat temperature, may have been as low as 0.7 MeV. In this
paper we show that a low reheat temperature has important implications for many
topics in cosmology. We show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
may be produced even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the
freeze-out temperature of the WIMP, and that the dependence of the present
abundance on the mass and the annihilation cross section of the WIMP differs
drastically from familiar results. We revisit predictions of the relic
abundance and resulting model constraints of supersymmetric dark matter,
axions, massive neutrinos, and other dark matter candidates, nucleosynthesis
constraints on decaying particles, and leptogenesis by decay of superheavy
particles. We find that the allowed parameter space of supersymmetric models is
altered, removing the usual bounds on the mass spectrum; the cosmological bound
on massive neutrinos is drastically changed, ruling out Dirac (Majorana)
neutrino masses $m_\nu$ only in the range 33 keV $\simlt m_\nu\simlt$ 6 (5)
MeV, which is significantly smaller from the the standard disallowed range 94
eV $\simlt m_\nu\simlt$ 2 GeV (this implies that massive neutrinos may still
play the role of either warm or cold dark matter); the cosmological upper bound
on the Peccei-Quinn scale may be significantly increased to $ 10^{16}$GeV from
the usually cited limit of about $10^{12}$GeV; and that efficient
out-of-equilibrium GUT baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis can take place even if
the reheat temperature is much smaller than the mass of the decaying superheavy
particle.

Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) -- the `Standard Model' of the Earth's

various quantities characterising the Earth (mass, moment of inertia, normal
mode frequencies etc.)due to the presence of mirror matter. As a result we have
been able to obtain for the first time the direct upper bounds on the possible
concentration of the mirror matter in the Earth. In terms of the ratio of the
mirror mass to the Earth mass a conservative upper bound is $3.8\times
10^{-3}$. We then analysed possible mechanisms (such as lunar and solar tidal
forces, meteorite impacts and earthquakes) of exciting mirror matter
oscillations around the Earth centre. Such oscillations could manifest
themselves through global variations of the gravitational acceleration at the
Earth's surface. We conclude that such variations are too small to be observed.
Our results are valid for other types of hypothetical matter coupled to
ordinary matter by gravitation only (e.g. the shadow matter of superstring
theories).

theory. This result supports the view that we can construct an effective
Abelian gauge theory from QCD without losing characteristic features of the
original non-Abelian gauge theory. In fact, it is shown that the effective
coupling constant in the resulting renormalizable theory has a
renormalization-scale dependence governed by the $\beta$-function that is
exactly the same as that of the original Yang-Mills theory, irrespective of the
choice of gauge fixing parameters of the maximal Abelian gauge and the
parameters used for identifying the dual variables. Moreover, we evaluate the
anomalous dimensions of the fields and parameters in the resultant theory. By
choosing the renormalized parameters appropriately, we can switch the theory
into an electric or a magnetic theory.

invariant for unoriented four-valent graphs embedded in three dimensional
space. It assigns to each embedded graph $G$ a polynomial, denoted $[G]$, in
three variables, $A$, $B$ and $a$, satisfies the skein relation: $$
[\psdiag{2}{6}{overcross}]=A [\psdiag{2}{6}{horlines}]+B
[\psdiag{2}{6}{verlines}]+[\psdiag{2}{6}{vertex}]$$ and is defined in terms of
a state-sum and the Dubrovnik polynomial for links. Using the graphical
calculus of \cite{4} it is shown that the polynomial of a planar graph can be
calculated recursively from that of planar graphs with less vertices, which
also allows the polynomial of an embedded graph to be calculated without
resorting to links. The same approach is used to give a direct proof of
uniqueness of the (normalized) polynomial restricted to planar graphs. In the
case $B=A^{-1}$ and $a=A$, it is proved that for a planar graph $G$ we have
$[G]=2^{c-1}(-A-A^{-1})^v $, where $c$ is the number of connected components of
$G$ and $v$ is the number of vertices of $G$. As a corollary, a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition is obtained for an embedded graph to be ambient
isotopic to a planar graph.

the lattice into its lattice of filters or lattice of ideals, thereby possibly
converting a covering which is not regular into a covering which is regular.
One application of the theory is a generalization of the notion of chief
factors, and of the Jordan-Holder Theorem, to cases where the modular lattice
in question is of infinite height. Another application is a formalization of
the notion of the steps in the proof of a theorem.

the universal regime of large $x$ and large $t$ the limiting distribution is
the Fredholm determinant with Airy kernel. In the exceptional case, called the
critical regime, the limiting distribution seems not to have previously
occurred. The proofs use the dual RSK algorithm, Gessel's theorem, the
Borodin-Okounkov identity and a novel, rigorous saddle point analysis. In the

formulas. A random k-SAT formula is the conjunction of m random clauses, each
of which is the disjunction of k literals (a variable or its negation). It is
known that when the number of variables n is large, there is a sharp transition
from satisfiability to unsatisfiability; in the case of 2-SAT this happens when
m/n --> 1, for 3-SAT the critical ratio is thought to be m/n ~ 4.2. The
sharpness of this transition is characterized by a critical exponent, sometimes
called \nu=\nu_k (the smaller the value of \nu the sharper the transition).
Experiments have suggested that \nu_3 = 1.5+-0.1, \nu_4 = 1.25+-0.05,
\nu_5=1.1+-0.05, \nu_6 = 1.05+-0.05, and heuristics have suggested that \nu_k
--> 1 as k --> infinity. We give here a simple proof that each of these
exponents is at least 2 (provided the exponent is well-defined). This result
holds for each of the three standard ensembles of random k-SAT formulas: m
clauses selected uniformly at random without replacement, m clauses selected
uniformly at random with replacement, and each clause selected with probability
p independent of the other clauses. We also obtain similar results for
q-colorability and the appearance of a q-core in a random graph.

important universal behavior of robustness of supersensitivity, resonance and

While intermittent loss of synchronization may be harmful to application of
high-quality synchronization of coupled chaotic systems, the features reported
here may lead to interesting application of on-off intermittency.

  Huntsville)","Relativity as the quantum mechanics of space-time measurements","17 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Can a simple microscopic model of space and time demonstrate Special
Relativity as the macroscopic (aggregate) behavior of an ensemble ? The
question will be investigated in three parts. First, it is shown that the
Lorentz transformation formally stems from the First Relativity Postulate (FRP)
{\it alone} if space-time quantization is a fundamental law of physics which
must be included as part of the Postulate. An important corollary, however, is
that when measuring devices which carry the basic units of lengths and time
(e.g. a clock ticking every time quantum) are `moving' uniformly, they appear
to be measuring with larger units. Secondly, such an apparent increase in the
sizes of the quanta can be attributed to extra fluctuations associated with
motion, which are precisely described in terms of a thermally agitated harmonic
oscillator by using a temperature parameter. This provides a stringent
constraint on the microscopic properties of flat space-time: it is an array of
quantized oscillators. Thirdly, since the foregoing development would suggest
that the space-time array of an accelerated frame cannot be in thermal
equilibrium, (i.e. it will have a distribution of temperatures), the approach
is applied to the case of acceleration by the field of {\it any} point object,
which corresponds to a temperature `spike' in the array. It is shown that the
outward transport of energy by phonon conduction implies an inverse-square law
of force at low speeds, and the full Schwarzschild metric at high speeds. A
prediction of the new theory is that when two inertial observers move too fast
relative to each other, or when fields are too strong, anharmonic corrections
will modify effects like time dilation, and will lead to asymmetries which
implies that the FRP may not be sustainable in this extreme limit.
