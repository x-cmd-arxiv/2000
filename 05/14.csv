corresponding to self-gravitating gaseous cores embedded within a finite
density envelope of overall cylindrical symmetry. These structures may be
members of a fragmentation hierarchy proceeding from sheets, to filaments, to
elongated, prolate clumps. The embedded solutions are the first of their kind,
and as such represent a significant improvement upon the isolated cloud
paradigm used almost exclusively by previous authors. The properties of the
equilibria are in reasonable agreement with observations of dense molecular
cores in star-forming clouds, despite the fact that there is only one free
parameter in the models. We show that this parameter may be identified with the
critical wavelength for instability in the parent filament. The implications of
further fragmentation and the possible influence of magnetic fields are briefly
discussed.

with the energy above 100keV from two bright Gamma-ray bursts detected by the
PHEBUS instrument of the GRANAT orbital observatory. We show that the light
curves of GRB910402 and GRB920723 events present the afterglow emission with
fading fluxes. During our observations ~700s for these gamma-ray bursts the
afterglow emission was fading as the power law of time with indices equal to
-0.70+/-0.04 and -0.60+/-0.05 (at 1sigma confidence level). In both cases just
after the end of the GRB event we observed the energy spectrum of the afterglow
emissions which was softer than the energy spectrum of the main GRB events. The
average photon index of the main GRB event (in 100-800keV range) is equal to
\~1.5. In the beginning of the afterglow emission the energy spectra of both
events correspond to the much softer spectra with the photon index of ~2.5. We
found that the times of abrupt softening of the burst spectra correspond within
statistical errors to the moment when the afterglow emission begins to dominate
over GRB emission. We found that during the afterglow emission of GRB910402 the
statistically significant hardening of its spectra was observed. This is the
first observation of hardening of GRB afterglow emission. Analysis of GRB910402
and its afterglow showed that this GRB source emits during ~700s of our
observations in soft gamma-rays (100-500keV) only ~1.6% of its total energy
released during the main event. For the GRB920723 we found that in afterglow
during ~700s of our observations ~6% of the GRB total energy was released.

galaxy parameters. The models are used to generate broad band colours from

generate a grid of model galaxies and select only those which lie in regions of
parameter space covered by the sample. The data are consistent with the
proposition that the star formation history of a region within a galaxy depends
primarily on the local surface density of the gas but that one or two
additional ingredients are required to fully explain the observational data.
The observed age gradients appear steeper than those produced by the density
dependent star formation law, indicating that the star formation law or infall
history must vary with galactocentric radius. Furthermore, the
metallicity-magnitude and age-magnitude correlations are not reproduced by a
local density dependence alone. These correlations require one or both of the
following: (i) a combination of mass dependent infall and metal enriched
outflow, or (ii) a mass dependent galaxy formation epoch. Distinguishing these
possibilities on the basis of current data is extremely difficult.

extended colour field, we derive a compact diagrammatic and explicitly colour
trivial expression for the N-th order term of the kt-differential gluon
radiation cross section in an expansion in the opacity of the medium. Resumming
this quantity to all orders in opacity, we obtain Zakharov's path-integral
expression (supplemented with a regularization prescription). This provides a
new proof of the equivalence of the BDMPS and Zakharov formalisms which extends
previous arguments to the kt-differential cross section. We give explicit
analytical results up to third order in opacity for both the gluon radiation
cross section of free incoming and of in-medium produced quarks. The N-th order
term in the opacity expansion of the radiation cross section is found to be a
convolution of the radiation associated to N-fold rescattering and a
readjustment of the probabilities that rescattering occurs with less than N
scattering centers. Both informations can be disentangled by factorizing out of
the radiation cross section a term which depends only on the mean free path of
the projectile. This allows to infer analytical expressions for the totally
coherent and totally incoherent limits of the radiation cross section to
arbitrary orders in opacity.
