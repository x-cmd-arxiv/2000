calculated the distribution of the mass flux and the wind velocity from the

terminal velocity in the equatorial region but hardly affects the wind velocity
from the poles; it enhances the mass flux from the poles while the mass flux
from the equator remains nearly the same. These effects increase with
increasing rotation rates.
  We also calculated models with a bi-stability jump around 25 000 K, using
force multipliers recently calculated with a Monte Carlo technique. In this
case the mass flux increases drastically from the pole to the equator and the
terminal velocity decreases drastically from pole to equator. This produces a
density contrast in the wind rho(equator/pole) of about a factor 10 independent
of the rotation rate of the star. We suggest that the observed density contrast
of a factor 100 of the disks of B[e] stars may be reached by taking into
account the wind compression due to the trajectories of the gas above the

neutron stars assuming that the dipolar magnetic field is confined to the
crust. Our treatment, for the first time, uses a fully general relativistic
formalism not only for the thermal but also for the magnetic part, and includes
partial general relativistic effects in the rotational part. Due to the fact
that the combined evolution depends crucially upon the compactness of the star,
three different equations of state have been employed in the calculations. In
the absence of general relativistic effects, while upon increasing compactness
a decrease of the crust thickness takes place leading into an accelerating
field decay, the inclusion of general relativistic effects intend to
``decelerate this acceleration''. As a consequence we find that within the
crustal field hypothesis, a given equation of state is compatible with the
observed periods $P$ and period derivative $\dot P$ provided the initial field
strength and current location as well as the magnitude of the impurity content
are constrained appropriately. Finally, we access the flexibility of the soft,
medium and stiff classes of equations of state as candidates in describing the
state of the matter in the neutron star interiors. The comparison of our model
calculations with observations, together with the consideration of independent
information about neutron star evolution, suggests that a not too soft equation
of state describes neutron star interiors and its cooling proceeds along the

polarimetry of the GG Tau circumbinary ring. We find that the ring displays

irregularities, but is smoother than suggested by ground-based adaptive optics
observations. The data are consistent with a 37 deg system inclination and a
projected rotational axis at a position angle of 7 deg east of north,
determined from millimeter imaging. The ring is strongly polarized, up to 50%,
which is indicative of Rayleigh-like scattering from sub-micron dust grains.
Although the polarization pattern is broadly centrosymmetric and clearly
results from illumination of the ring by the central stars, departures from
true centrosymmetry and the irregular flux suggest that binary illumination,
scattering through unresolved circumstellar disks, and shading by these disks,
may all be factors influencing the observed morphology. We confirm a 0.25
arcsec shift between the inner edges of the NIR and millimeter images and find
that the global morphology of the ring and the polarimetry provide strong
evidence for a geometrically thick ring. A simple Monte Carlo scattering
simulation is presented which reproduces these features and supports the thick
ring hypothesis. We cannot confirm filamentary streaming from the binary to the
ring, also observed in the ground-based images, although it is possible that
there is material inside the dynamically cleared region which might ontribute
to filamentary deconvolution artifacts. Finally, we find a faint 5th point

show that the model with a long star formation time-scale (~20 Gyr) is
inconsistent with observations. Thus, some mechanisms of reducing the mass of
interstellar medium, such as the consumption of molecular gas by star formation
and/or reheating from supernovae, are certainly effective in galaxies. Our
model predicts that star formation induced when galaxies in a halo collide each
other reduces the cold gas left until the present. However, we find that the
reduction through random collisions of satellite (non-central) galaxies in mean
free time-scale in a halo is not required to explain the observations. This may
imply that the collisions and mergers between satellite galaxies do not occur
so often in clusters or that they do not stimulate the star formation activity
as much as the simple collision model we adopted. For cD galaxies, the
predicted detection rate of cold gas is consistent with observations as long as
the transformation of hot gas into cold gas is prevented in halos whose
circular velocities are larger than 500 km s^-1. Moreover, we find that the
cold gas brought into cDs through captures of gas-rich galaxies is little. We
also show that the fraction of galaxies with observable cold gas should be
small for cluster ellipticals in comparison with that for field ellipticals.

real, suggesting a real spread in metallicity. We estimate the lower and upper

Galactic star clusters and theoretical isochrones. Assuming an old population,
we find that, in the halo field of NGC 5128 we surveyed, stars have

is established. Applying a Bethe-Salpeter model including spectator quark
interactions and a QCD sum rule estimate of the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$
transition form factor which satisfy the spectator quark model bound we predict
the exclusive/inclusive ratio of semileptonic $\Lambda_b$ decay rates to lie in
a range between 0.81 and 0.92. We also provide an upper bound on the baryonic
Isgur-Wise function which is determined from the requirement that the exclusive
rate should not exceed the inclusive rate.

obtained through a classical reduction of the $sl(2)^{(1)}$ affine two-loop
WZNW model. After spontaneously broken the conformal symmetry by means of BRST
analysis, we end up with an effective theory, the so called affine Toda model
coupled to the matter (ATM). Further, using a bosonization technique we recover
from this theory the sine-Gordon model plus a free massless scalar field. The
ATM model is considered as a QCD-motivated integrable field theory, since it
describes various features in the baryonic sector of the low-energy effective
Lagrangian of QCD in two dimensions with one flavor and two colors. Imposing
the equivalence of the Noether and topological currrents as a constraint, it is
shown that the intercharge ``quark''- ``anti-quark'' static potential reveals a
linear confinement behavior for large intercharge separation.

that T=1 and T=0 pair-modes decouple in the exact calculations with the T=1
pair-energy being independent of the T=0 pair-strength and vice-versa. In the
rotating-field, the isoscalar correlations remain constant in contrast to the
well known quenching of isovector pairing. An increase of the isoscalar (J=1,

strength between laser field and ionic core changes. We find around Z=12
typical multiphoton dynamics and for Z=3 tunneling behaviour, however with
clear relativistic signatures. In first order in v/c the magnetic field
component of the laser field induces a Z-dependent drift in the laser
propagation direction and a substantial Z-dependent angular momentum with
repect to the ionic core. While spin oscillations occur already in first order
in v/c as described by the Pauli equation, spin induced forces via spin orbit
coupling only appear in the parameter regime where (v/c)^2 corrections are
significant. In this regime for Z=12 ions we show strong splittings of resonant
spectral lines due to spin-orbit coupling and substantial corrections to the
conventional Stark shift due to the relativistic mass shift while those to the
Darwin term are shown to be small. For smaller charges or higher laser
intensities, parts of the electronic wavepacket may tunnel through the
potential barrier of the ionic core, and when recombining are shown to give
rise to keV harmonics in the radiation spectrum. Some parts of the wavepacket
do not recombine after ionisation and we find very energetic electrons in the
