of LBGs descendents are statistically indistinguishable from those of the
average galaxy population inside the cluster, suggesting that the orbits of
these galaxies are not significantly affected by dynamical friction decay after

resolution the predicted spectral lines tend to be too narrow, reflecting
insufficient Doppler broadening from the convective motions, while at the
currently highest affordable resolution the line shapes have converged
essentially perfectly to the observed profiles. Similar conclusions are drawn
from the line asymmetries and shifts. In terms of abundances, weak FeI and FeII
lines show a very small dependence (~0.02 dex) while for intermediate strong
lines with significant non-thermal broadening the sensitivity increases (~0.10
dex). Problems arise when using 2D convection simulations to describe an
inherent 3D phenomenon, which translates to inaccurate atmospheric velocity
fields and temperature and pressure structures. In 2D the theoretical line
profiles tend to be too shallow and broad compared with the 3D calculations and
observations, in particular for intermediate strong lines. In terms of
abundances, the 2D results are systematically about 0.1 dex lower than for the

fitting formulae. The amplitudes of the mass functions decrease with z, but,
contrary to naive expectation, the comoving density of halos of a fixed
velocity ~200 km/s actually increases out to z=5. This is because high-z halos
are denser, so a fixed velocity corresponds to a smaller mass. The slope of the
velocity function at z=0 is as steep as ~ -4, and the mass and velocity
functions of distinct halos steepen with increasing z, while the functions of
subhalos do not steepen with $z$, and become even flatter at z>2. A simple
observable prediction is that the slope of the velocity function of isolated

then they give afterglow emission through synchrotron radiation. Up to now
synchrotron radiation is believed to be the main mechanism of GRB emission,
however, here we will show that under some circumstances, the inverse Compton

selected from a B_J=23.5 multicolour survey of two 5 degree by 5 degree fields
located at high galactic latitudes. The galaxy catalogue of approximately
400,000 galaxies is comparable in size to catalogues used to determine the
galaxy correlation function at low-redshift. Measurements of the z=0.4
correlation function at large angular scales show no evidence for a break from
a power law though our results are not inconsistent with a break at >15 Mpc.
Despite the large fields-of-view, there are large discrepancies between the
measurements of the correlation function in each field, possibly due to dwarf
galaxies within z=0.11 clusters near the South Galactic Pole.
  Colour selection is used to study the clustering of galaxies z=0 to z=0.4.
The galaxy correlation function is found to strongly depend on colour with red
galaxies more strongly clustered than blue galaxies by a factor of 5 at small
scales. The slope of the correlation function is also found to vary with colour
with gamma=1.8 for red galaxies while gamma=1.5 for blue galaxies. The
clustering of red galaxies is consistently strong over the entire magnitude
range studied though there are large variations between the two fields. The
clustering of blue galaxies is extremely weak over the observed magnitude range
with clustering consistent with r_0=2 Mpc. This is weaker than the clustering
of late-type galaxies in the local Universe and suggests galaxy clustering is
more strongly correlated with colour than morphology. This may also be the
first detection of a substantial low redshift galaxy population with clustering
properties similar to faint blue galaxies.

numerical model of the star formation allows us to follow the evolution of the
blastwaves due to supernovae in the inhomogeous, multi-phase, and
turbulent-like media self-consistently. Formation of kpc-scale inhomogeneity,
such as cavities, observed HI map of the LMC, is suppressed by frequent
supernovae (average supernova rate for the whole disk is ~0.001/yr). However
the supernova explosions are necessary for the hot component (T_g > 10^{6-7}
K). Position-velocity maps show that kpc-scale shells/arcs formed through the
nonlinear evolution in a model without stellar energy feedback has similar
kinematics to explosional phenomena, such as supernovae. We also find that
dense clumps and filamentary structure are formed due to a natural consequence
of the non-linear evolution of the multi-phage ISM. Although the ISM in a small
scale looks turbulent-like and transient, the global structure of the ISM is
quasi-stable. We compare the observations of HI and molecular gas of the LMC
with the numerically obtained HI and CO map. The morphology and statistical
properties of the numerical HI and CO maps are discussed.

determining the observational consequences for such systems. The disc wobbles
with a period approximately equal to half the binary's orbital period and
precesses on a longer timescale. We determine the characteristic timescale for
realignment of the disc with the orbital plane due to dissipation. If the
dissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in line
with previous studies, that the alignment timescale is of order the viscous
evolution timescale. However, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if the
disc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced shearing
within the disc is transonic. In general, hydrodynamic instabilities associated
with the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation which is expected
to drastically reduce the alignment timescale. For large disc tilts the
alignment timescale is then comparable to the precession timescale, while for
smaller tilt angles $\delta$, the alignment timescale varies as $(\sin
\delta)^{-1}$. We discuss the consequences of the wobbling, precession and
rapid realignment for observations of protostellar jets and the implications

redshift of the largest ""Lyman-break galaxy"" (LBG) samples. Because we link the
star formation timescale to the local gas density, the rate at which a galaxy
forms stars is governed mainly by the rate at which it accretes cooled gas from
the surrounding medium. At z=3, star formation in most of the simulated
galaxies is steady on 200 Myr timescales, and the instantaneous star formation
rate (SFR) is correlated with total stellar mass. However, there is enough
scatter in this correlation that a sample selected above a given SFR threshold
may contain galaxies with a fairly wide range of masses. The redshift history
and global density of star formation in the simulations depend mainly on the
amplitude of mass fluctuations in the underlying cosmological model. The three
models whose mass fluctuation amplitudes agree with recent analyses of the
Lyman-alpha forest also reproduce the observed luminosity function of LBGs
reasonably well, though the dynamic range of the comparison is small and the
theoretical and observational uncertainties are large. The models with higher
and lower amplitudes appear to predict too much and too little star formation,
respectively, though they are not clearly ruled out. The intermediate amplitude
models predict SFR ~ 30-40 Msun/yr for galaxies with a surface density 1 per

numerical model simulates the conductive properties of a cellular material by a
two-dimensional array of biological cells. The application of an external field
in the form of the idealised square pulse sequence with a pulse duration
$t_{i}$, and a pulse repetition time $\Delta t$ is assumed. The simulation
model includes the known mechanisms of temporal and spatial evolution of the
conductive properties of different microstructural elements in a tissue. The
kinetics of breakage at different values of electric field strength $E$,
$t_{i}$ and $\Delta t$ was studied in experimental investigation. We propose
the hypothesis for the nature of tissue properties evolution after PEF
treatment and consider this phenomena as a correlated percolation, which is
governed by two key processes: resealing of cells and moisture transfer
processes inside the cellular structure. The breakage kinetics was shown to be
very sensitive to the repetition times $\Delta t$ of the PEF treatment. We
observed correlated percolation patterns in a case when $\Delta t$ exceeds the
characteristic time of the processes of moisture transfer and random
percolation patterns in other cases. The long-term mode of the pulse repetition
times in PEF treatment allows us to visualize experimentally the macroscopic
percolation channels in the sample.

flow conditions is investigated using a hydrodynamic lattice gas model. After
the validation of the model in simple cases (Poiseuille flow, Darcy's law for
single component fluids), attention is focussed on the properties of binary
immiscible fluids in porous media. An extension of Darcy's law which explicitly
admits a viscous coupling between the fluids is verified, and evidence of
capillary effects are described. The influence of a third component, namely
surfactant, is studied in the same context. Invasion simulations have also been
performed. The effect of the applied force on the invasion process is reported.
As the forcing level increases, the invasion process becomes faster and the
residual oil saturation decreases. The introduction of surfactant in the
invading phase during imbibition produces new phenomena, including
emulsification and micellisation. At very low fluid forcing levels, this leads
to the production of a low-resistance gel, which then slows down the progress
of the invading fluid. At long times (beyond the water percolation threshold),
the concentration of remaining oil within the porous medium is lowered by the
action of surfactant, thus enhancing oil recovery. On the other hand, the
introduction of surfactant in the invading phase during drainage simulations
slows down the invasion process -- the invading fluid takes a more tortuous
path to invade the porous medium -- and reduces the oil recovery (the residual
oil saturation increases).

achieve remarkably low values for transport coefficients, such as viscosity.
Indeed, the lowest such attainable values are limited only by considerations of

high-Reynolds number simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.

action in weak background fields. We perform DVV reduction to the multiple
D0-brane action in order to find the Matrix string theory action for multiple
fundamental strings in curved but weak NS-NS and R-R backgrounds. This matrix
sigma model gives a definite prescription on how to deal with R-R fields with
an explicit spacetime dependence in Type II string theory. We do this both via
the 9-11 flip and the chain of T and S dualities, and further check on their
equivalence explicitly. In order to do so, we also discuss the implementation
of S-duality in the operators of the 2-dimensional world-volume supersymmetric
gauge theory describing the Type IIB D-string. We compare the result to the
known Green-Schwarz sigma model action (for one string), and use this
comparison in order to discuss about possible, non-linear background curvature
corrections to the Matrix string action (involving many strings), and therefore
to the Matrix theory action. We illustrate the nonabelian character of our
action with an example involving multiple fundamental strings in a non-trivial
R-R flux, where the strings are polarized into a noncommutative configuration.
This corresponds to a dielectric type of effect on fundamental strings.

1-branes and 5-branes. Momentum is allowed to flow in the direction along the
1-branes so that the moduli space has only 1/8 of the full supersymmetry.
Relative to the more familiar case with the 1-branes delocalized along the
5-branes, this introduces new moduli associated with the motion of the 1-branes
along the 5-branes. We consider in detail the moduli space metric for the
associated two body problem. Even for motion transverse to the 5-brane, our
results differ substantially from the delocalized case. However, this
difference only appears when both the 1-brane charge and the momentum charge
are localized. Despite the fact that, in a certain sense, 1-branes
spontaneously delocalize near a 5-brane horizon, the moduli space metric in
this limit continues to differ from the delocalized result. This fact may be of
use in developing a new description of the associated BPS bound states. The new
terms depend on the torus size $L$ in such a way that they give a finite
contribution in the $L \to \infty$ limit.

combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude
estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply
amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish
to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal
quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.

(MKC) exhibit a novel kind of contextuality, which we term existential
contextuality. In this phenomenon it is not simply the pre-existing value but
the actual existence of an observable which is context dependent. This result
confirms the point made elsewhere, that the MKC models do not, as the authors
claim, ``nullify'' the Kochen-Specker theorem. It may also be of some
independent interest.

which a qubit is regarded as the superposition of ground states in each dot.
Coherent control on the qubit is performed by both a frequency and a
polarization of a monochromatic light pulse illuminated on the quantum dots. We
also show that a simple combination of two single qubit gates functions as a
controlled NOT gate resulting from an electron-electron interaction. To examine
the decoherence of quantum states, we discuss electronic relaxation contributed
mainly by LA phonon processes.

operations, classical communication and shared entanglement (LOCCSE). Lower
bounds on the necessary entanglement and classical communication are determined
using causality and the linearity of quantum mechanics. We examine in
particular detail the resources required if the remote control is to be
implemented as a classical black box. Under these circumstances, we prove that
the required resources are, necessarily, those needed for implementation by
bidirectional state teleportation.

regime where the density matrix is entangled.
