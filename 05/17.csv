powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of spiral arm modulation in stellar
disks. Spiral arm modulation may be understood in terms of interference
patterns of outgoing and incoming density wave packets or modes. The brightness
along a spiral arm will be increased where two wave crests meet and
constructively interfere, but will be decreased where a wave crest and a wave
trough destructively interfere. Spiral arm modulation has hitherto only been
detected in grand design spirals (such as Messier 81). Spiral arm amplitude
variations have the potential to become a powerful constraint for the study of
galactic dynamics. We illustrate our method in two galaxies: NGC 4062 and NGC
5248. In both cases, we have detected trailing and leading m=2 waves with
similar pitch angles. This suggests that the amplification mechanism is the
WASER type II. In this mechanism, the bulge region reflects (rather than
refracts) incoming waves with no change of pitch angle, but only a change of
their sense of winding. The ratio between the amplitudes of the leading and the
trailing waves is about 0.5 in both cases, wherein the higher amplitude is
consistently assigned to the trailing (as opposed to leading) mode. The results
are particularly significant because NGC 5248 is an optically grand design
galaxy, whereas NGC 4062 is optically flocculent. NGC 4062 represents the very
first detection of spiral arm modulation in the stellar disk of an optically
flocculent galaxy.

  issue of the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/301520",,"astro-ph",,"  Since the discovery of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in many
galaxies (LINERs), it has been recognized that they constitute a class of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which are thought to be powered by gas accretion
onto a central, supermassive black hole. LINERs are observed in approximately
one third of galaxies in the local universe and it has been often thought that
they harbor an AGN-like central engine with moderate activity. However, some
LINERs show no direct evidence for AGNs such as broad emission lines, radio
jets, hard X-ray emission, spectral energy distributions which are inconsistent
with starlight, and so on. For such LINERs (a subset of type 2 LINERs), we
present new poststarburst models which explain some of their most important
optical narrow emission-line ratios. In these models, the ionization sources
are planetary nebula nuclei (PNNs) with temperature of ~ 10^5 K which appear in
the late-phase evolution of intermediate-mass stars with mass between ~ 3
M_solar and ~ 6 M_solar. Such PNNs left in a typical starburst nucleus can
produce an Halpha luminosity of L(Halpha) ~ 10^38 ergs s^-1 for typical
poststarburst LINERs and ~ 10^39 ergs s^-1 only in exceptionally bright cases.
The PNN phase lasts until the death of the lowest-mass stars formed in the
starburst, which is ~ 5 x 10^8 yr for an assumed lower limit of the initial
mass function of 3 M_solar. This long duration appears consistent with the
observed higher frequency of occurrence of LINERs if every galaxy could
experience the starburst activity several times in its life. We therefore
propose that some LINERs which show no direct evidence for AGNs may be
poststarburst nuclei powered by a cluster of PNNs.

binary systems comprised of early-type primaries and late-type secondaries. The
ages of the systems were determined by Lindroos (1985) from uvbybeta photometry

secondaries are physically bound to the early-type primaries, they could be
Post-T Tauri stars (PTTS). We have found strong X-ray emission from several
secondaries. This fact together with their optical and IR data, make them bona

early-type primaries and, in particular, from most of the late-B type stars.
Because their HRI hardness ratios are similar to those from resolved late-type

of this emission.

derived from the spherical model(beta = 0.96_-0.22^+0.48) and the elliptical
model (beta = 0.73+/-0.18) are consistent. We derived the gas mass and total
mass of the cluster from the betamodel fit and the previously published ASCA
temperature (12.3^{+3.1}_{-2.2} keV). The gas mass fraction at the virial
radius is fgas = (14[-3,+2.5]+/-3)% for Omega_0=1, where the errors in brackets
come from the uncertainty on the temperature and the remaining errors from the
HRI imaging data. The gas mass fraction computed for the best fit ASCA
temperature is significantly lower than found for nearby hot clusters,
fgas=20.1pm 1.6%. This local value can be matched if the actual virial
temperature of MS1054-032 were close to the lower ASCA limit (~10keV) with an
even lower value of 8 keV giving the best agreement. Such a bias between the
virial and measured temperature could be due to the presence of shock waves in
the intracluster medium stemming from recent mergers. Another possibility, that
reconciles a high temperature with the local gas mass fraction, is the

between Ba and Pb agrees well with a scaled solar system s-process component,
while the lighter elements (Sr-Zr) are less abundant than Ba. The enhancement
of s-process elements is interpreted as a result of mass transfer in a binary
system from a previous AGB companion, an interpretation strongly supported by
radial velocity variations of this system.
  The detection of Pb makes it possible, for the first time, to compare model
predictions of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars with observations of
elements between Sr and Pb. The Pb abundance is significantly lower than the
prediction of recent models (e.g., Gallino et al. 1998), which succeeded in
explaining the metallicity dependence of the abundance ratios of light
s-elements (Sr-Zr) to heavy ones (Ba-Dy) found in previously observed
s-process-enhanced stars. This suggests that one should either (a) reconsider
the underlying assumptions concerning the 13C-rich s-processing site

  From the comparison of these evolutionary synthesis models with a compilation
of elliptical galaxy data from the literature, we find that the observed CaT
index follows the blue <Fe> index rather than Mg2 as the models predict. If
this implies an over-abundance [Mg/Ca] and we take into account the masses of
stars which produce Mg and Ca, these stars could form in a time scale shorter
than 5 Myr from the beginning of the star formation process. Alternatively, an
IMF biased towards very massive stars (M > 40 Msun) at the early epoch of star
formation in elliptical nuclei has to be assumed. We also suggest to revise the
calculation of the nucleosynthesis yield of Magnesium.

excitations. We review recent work introducing a 2+1 dimensional boundary
conformal field theory for the damping of the phi_{alpha} excitations by
non-magnetic impurities, which is built on the proximity to a magnetic ordering
transition at which the phi_{alpha} condense; the results are compared with
neutron scattering experiments. Photoemission and THz conductivity measurements
indicate that the nodal quasiparticles undergo strong inelastic scattering at
low temperatures; we propose that this is due to fluctuations near a quantum
phase transition, and critically analyze candidate order parameters and field
theories.

light of the behavior of the archetype of these systems: the molecular complex
Mn12-ac. Most observations can be understood in the framework of the reduced
Hilbert space dimension 2S+1=21. Due to the large spin S=10, the energy barrier
preventing spin rotation is large, and as a consequence, quantum relaxation is
very slow. The application of a magnetic field of a few Tesla below 1 K allows
to observe tunneling (i) between the states m=-10 and m=10-n with n=8 to 11 if
the field is longitudinal, or (ii) between the two ground-states m~-10 and m~10
if the field is transverse. The crossover temperature between ground-state and
thermally assisted tunneling in a longitudinal field extrapolates in zero field
at ~1.7 K. The observation of square root relaxation at
short-times/low-temperatures and of exponential relaxation at
long-times/high-temperatures, as observed previously above 1.5 K, confirms the
important role of the spin bath dynamics which is out of equilibrium in the
first regime and at equilibrium in the second one. In a second part of this
paper a new molecule, so-called V15, with resultant spin S=1/2 is investigated.
Contrary to high spin molecules, the energy barrier of low spin molecules is
small or null, and the splitting between the symmetrical and anti-symmetrical
states is sufficiently large to allow spin-phonon transitions during spin
rotation. In low spin molecules the coupling to the environment is quite
different from the one found in large spin molecules in low fields.

superfluid $^4$He decayed even at mK temperatures where the normal fluid was
negligible and no mutual friction worked. Motivated by this experiment, this
work studies numerically the dynamics of the vortex tangle without the mutual
friction, thus showing that a self-similar cascade process, whereby large
vortex loops break up to smaller ones, proceeds in the vortex tangle and is
closely related with its free decay. This cascade process which may be covered
with the mutual friction at higher temperatures is just the one at zero
temperature Feynman proposed long ago. The full Biot-Savart calculation is made
for dilute vortices, while the localized induction approximation is used for a
dense tangle. The former finds the elementary scenario: the reconnection of the
vortices excites vortex waves along them and makes them kinked, which could be
suppressed if the mutual friction worked. The kinked parts reconnect with the
vortex they belong to, dividing into small loops. The latter simulation under
the localized induction approximation shows that such cascade process actually
proceeds self-similarly in a dense tangle and continues to make small vortices.
Considering that the vortices of the interatomic size no longer keep the
picture of vortex, the cascade process leads to the decay of the vortex line
density. The presence of the cascade process is supported also by investigating
the classification of the reconnection type and the size distribution of
vortices. The decay of the vortex line density is consistent with the solution
of the Vinen's equation which was originally derived on the basis of the idea
of homogeneous turbulence with the cascade process. The obtained result is
compared with the recent Vinen's theory.

has revealed, for the first time, distinct spectra from the two subtly
inequivalent rare-earth sites in the orthorhombic unit cell. Because of the
non-colinear spin structure of HoF$_3$, the NMR and magnetometry measurements
give independent and complimentary information about the ionic moments.
  (3) The measured hyperfine splittings have been interpreted in terms of a
15-parameter crystal-field Hamiltonian appropriate to the $C_{1h}$ site
symmetry. This work has entailed a substantial effort to clarify the notational
confusion that exists in the literature. A computer program has been developed
to automate conversion between notational conventions prior to diagonalization
of the 136-dimensional electronic-nuclear Hamiltonian comprising the Zeeman,
crystal-field and hyperfine interactions.

thermodynamics, the buoyant force by black hole atmosphere (the acceleration
radiation) plays an important role, and then it is significant to understand
the nature of the buoyant force.
  Recently, Bekenstein criticizes that the fluid approximation of the
acceleration radiation which is often used in the estimation of the buoyant
force is invalid for the case that the size of the target is much less than a
typical wavelength of the acceleration radiation, due to the diffractive effect
of wave scattering.
  In this letter, we argue that even if it is correct that we should calculate
the buoyant force as a wave scattering process, its implication in the GSL
strongly depends on whether there exists any massless scalar field, that is,
S-wave scattering. By reconsidering the diffractive effect by S-wave
scattering, we show that if some massless scalar field exists, then the GSL can
hold without invoking a new physics, such as an entropy bound for matter.

3-dimensional projective space or 3-sphere, a new integer-valued characteristic
is introduced. It is invariant under rigid isotopy and multiplied by -1 under
mirror reflections. In a sense, it is a Vassiliev invariant of degree 1 and a
counterpart of a link diagram writhe. For a regular complete intersection this
invariant vanishes, while for rational knots of degree d it takes all the

temperature-dependent effective classical potential governing the quantum
statistics of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic at all temperatures. The
zero-temperature limit yields the binding energy of the electron which is quite
accurate for all magnetic field strengths and exhibits, in particular, the
correct logarithmic growth at large fields.

Rekdal","Macroscopic Interference Effects in Resonant Cavities","20 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1238/Physica.Regular.063a00316","CERN-TH/99-412","quant-ph",,"  We investigate the possibility of interference effects induced by macroscopic
quantum-mechanical superpositions of almost othogonal coherent states - a
Schroedinger cats state - in a resonant microcavity. Despite the fact that a
single atom, used as a probe of the cat state, on the average only change the
mean number of photons by one unit, we show that this single atom can change
the system drastically. Interference between the initial and almost orthogonal
macroscopic quantum states of the radiation field can now take place.
Dissipation under current experimental conditions is taken into account and it
is found that this does not necessarily change the intereference effects
dramatically.
