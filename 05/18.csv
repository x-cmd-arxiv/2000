resolution, the structure of dusty circumstellar disks with embedded planets.
We emphasize some testable implications of our simulations which would verify
the presence of a planet via thermal emission of one or more dusty clumps which
are in mean motion resonances with the planet. In particular, our simulations
indicate that Vega may have a massive planet of m~2 m_J (m_J being Jupiter's
mass) at a distance of 50-60 AU, and Epsilon Eri may have a less massive planet
of m~0.2 m_J at a similar distance of 55-65 AU. This conclusion is testable:
Each resonant feature is stationary in the reference frame co-rotating with the
planet, but it is not so for the observer at Earth. Therefore, if our
interpretation of asymmetric clumps in circumstellar disks as dynamical
resonant structures is correct, the above pattern revolves around the star with
an angular velocity of (1.2-1.6) deg/yr (Vega) and (0.6-0.8) deg/yr (Epsilon
Eri) -- a prediction that can be tested on a timescale of several years.

associated with their relatives among the fundamental pulsators, known as

explanation for the well-known ``polarization hole'' effect, in which the

polarization from the ``backbone'' of poloidal flux along the filament's axis
and its surrounding envelope, which is dominated by the toroidal field
component. A systematic exploration of our parameter space allows us to
classify the polarization patterns due to filaments aligned approximately
perpendicular to the plane of the sky into three basic types. The polarization
vectors are parallel to filaments when $\ratio\appleq 0.1$, where $\Bzs$ and
$\Bphis$ are respectively the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components

perpendicular to filaments when $\ratio\appgeq 0.33$. Intermediate cases result
in polarization patterns that contain $90^\circ$ flips in the orientation of

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A study of the absorption systems toward the gravitationally lensed quasar
APM 08279+5255 is presented. Most of the MgII systems in the redshift range
1.2-2.07, although saturated, show large residuals at the bottom of the lines.
The most likely interpretation is that individual clouds within MgII halos do
cover only one of the two brightest QSO images. This reveals that MgII halos
are made of a collection of clouds of radius smaller than about 1 kpc. Two
strong MgII absorbers at z = 1.062 and 1.181 are studied in detail. This is the
first time that the NaI3303 doublet is detected in such high redshift systems.
Together with the detection of the MgI2852 transition, this strongly constrains
the physical characteristics of the gas. The N(NaI)/N(MgI) ratio is found to be
larger than unity, implying that the gas is cool and neutral. The column
densities of NaI, CaII, MgI, TiII, MnII and FeII observed at z = 1.1801 are
very close to that observed along the line of sight towards 23 Ori in our
Galaxy. The shape of the QSO continuum and the relative depletion of Fe, Ti, Mn
and Ca are consistent with the presence of dust at z = 1 (AV = 0.5 mag).
Altogether it is found that the HI column density at z = 1 is of the order of 1
to 5 10**21 cm-2, the corresponding metallicity is in the range 1--0.3 Zsol.
The objects associated with these two systems could both contribute to the lens
together with another possible strong system at z = 1.1727 and the strong
Lyman-alpha system at z = 2.974. The probable damped Ly-alpha system at z =
2.974 has 19.8 < log N(HI) < 20.3. The transverse dimension of the absorber is
larger than 200 pc. Abundances relative to solar are -2.31, -2.26, -2.10, -2.35
and -2.37 for, respectively, Fe, Al, Si, C and O (for log N(HI) = 20.3).

gravity to include charges. Under suitable coordinate conditions and boundary
conditions the determining equation of the Hamiltonian (a kind of
transcendental equation) is derived from the matching conditions for the
dilaton field at the particles' position. The canonical equations of motion are
derived from this determining equation.
  For the equal mass case the canonical equations in terms of the proper time
can be exactly solved in terms of hyperbolic and/or trigonometric functions. In
electrodynamics with zero cosmological constant the trajectories for repulsive
charges exhibit not only bounded motion but also a countably infinite series of
unbounded motions for a fixed value of the total energy $H_{0}$, while for
attractive charges the trajectories are simply periodic. When the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ is introduced, the motion for a given $\Lambda$ and $H_{0}$
is classified in terms of the charge-momentum diagram from which we can predict
what type of the motion is realized for a given charge.
  Since in this theory the charge of each particle appears in the form
$e_{1}e_{2}$ in the determining equation, the static balance condition in 1+1
dimensions turns out to be identical with the condition in Newtonian theory. We
generalize this condition to non-zero momenta, obtaining the first exact
solution to the static balance problem that does not obey the

For three model solar magnetic field profiles that produce the best fits of the
previous data we calculate the charged current event rate, the (neutral
current)/(charged current) event ratio and the charged current electron
spectrum as well as its first and second moments. We study the dependence of
the calculated observables on the choice of the magnetic field profile and on
the value of the solar $hep$ neutrino flux. We also compare our results with
those obtained assuming that the solar neutrino problem is due to neutrino
oscillations in vacuum or in matter. We show that there is an overlap or
partial overlap between our predictions and those found for each of the
oscillation solutions (SMA, LMA, LOW and VO). Given the uncertainties in the
calculations and the expected uncertainties in the experimental results, the
unambiguous discrimination between the two types of solutions to the solar
neutrino problem (neutrino oscillations and magnetic moments) on the basis of
the average rates and electron spectrum distortions appears to be difficult.
The possible time dependence of the charged current signal and spectrum
distortion in the case of the magnetic moment solution therefore remains the
best hope for such a discrimination. For a hybrid solution (neutrino magnetic
moment plus flavour mixing) the smoking gun signature would be an observation
of $\bar{\nu}_e$'s from the sun.

142 is studied by using a first-principles constant-energy molecular dynamics
simulation method. Na_142, whose atoms are distributed in two (surface and
inner) main shells with different radial distances to the center of mass of the
cluster, melts in two steps: the first one, at approx. 130 K, is characterized
by a high intrashell mobility of the atoms, and the second, homogeneous
melting, at approx. 270 K, involves diffusive motion of all the atoms across
the whole cluster volume (both intrashell and intershell displacements are
allowed). On the contrary, the melting of Na_92 proceeds gradually over a very
wide temperature interval, without any abrupt step visible in the thermal or
structural melting indicators. The occurrence of well defined steps in the
melting transition is then shown to be related to the existence of a
distribution of the atoms in shells. Thereby we propose a necessary condition
for a cluster to be considered rigorously amorphouslike (totally disordered),
namely that there are no space regions of the cluster where the local value of
the atomic density is considerably reduced. Na_92 is the only cluster from the
two considered that verifies this condition, so its thermal behavior can be
considered as representative of that expected for amorphous clusters. Na_142,
on the other hand, has a discernible atomic shell structure and should be
considered instead as just partially disordered. The thermal behavior of these
two clusters is also compared to that of icosahedral (totally ordered) sodium
clusters of the same sizes.

pseudo-pure states to mimic the evolution and observations on true pure states.
A new method of preparing pseudo-pure states is described, which involves the
selection of the spatially labeled states of an ancilla spin with which the
spin system of interest is correlated. This permits a general procedure to be
given for the preparation of pseudo-pure states on any number of spins, subject
to the limitations imposed by the loss of signal from the selected subensemble.
The preparation of a single pseudo-pure state is demonstrated by carbon and
proton NMR on 13C-labeled alanine. With a judicious choice of magnetic field
gradients, the method further allows encoding of up to 2^N pseudo-pure states
in independent spatial modes in an N+1 spin system. Fast encoding and decoding
schemes are demonstrated for the preparation of four such spatially labeled
pseudo-pure states.
