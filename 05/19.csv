  of 4U 0614+09 binary","13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publications in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/312759",,"astro-ph",,"  The recently formulated Two Oscillator (TO) model interprets the lowest of
the kilohertz frequencies of the twin peak quasi-periodic oscillations in X
-ray binaries as the Keplerian frequency nu_K. The high twin frequency nu_h in
this model holds the upper hybrid frequency relation to the rotational
frequency of the neutron star's magnetosphere Omega: nu_h^2=nu_K^2+
4(Omega/2pi)^2. The vector Omega is assumed to have an angle delta with the
normal to the disk. The first oscillator in the TO model allows one to
interpret the horizontal branch observed below 100 Hz as the lower mode of the
Keplerian oscillator under the influence of the Coriolis force, with frequency
nu_L being dependent on nu_h, nu_K and delta. For some stars such as 4U
0614+09, Sco X-1 and 4U 1702-42, nu_h, nu_K and nu_L have been observed
simultaneously providing the opportunity to check the central prediction of the
TO model: the constancy of delta for a particular source. Given the
considerable variation of each of these three frequencies, the existence of an
observational invariant with a clear physical interpretation as a global
parameter of the neutron star magnetosphere is an important test of the TO
model. Using the results of recent observations of 4U 0614+09 we verify the
existence of this invariant and determine the angle delta=15^o.6+/- 0.^o5 for
this star. The second oscillator in the model deals with a radial (presumably
sound) oscillation and diffuse process in the viscous layer surrounding the
neutron star. Our analysis of the viscous oscillation frequency nu_V and the
break frequency nu_b of the diffusion shows that the spin value of the inner
boundary of the transition layer for 4U 0614+09 is at least two times more than
values for 4U 1728-34 and Sco X-1.

6.2micron Unidentified Infrared Band (UIB) and the MIR continuum shows that
UIBs are very faint or absent in regions harboring the intense and hard
radiation fields of AGNs and pure HII regions, where the UIB carriers could be
destroyed. The MIR signature of AGNs is the presence of an important continuum
in the 3-10micron band which originates from very hot dust heated by the
intense AGN radiation field. Using these two distinct spectral properties found
in our MIR templates, we build diagnostic diagrams which provide quantitative
estimates of the AGN, PDR and HII region contribution in a given MIR spectrum.
This new MIR classification can be used to reveal the presence of AGNs highly
obscured by large columns of dust.

spinning neutron stars with differential rotation. We perform fully
relativistic 3D simulations of compact stars with $M/R \geq 0.1$, where $M$ is
the total gravitational mass and $R$ the equatorial circumferential radius. We
adopt an adiabatic equation of state with adiabatic index $\Gamma=2$. As in
Newtonian theory, we find that stars above a critical value of $\beta \equiv
T/W$ (where $T$ is the rotational kinetic energy and $W$ the gravitational
binding energy) are dynamically unstable to bar formation. For our adopted
choices of stellar compaction and rotation profile, the critical value of
$\beta = \beta_{dGR}$ is $\sim 0.24-0.25$, only slightly smaller than the
well-known Newtonian value $\sim 0.27$ for incompressible Maclaurin spheroids.
The critical value depends only very weakly on the degree of differential
rotation for the moderate range we surveyed. All unstable stars form bars on a
dynamical timescale. Models with sufficiently large $\beta$ subsequently form
spiral arms and eject mass, driving the remnant to a dynamically stable state.
Models with moderately large $\beta \gtrsim \beta_{dGR}$ do not develop spiral
arms or eject mass but adjust to form dynamically stable ellipsoidal-like
configurations. If the bar-mode instability is triggered in supernovae collapse
or binary neutron star mergers, it could be a strong and observable source of
gravitational waves. We determine characteristic wave amplitudes and
frequencies.

no optical transient for GRB 990506 was detected in spite of numerous searches.
The cause of the unusually rapid onset of the decay for the afterglow is
probably the result of an isotropically energetic fireball expanding into a low

a faint (R ~ 24 mag) host galaxy with a double morphology.

been detected in 57% (17 of 30) of LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts, at least
15 of which have a flat to inverted radio spectrum (alpha > -0.3). The compact
radio cores are found in both type 1 (i.e. with broad Halpha) and type 2
(without broad Halpha) nuclei. The 2 cm radio power is significantly correlated
with the emission-line ([OI] lambda6300) luminosity. While the present
observations are consistent with the radio emission originating in star-forming
regions, higher resolution radio observations of 10 of the detected sources,
reported in a companion paper (Falcke et al. 2000), show that the cores are
very compact (< pc), of high brightness temperature (T(b) >= 10^8K) and
probably synchrotron self-absorbed, ruling out a starburst origin. Thus, our
results suggest that at least 50% of low-luminosity Seyferts and LINERs in the

jets or advection-dominated accretion flows. We have detected only 1 of 18

two brightest sources we detect some extended emission, which appears to
originate in jets in at least one of these galaxies. Together with the spectral
indices this suggests that the nuclear emission at centimeter radio waves is
largely dominated by emission from radio jets, very similar to the situation in
more luminous AGN. The energy released in these jets could be a significant
fraction of the energy budget in the accretion flow.

of the shear signal recently reported by several groups engaged in weak lensing

separation. With this simplifying, but not necessarily realistic assumption
(halo shapes as a proxy for galaxy shapes), we find a positive detection of
correlations up to scales of at least 20 h^-1mpc (limited by the box size). The
signal is not strongly affected by variations in the halo finding technique, or
by the resolution of the simulations. We translate our 3d results into angular
measurements of ellipticity correlation functions and shear variance which can
be directly compared to observations. We also measure similar results from
simulated angular surveys made by projecting our simulation boxes onto the
plane of the sky and applying a radial selection function. Interestingly, the
shear variance we measure is a small, but not entirely negligible fraction
(from ~10-20 %) of that seen by the observational groups, and the ellipticity
correlation functions approximately mimic the functional form expected to be
caused by weak lensing. The amplitude depends on the width in redshift of the
galaxy distribution. If photometric redshifts are used to pick out a screen of
background galaxies with a small width, then the intrinsic correlation may
become comparable to the weak lensing signal. Although we are dealing with
simulated dark matter halos, whether there is a signal from real galaxies could
be checked with a nearby sample with known redshifts.

[OIII]5007 emission, thought to be an isotropic property. However, recent
studies of radio-loud AGN have questioned the isotropy of [OIII] emission and
concluded that [OII]3727 emission is isotropic. In this paper we investigate
the relation between eigenvector 1 and [OII] emission in radio-quiet BQS

not drive eigenvector 1. The luminosities and equivalent widths of [OIII] and
[OII] correlate with one another, and the range in luminosities and equivalent

free of orientation dependent dust effects and ionization dependent effects in

beam has an energy flux large enough, the U band brightening and, in
particular, the U-B colour are roughly comparable with observed values for a
typical large flare. Moreover, for electron beams with a moderate energy flux,
a decrease of the emission at the Paschen continuum appears. This can explain
at least partly the continuum dimming observed in some stellar flares. Adopting
an atmospheric model for the flaring state can further raise the continuum flux
but it yields a spectral colour incomparable with observations. This implies
that the nonthermal effects may play the chief role in powering the continuum

at all wavelengths in all the quasars in our sample, while only $\sim$ 50% of
the galaxies have detected cores in at least one wavelength. The degree of core
prominence in this sample is consistent with the unified scheme for radio

spectral index of the cores in our sample of lobe-dominated quasars (LDQs) with
a matched sample of core-dominated quasars (CDQs) shows that the distributions
for these two classes are significantly different, consistent with the

the two hotspots on opposite sides are also significantly larger for quasars
than radio galaxies, as expected in the unified scheme. We also investigate the
relationship between the spectral index of the hotspots and redshift or

exclude the cosmologically significant extinction either by the reddening check

the case of ordinary dust that reddens. Then we discuss two theoretical
possibilities that high-z supernovae have larger extinction and hence they are
fainter than local supernovae: the intergalactic dust and host galaxy

supernovae with improved photometric accuracy are required to reject these

jet component becomes optically thick for synchrotron self-absorption, by
extending the method originally developed by Reynolds et al. The general
condition gives a lower limit of the electron number density, with the aid of
the surface brightness condition, which enables us to compute the magnetic
field density. Comparing the lower limit with another independent constraint
for the electron density that is deduced from the kinetic luminosity, we can
distinguish the matter content. We apply the procedure to the five components
of 3C345 (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C7) of which angular diameters and radio fluxes
at the peak frequencies were obtainable from literature. Evaluating the
representative values of Doppler beaming factors by their equipartition values,

cluster population down to the present-day based on the model in which star
formation is truncated when the galaxies infall from the surrounding field.
  We show that the blue galaxies are incorporated into the present-day tight CM
relation as they fade and become redder after the truncation, which is possibly
responsible for producing faint S0's (>M*+1). Truncation of star formation is,
however, found to be relatively milder (with a time scale of 1 Gyr) than
suggested by the viorent processes such as ram-pressure stripping and/or
mergers/harassment.
  The BO effect is after all found to be a combination of three effects,
namely, increasing field star formation activity, increasing galaxy infall
rate, and the truncatin of star formation after the accretion. Our approach
naturally leads to the history of galaxy assembly and `global' star foramtion
for `cluster' galaxies.

supernova remnant (SNR) at a distance of at least 17 kpc that has been long

X-ray emission from the SNR. The X-ray source is faint with an observed flux of
(6.0 +/- 0.8)E-13 erg/s/cm^2 over the 2-10 keV band. The emission is heavily
cut-off at low energies and no flux is detected below 2 keV. Spectral analysis
confirms that the column density to the source is indeed large, N_H ~ 1E23
atoms/cm^2, and consistent with the total column density of hydrogen through
the Galaxy at this position. Good fits to the spectrum can be obtained for
either thermal plasma or nonthermal power-law models, although the lack of
detected line emission as well as other evidence argues against the former
interpretation. The power-law index we find, \alpha_P = 2.9 (+0.9,-0.8), is
consistent with other Crab-like SNRs. In the radio band G328.4+0.2 is nearly as

moving on tadpole orbits. Our survey of in-plane test particles near the

inclination test particles do not persist, as their inclinations are quickly
increased until the effects of a secular resonance with Jupiter cause

Here we generalize the RPA to nonuniform systems. This gives the long-range
behavior of the inhomogeneous two-body correlation term and provides an
accurate analytic expression for the one-body term. It also explains why
Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions incorporating determinants of Hartree-Fock

RPA Jastrow factor. After adjusting the inhomogeneous RPA Jastrow factor to
incorporate the known short-range behavior, we test it using variational Monte

does not necessarily require a conformation change of the polyelectrolyte

dominated by Debye-Huckel--like charge-charge correlations as well as by
correlations between dissociation sites along the polymer chain. We show that
the one-loop corrections to the free energy lead to titration curves that agree
with experiments. In particular, the model explains the decrease of the pH at
the plateau when the polymer concentration is increased or when salt is added

ceramics was investigated under different ac drive voltages. It was observed
that: (i) the dielectric permittivity is independent on ac field amplitude at
high temperatures; (ii) with increasing ac drive, the permittivity maximum
increases, and the temperature of the maximum shifts to lower temperature;
(iii) the nonlinear effect is weakened when the measurement frequency
increases. The influences of increasing ac drive were found to be similar to
that of decreasing frequency. It is believed that the dielectric nonlinearities
of relaxors at low drives can be explained by the phase transition theory of
ergodic space shrinking in succession. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed
on the flips of micro polarizations at low ac drives to verify the theory.

rods, allowing for polydispersity in the lengths of the rods. In spite of the
simplified nature of the model (rods are restricted to lie along one of three
orthogonal axes), the results agree qualitatively with experimental
observations: the coexistence region broadens significantly as the
polydispersity increases, and strong fractionation occurs, with long rods found
preferentially in the nematic phase. These conclusions are obtained from an
analysis of the exact phase equilibrium equations. In the second part of the
paper, we consider the application of the recently developed ``moment free
energy method'' to the polydisperse Zwanzig model. Even though the model
contains non-conserved densities due to the orientational degrees of freedom,
most of the exactness statements (regarding the onset of phase coexistence,
spinodals, and critical points) derived previously for systems with conserved
densities remain valid. The accuracy of the results from the moment free energy
increases as more and more additional moments are retained in the description.
We show how this increase in accuracy can be monitored without relying on
knowledge of the exact results, and discuss an adaptive technique for choosing
the extra moments optimally.

the solution represented by string modes from the pure algebraic approach.
However in the path integral representation it is easy transforming those
algebraic equations into the differential equations which can be solved.
Another purpose of this paper is to try to explore an open question. we do not
know how to construct an exact theory of D-branes in the general background
until now. However many recent researches show the boundary state description
indeed seizes some fundamental features of D-branes in the rather special

introduced in the path integral representation, we argue that path integral
representation of the boundary state should provide an exact description of D
branes in the general backgrounds.

that operator entanglement for all quantum observables in the Poincare algebra,

super-structure is known as a Naimark extension. The required entanglement
between particle generations for left-handed quarks is observed in the

of directed, random networks. We center our investigations on the scaling of
the length of sub-basin's dominant stream with its area, a characterization of
basin shape known as Hack's law. We generalize this relationship to a joint
probability density and show that fluctuations about scaling are substantial.
We find strong deviations from scaling at small scales which can be explained
by the existence of linear network structure. At intermediate scales, we find
slow drifts in exponent values indicating that scaling is only approximately
obeyed and that universality remains indeterminate. At large scales, we observe
a breakdown in scaling due to decreasing sample space and correlations with
overall basin shape. The extent of approximate scaling is significantly
restricted by these deviations and will not be improved by increases in network
resolution.

  Number","16 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables, Revtex4, submitted to PRE",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.63.016116",,"physics.geo-ph",,"  The structure of a river network may be seen as a discrete set of nested
sub-networks built out of individual stream segments. These network components
are assigned an integral stream order via a hierarchical and discrete ordering
method. Exponential relationships, known as Horton's laws, between stream order
and ensemble-averaged quantities pertaining to network components are observed.
We extend these observations to incorporate fluctuations and all higher moments
by developing functional relationships between distributions. The relationships
determined are drawn from a combination of theoretical analysis, analysis of
real river networks including the Mississippi, Amazon and Nile, and numerical
simulations on a model of directed, random networks. Underlying distributions
of stream segment lengths are identified as exponential. Combinations of these
distributions form single-humped distributions with exponential tails, the sums
of which are in turn shown to give power law distributions of stream lengths.
Distributions of basin area and stream segment frequency are also addressed.
The calculations identify a single length-scale as a measure of size
fluctuations in network components. This article is the second in a series of
three addressing the geometry of river networks.

  Connectivity","16 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, Revtex4, submitted to PRE",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.63.016117",,"physics.geo-ph",,"  River networks serve as a paradigmatic example of all branching networks.
Essential to understanding the overall structure of river networks is a
knowledge of their detailed architecture. Here we show that sub-branches are
distributed exponentially in size and that they are randomly distributed in
space, thereby completely characterizing the most basic level of river network
description. Specifically, an averaged view of network architecture is first
provided by a proposed self-similarity statement about the scaling of drainage
density, a local measure of stream concentration. This scaling of drainage
density is shown to imply Tokunaga's law, a description of the scaling of side
branch abundance along a given stream, as well as a scaling law for stream
lengths. This establishes the scaling of the length scale associated with
drainage density as the basic signature of self-similarity in river networks.
We then consider fluctuations in drainage density and consequently the numbers
of side branches. Data is analyzed for the Mississippi River basin and a model
of random directed networks. Numbers of side streams are found to follow
exponential distributions as are stream lengths and inter-tributary distances
along streams. Finally, we derive the joint variation of side stream abundance
with stream length, affording a full description of fluctuations in network
structure. Fluctuations in side stream numbers are shown to be a direct result
of fluctuations in stream lengths. This is the last paper in a series of three
on the geometry of river networks.

is investigated. The results from the classical hierarchy of density matrices
are compared with the results from the quantum kinetic theory. The kinetic
theory yields a systematic treatment of the nonlinear current beyond linear
response. To this end the dynamically screened and field-dependent
Lenard-Balescu equation is integrated analytically and the nonlinear relaxation
field is calculated. The classical linear response result known as Debye -
Onsager relaxation effect is only obtained if asymmetric screening is assumed.
Considering the kinetic equation of one specie the other species have to be
screened dynamically while the screening with the same specie itself has to be
performed statically. Different other approximations are discussed and
compared.
