  dwarfs","3 pages, latex, 2 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A Letters",,,"preprint UAO-139","astro-ph",,"  An apparent Ca underabundance for cool metal rich disk dwarfs was derived by
Feltzing & Gustafsson (1998, A&AS, 129, 237). This was suggested to be a NLTE
effect, following the prediction by Drake (1991, MNRAS, 251, 369). New NLTE
calculations with MARCS atmospheres and opacities (Thor\'en, P., 2000, A&A, in
preparation) show that deviations from LTE are very small and can not explain
the underabundance. It is shown that the underabundance was primarily due to
erroneously calculated atomic line broadening parameters (van der Waals
broadening). Part of the underabundance was also due to the decision not to
change photometrically determined stellar parameters to satisfy the Fe I
excitation balance.

populated with values to create initial conditions. These orbits are
re-simulated to check that they are stable and then re-sampled every 2.5 years

concentration of objects on the sky occurs close to the classical Lagrange
points at heliocentric ecliptic longitudes of 60 and 300 degrees. The
distributions are broad especially if horseshoes are present in the sample. The
full-width half maximum (FWHM) in heliocentric longitude for Venus is 325
degrees and for the Earth is 328 degrees. The mean and most common velocity of
these coorbiting satellites coincides with the mean motion of the parent
planet, but again the spread is wide with a FWHM for Venus of 27.8 arcsec/hr

the sky occurs at heliocentric ecliptic latitudes of 12 degrees. The peak of
the velocity distribution occurs at 65 arcsec/hr, significantly less than the
Martian mean motion, while its FWHM is 32.3 arcsec/hr. The case of Mercury is

z=5.80 discovered from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multicolor imaging data.
This object was selected as an i'-band dropout object, with i*=21.8 +/- 0.2,
z*=19.2 +/- 0.1. It has an absolute magnitude M1450 = -27.2 (H_0 =50 km/s/Mpc,
q0 = 0.5). The spectrum shows a strong and broad Ly alpha emission line, strong
Ly alpha forest absorption lines with a mean continuum decrement D_A = 0.91,
and a Lyman Limit System at z=5.72. The spectrum also shows strong OI and SiIV
emission lines similar to those of quasars at z<= 5, suggesting that these
metals were produced at redshift beyond six. The lack of a Gunn-Peterson trough
in the spectrum indicates that the universe is already highly ionized at z ~
5.8. Using a high-resolution spectrum in the Ly alpha forest region, we place a
conservative upper limit of the optical depth due to the Gunn-Peterson effect
of tau < 0.5 in regions of minimum absorption. The Ly alpha forest absorption
in this object is much stronger than that in quasars at z<= 5. The object is
unresolved in a deep image with excellent seeing, implying that it is unlensed.
The black hole mass of this quasar is ~3 x 10^9 M_solar if we assume that it is
radiating at the Eddington luminosity and no lensing amplification, implying
that it resides in a very massive dark matter halo. The discovery of one quasar
at M_1450 < -27 in a survey area of 600 deg^2 is consistent with an
extrapolation of the observed luminosity function at lower redshift. The
abundance and evolution of such quasars can provide sensitive tests of models
of quasar and galaxy formation.

secondary muons >0.1 GeV and measures their angles to 0.26 deg (projected angle

angular information, and spectral index were extrapolated to GRAND's energy

predicted. A product of extrapolated flux and GRAND's detection sensitivity
yields an overall parameter indicating GRAND's relative sensitivity to each

the standard afterglow shock model. Here we propose a non-standard model for
the unusual R-band afterglow of GRB 000301c. In this model, an
ultra-relativistic shock in a dense medium (""dirty environment"")rapidly evolved
to the non-relativistic phase in initial 1 day. During such a phase, the shock
happened to be caught up with by two energetic shells ejected from the central
engine at two different times, and the shock was refreshed, leading to two
flattenings of the light curve. After each interaction between the shock and
shell, the afterglow decayed as $\propto t^{-3.0}$ if the electron distribution
index of the shocked medium, $p\approx 3.4$, derived from the optical spectrum.
Therefore, this model can provide an excellent explanation for the flattening
and steepening features of the GRB 000301c optical afterglow light curve. We
further point out that the energy injection shells ejected from the central
engine at later times may be material shells (e.g., in the massive star
progenitor models related to black holes) or radiation shells (e.g., in the
millisecond pulsar progenitor models).

we study a recently defined [3, 8, 9] condition called locally nonconical
convexity (abbreviated LNC). Is is easy to show that every strictly convex set
is LNC, as are half-spaces and finite intersections of sets of either of these
types, but many more sets are LNC. For instance, every zonoid (the range of a
nonatomic vector-valued measure) is LNC (Corollary 34). However, there are no
infinite-dimensional compact LNC sets (Theorem 23).
  The LNC concept originated in a search for continuous sections, and the
present paper shows how it leads naturally (and constructively) to continuous
sections in a variety of situations. Let Q be a compact, convex set in R^n, and
let T be a linear map from R^n into R^m. We show (Theorem 1) that Q is LNC if
and only if the restriction of any such T to Q is an open map of Q onto T(Q).
This implies that if Q is LNC, then any such T has continuous sections (i.e.
there are continuous right inverses of T) that map from T(Q) to Q, and in fact
it is possible to define continuous sections constructively in various natural
ways (Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Theorem 5). If Q is strictly convex and T is
not 1-1, we can construct continuous sections which take values in the boundary
of Q (Theorem 6).
  When we give up compactness it is natural to consider a closed, convex, LNC
subset Q of a Hilbert space X which may be infinite-dimensional. In this case
we must assume that T is left Fredholm, i.e. a bounded linear map with closed
range and finite-dimensional kernel. We can then prove results analogous to
those mentioned in the last paragraph (Theorems 16-20). We also prove that T(Q)
is LNC (Theorem 25).

associated a Lie group $G$ and a representation $\rho$ of that group. The group
is determined from the Weierstrass model, which has singularities that are
generically rational double points; these double points lead to local factors
of $G$ which are either the corresponding A-D-E groups or some associated
non-simply laced groups.
  The representation $\rho$ is a sum of representations coming from the local
factors of $G$, and of other representations which can be associated to the
points at which the singularities are worse than generic.
  This construction first arose in physics, and the requirement of anomaly
cancellation in the associated physical theory makes some surprising
predictions about the connection between $X$ and $\rho$. In particular, an
explicit formula (in terms of $\rho$) for the Euler characteristic of $X$ is
predicted. We give a purely mathematical proof of that formula in this paper,
introducing along the way a new invariant of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. We
also verify the other geometric predictions which are consequences of anomaly
cancellation, under some (mild) hypotheses about the types of singularities
which occur.
  As a byproduct we also discover a novel relation between the Coxeter number
and the rank in the case of the simply laced groups in the ``exceptional

Poincare duality for this manifold implies the generalized Dehn-Sommerville
equations for the number of faces of simplicial manifolds.

analytical expressions for translationally invariant one- and two-point
cumulants in logarithmic field amplitudes. Such cumulants make it possible to
distinguish between hitherto equally successful cascade generator models and
hence supplement lowest-order multifractal scaling exponents and multiplier
distributions.

gauge field theories. The main problem we face is to uphold a strong and
meaningful criterion of what is physical. We like to call it ""Field's dilemma"",
referring to Hartry Field's nominalist proposal which we consider to be
inadaequate. The resolution to the dilemma, we believe, is implicitly provided
by the so-called fiber bundle formalism. We shall demonstrate, in detail, that
the bundle structure underlying modern quantum and gravitational gauge field
theories allows for a genuine distinction between the physically significant
and the merely mathematical parts of these theories.

into account that for quantum systems the only feature known before an
experiment is performed are the probabilities for various events to occur. The
sum of the individual measures of information for mutually complementary
observations is invariant under the choice of the particular set of
complementary observations and conserved if there is no information exchange
with an environment. That operational quantum information invariant results in
N bits of information for a system consisting of N qubits.

precise measurements. The force is calculated at finite temperature for
multilayered covering of the bodies using the Lifshitz theory. We argue that
the dielectric function of the metallization has to be directly measured to
reach the necessary precision in the force calculation. Without knowledge of
this function one can establish a well defined upper limit on the force using
parameters of perfect single-crystal materials. The force measured in the
torsion pendulum experiment does not contradict to the upper limit. Importance
of a thin Au/Pd layer in the atomic force microscope experiments is stressed.
The force measured with the microscope is larger than the upper limit at small
separations between bodies. The discrepancy is significant and reproduced for
both performed measurements. The origin of the discrepancy is discussed. The
simplest modification of the experiment is proposed allowing to make its
results more reliable and answer the question if the discrepancy has any
relation with the existence of a new force.
