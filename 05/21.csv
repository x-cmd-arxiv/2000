disordered wires in a magnetic field. In contrast to a recent supersymmetry
approach our numerical results show that the decay rate of the steady state
changes {\em smoothly} at the crossover from preserved to broken time-reversal
symmetry. Scaling and fluctuation properties are also analyzed and a formula,
which was derived analytically only in the pure symmetry cases is shown to
describe also the steady state wavefunction at the crossover regime. Finally,
we present a scaling for the variance of the packet which shows again a smooth
transition due to the magnetic field.

and gravity appear in low energy corner together with corresponding symmetries,
including Lorentz symmetry and local SU(N). This supports idea that quantum
field theory (Standard Model or GUT) is effective theory describing low-energy
phenomena. * Momentum space topology of fermionic vacuum provides topological
stability of universality class of systems, where above properties appear. *
BCS scheme for 3He-A incorporates both ``relativistic'' infrared regime and
ultraviolet ``transplanckian'' range: subtle issues of cut-off in quantum field
theory and anomalies can be resolved on physical grounds. This allows to
separate ``renormalizable'' terms in action, treated by effective theory, from
those obtained only in ``transPlanckian'' physics. * Energy density of
superfluid vacuum within effective theory is ~ E_{Planck}^4. Stability analysis
of ground state beyond effective theory leads to exact nullification of vacuum
energy: equilibrium vacuum is not gravitating. In nonequilibrium, vacuum energy
is of order energy density of matter. * 3He-A provides experimental prove for
anomalous nucleation of fermionic charge according to Adler-Bell-Jackiw. *
Helical instability in 3He-A is described by the same equations as formation of
magnetic field by right electrons in Joyce-Shaposhnikov scenario. * Macroscopic
parity violating effect and angular momentum paradox are both desribed by axial
gravitational Chern-Simons action. * High energy dispersion of quasiparticle
spectrum allow to treat problems of vacuum in presence of event horizon, etc.

the thermalized QGP phase of QCD. The hadronization of the thermalized QGP
phase is given in a way resembling a coalescence model with correlated quarks
and anti-quarks. The input parameters of the approach are the spatial volumes
of the hadronization. We introduce three dimensionless parameters C_M, C_B and
C_\bar{B} related to the spatial volumes of the production of low-lying mesons
(M), baryons (B) and antibaryons (\bar{B}). We show that at the temperature T=
175 MeV our predictions for the ratios of multiplicities agree good with the
presently available set of hadron ratios measured for various experiments given
