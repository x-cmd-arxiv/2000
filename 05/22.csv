weak microlensing is considered. This means that the weak microlensing leads to
distortion of the distance scale. It is shown that the distortions to appear

multiple X-ray observations, in particular, a variable high-energy tail of the
synchrotron radiation is revealed. The X-ray spectral analysis provides further
evidence of the synchrotron nature of its broad-band spectrum: a steep and
downward curving spectrum between 0.1--10 keV, typical of high-energy peaked BL
Lacs (HBL). The spectral energy distribution (SED) through radio-to-X-ray
yields the synchrotron radiation peak at frequency Vp=7.3 10^{15} Hz, with
integrated luminosity of Lsyn=2.1 10^{44} ergs s^{-1}. The averaged SED
properties of PKS 2316-423 are very similar to those ``intermediate'' BL Lac
objects (IBL) found recently in several deep surveys, such as Deep X-ray Radio
Blazar, Radio-Emitting X-ray, and ROSAT-Green Bank surveys. We suggest that PKS
2316-423 is an IBL though it also shows some general features of a HBL.

The SZ effect, alongwith X-ray observations of clusters, is used to determine
the Hubble constant, $H_{\circ}$. Blank sky surveys of SZ effect are being
planned to constrain the geometry of the universe through cluster counts. It is
also known that a significant fraction of clusters has cooling flows in them,
which changes the pressure profile of intracluster gas. Since the SZ decrement
depends essentially on the pressure profile, it is important to study possible
changes in the determination of cosmological parameters in the presence of a
cooling flow. We build several representative models of cooling flows and
compare the results with the corresponding case of gas in hydrostatic
equilibrium. We find that cooling flows can lead to an overestimation of the
Hubble constant. Specifically, we find that for realistic models of cooling
flow with mass deposition (varying $\dot m$ with radius), there is of the order
$\sim 10 %$ deviation in the estimated value of the Hubble constant (from that
for gas without a cooling flow) even after excluding $ \sim 80 %$ of the
cooling flow region from the analysis. We also discuss the implications of
using cluster counts from SZ observations to constrain other cosmological
parameters, in the presence of clusters with cooling flows.

that the acceleration of the Universe is due to a scalar field whose final
evolution is insensitive to the initial conditions. Within this framework we
investigate the cosmological perturbations for two well-motivated potentials:
the Ratra-Peebles and the SUGRA tracking potentials. We show that the solutions
of the perturbed equations possess an attractor and that, as a consequence, the
insensitivity to the initial conditions is preserved at the perturbed level.
Then, we study the predictions of these two models for structure formation and
CMB anisotropies and investigate the general features of the multipole moments
in the presence of quintessence. We also compare the CMB multipoles calculated
with the help of a full Boltzmann code with the BOOMERanG and MAXIMA-1 data. We
pay special attention to the location of the second peak and demonstrate that
it significantly differs from the location obtained in the cosmological
constant case. Finally, we argue that the SUGRA potential is compatible with
all the recent data with a standard values of the cosmological parameters. In
particular, it fits the MAXIMA-1 data better than a cosmological constant or
the Ratra-Peebles potential.

strong burst observed on August 29, 1998 revealed a number of unique
properties. The burst exhibits a precursor and is followed by a long (~ 1000 s)
tail modulated at the 5.16 s stellar rotation period. The precursor has a
duration of 0.85 s and shows both significant spectral evolution as well as an

continuum variations observed in the X-ray spectra are not detected in the

well-correlated. Variations in the flux of the broad Hbeta line are found to
lag behind the optical continuum variations by 6 days (with an uncertainty of
2-3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a virial mass estimate
of about 1.1 million solar masses, at the very low end of the distribution of
AGN masses measured by line reverberation. Strong variability of He II 4686 is
also detected, and the response time measured is similar to that of Hbeta, but
with a much larger uncertainty. The He II 4686 line is almost five times
broader than Hbeta, and it is strongly blueward asymmetric, as are the
high-ionization UV lines recorded in archival spectra of NGC 4051. The data are
consistent with the Balmer lines arising in a low to moderate inclination
disk-like configuration, and the high-ionization lines arising in an outflowing
wind, of which we observe preferentially the near side. Previous observations
of the narrow-line region morphology of this source suggest that the system is
inclined by about 50 degrees, and if this is applicable to the broad
Hbeta-emitting region, a central mass of about 1.4 million solar masses can be
inferred. During the third year of monitoring, both the X-ray continuum and the
He II 4686 line went into extremely low states, although the optical continuum
and the Hbeta broad line were both still present and variable. We suggest that
the inner part of the accretion disk may have gone into an advection-dominated
state, yielding little radiation from the hotter inner disk.

following properties of the constrained Hamiltonian theory: the diffeomorphisms
are generated by constraints on the phase space so that a) The algebra of the
generators reflects the algebra of the diffeomorphism group. b) The Poisson
brackets of the basic fields with the generators reflects the space-time
transformation properties of these basic fields. This suggests that in a purely
Hamiltonian approach the requirement of diffeomorphism invariance should be
interpreted to include b) and not just a) as one might naively suppose. Giving
up b) amounts to giving up objective histories, even at the classical level.

and optimized renormalization scheme for calculating exclusive processes, which
enables the inclusion of transverse degrees of freedom without entailing
suppression of calculated observables, like form factors. This is achieved by
employing an analytic, i.e., infrared stable, running strong coupling $\alpha
_{\rm s}(Q^{2})$ which removes the Landau singularity at $Q^{2}=\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}^{2}$ by a minimum power-behaved correction. The ensuing contributions to
the cusp anomalous dimension - related to the Sudakov form factor - and to the
quark anomalous dimension - which controls evolution - lead to an enhancement
at high $Q^{2}$ of the hard part of exclusive amplitudes, calculated in
perturbative QCD, while simultaneously improving its scaling behavior. The
phenomenological implications of this framework are analyzed by applying it to
the pion's electromagnetic form factor, including the NLO contribution to the
hard-scattering amplitude, and also to the pion-photon transition at LO. For
the pion wave function, an improved ansatz of the Brodsky-Huang-Lepage type is
employed, which includes an effective (constituent-like) quark mass, $m_{\rm
q}=0.33$ GeV. Predictions for both form factors are presented and compared to
the experimental data, applying Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie commensurate scale
setting. We find that the perturbative hart part prevails at momentum transfers
above about 20 GeV ${}^{2}$, while at lower $Q^{2}$-values the pion form factor
is dominated by Feynman-type contributions. The theoretical prediction for the
$\gamma ^{*}\gamma \to \pi ^{0}$ form factor indicates that the true pion

analysis of quantum spectra and the periodic orbit orbit quantization of
chaotic systems. The harmonic inversion technique circumvents the convergence
problems of the periodic orbit sum and the uncertainty principle of the usual
Fourier analysis, thus yielding results of high resolution and high precision.
Based on the close analogy between periodic orbit trace formulae for regular
and chaotic systems the technique is generalized in this paper for the
semiclassical quantization of integrable systems. Thus, harmonic inversion is
shown to be a universal tool which can be applied to a wide range of physical
systems. The method is further generalized in two directions: Firstly, the
periodic orbit quantization will be extended to include higher order hbar
corrections to the periodic orbit sum. Secondly, the use of cross-correlated
periodic orbit sums allows us to significantly reduce the required number of
orbits for semiclassical quantization, i.e., to improve the efficiency of the
semiclassical method. As a representative of regular systems, we choose the
circle billiard, whose periodic orbits and quantum eigenvalues can easily be
obtained.

structure functions are presented for four-momenta in the range 0.8 \leq Q^{2}
\leq 20 (GeV/c)^{2}. The regions of applicability of the eikonal approximation
are studied and observed to be confined to proton knockout in a relatively
small cone about the momentum transfer. A simple criterium defining the
boundaries of this cone is determined. The Q^2 dependence of the effect of
off-shell ambiguities on the different (e,e'p) structure functions is
addressed. At sufficiently high values of Q^2 their impact on the cross
sections is illustrated to become practically negligible. It is pointed out
that for the whole range of Q^2 values studied here, the bulk of the
relativistic effects arising from the coupling between the lower components in
the wave functions, is manifesting itself in the longitudinal-transverse
interference term.

results on the melting-like transition in sodium clusters of the same sizes.
Melting in potasium and sodium clusters proceeds in a similar way: a surface
melting stage develops upon heating before the homogeneous melting temperature
is reached. Premelting effects are nevertheless more important and more easily
established in potasium clusters, and the transition regions spread over
temperature intervals which are wider than in the case of sodium. For all the
sizes considered, the percentage melting temperature reduction when passing
from Na to K clusters is substantially larger than in the bulk. Once those two
materials have been compared for a number of different cluster sizes, we study
the melting-like transition in Rb_55 and Cs_55 clusters and make a comparison
with the melting behavior of Na_55 and K_55. As the atomic number increases,
the height of the specific heat peaks decreases, their width increases, and the
melting temperature decreases as in bulk melting, but in a more pronounced way.
