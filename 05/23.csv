radius of 350 km instead of only about 240 km as in a comparable calculation
with multi-group flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) by Bruenn, Mezzacappa, & Dineva

accurate transport in our model. Nevertheless, after 180 ms of expansion the
shock finally recedes to a radius around 250 km (compared to about 170 km in
the MGFLD run). The effect of an accurate neutrino transport is helpful, but
not large enough to cause an explosion of the considered 15 solar mass star.
Therefore postshock convection and/or an enhancement of the core neutrino
luminosity by convection or reduced neutrino opacities in the neutron star seem
necessary for neutrino-driven explosions of such stars. We find an electron

photometry of high-z objects that have a known intrinsic spectrum. Observations
of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows appear to support the theoretical model of
an adiabatic blast wave expanding into an external medium. In this model, the
synchrotron peak flux is independent of frequency, providing a flat spectrum
when observed over time, and therefore allowing straightforward measurement of
the relative attenuation of afterglow flux in widely separated bands. Applying
this method to dust extinction, we show that for a sample of afterglows which
have been corrected by galactic extinction, comparison between the number
counts of peak fluxes in X-ray versus optical can provide constraints on an
intergalactic component of dust. A similar technique can probe the
redshift-dependence of extinction in GRB-forming regions without requiring an
assumed relation between extinction and reddening by the dust. Probing
systematic changes in extinction with redshift - particularly in IG and/or

structure formation for two cosmological scenarios (a SCDM and a LCDM with
Omega =1). Large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments and
Galaxy Clusters (GCs) on a scale of circa 5 Mpc/h in both cases. Energetic
motions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetric
inflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about
1 Mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside GCs. Also collisions between substructures
inside GCs form merger shocks. Consequently, the topology of the shocks is very
complex and highly connected. During cosmic evolution the comoving shock
surface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process in
both scenarios. Accretion shocks have very high Mach numbers (10-10^3), when
photo-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. The typical shock speed is
of order v_{sh}(z) =H(z)lambda_{NL}(z), with lambda_{NL}(z) the wavelength
scale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. However, the Mach
number for shocks occuring within clusters is usually smaller (3-10), due to
the fact that the intracluster gas is already hot. Statistical fits of shock
speed around GCs as a function of GCs temperature give power-law's in accord
with 1-D predictions. However, a very different result is obtained for fits of
the shock radius, reflecting the very complex shock structures forming in 3-D
simulations. The in-flowing kinetic energy across such shocks, giving the power
available for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster X-ray
luminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 Mpc/h. Considering their
large size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sites
for cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.

lepton asymmetry and neutrino degeneracy. We show that neutrinos can begin to
decouple at higher temperatures than previous estimates due to several
corrections which diminish the neutrino reaction rate. These decoupled
neutrinos are therefore not heated as the particle degrees of freedom change.
The resultant ratio of the relic neutrino-to-photon temperatures after $e^\pm$
annihilation can then be significantly reduced by more than a factor of two
from that of the standard nondegenerate ratio. This changes the expansion rate
and subsequent primordial nucleosynthesis, photon decoupling, and structure
formation. In particular we analyze physically plausible lepton-asymmetric
models with large $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ degeneracies together with a
moderate $\nu_e$ degeneracy. We show that the nucleosynthesis by itself permits
very large neutrino degeneracies $0 \le \xinum$, $\xinut \le 40$, $0 \le \xinue

accretion is unlikely to occur in equal mass binary systems with moderate (~ 50
AU) semi-major axes. Internal thermal energy generation in the disks is
sufficient to heat the gas everywhere so that spiral structures quickly decay
rather than grow or fragment. This same heating will inhibit dust coagulation
because the temperatures rise above the vaporization temperatures of many
volatile materials. We consider other processes not included in the model and
conclude that our temperatures are conservatively estimated (low), i.e. planet
formation is less likely in real systems than in the model.

come from highly ionized Ca. The emission line is so far only seen in the

fitted with that of thin hot plasma of cosmic abundances except that of Ca,
which is overabundant by a factor of $8 \pm 5$. Assuming that most of Ca is
$^{44}$Ca, which originates from $^{44}$Ti by radioactive decay, we estimate a
total Ca mass of about $1.1\times 10^{-3}M_\odot$. Combining the amount of

relatively long (at least 3.5 min). Analysis of the burst gives clear evidence
for photospheric radius expansion. Assuming the peak luminosity to be close to

stars unless there is a rapid turn-down in the IMF beyond several hundred solar
masses. Such a turndown is not necessary for dense clusters because the number
of stars sampled is always too small. Here we explore several mechanisms for an
upper mass cutoff, including an exponential decline of the star formation
probability after a turbulent crossing time. The results are in good agreement
with the observed IMF over the entire stellar mass range, and they give a
gradual turn down compared to the Salpeter function above ~100 Msun for normal
thermal Jeans mass, M_J. The upper mass turn down should scale with M_J in
different environments. A problem with the models is that they cannot give both
the observed power-law IMF out to the high-mass sampling limit in dense
clusters, as well as the observed lack of supermassive stars in whole galaxy
disks. Either there is a sharper upper-mass cutoff in the IMF, perhaps from
self-limitation, or the IMF is different for dense clusters than for the
majority of star formation that occurs at lower density. Dense clusters seem to
have an overabundance of massive stars relative to the average IMF in a galaxy.

suggest that 28SiO maser emission in the v=4, J=5-4 line, the only one observed

infrared line overlaps successfully explain observed maser emission in the v=0,

$x=0.30$ down to $x=0.05$ even though $T_c$ decreases in the underdoped region,
and the superconducting gap appears to smoothly evolve into the normal-state
gap at $x=0.05$. It is shown that the energy scales characterizing these
low-energy structures have similar doping dependences. For the heavily
overdoped sample ($x=0.30$), the band dispersion and the ARPES spectral
lineshape are analyzed using a simple phenomenological self-energy form, and
the electronic effective mass enhancement factor $m^*/m_b \simeq 2$ has been
found. As the hole concentration decreases, an incoherent component that cannot
be described within the simple self-energy analysis grows intense in the
high-energy tail of the ARPES peak. Some unusual features of the electronic
structure observed for the underdoped region ($x \lesssim 0.10$) are consistent
with the numerical works on the stripe model.

concavity and irreversibility and verifies Khinchin axioms except the one
related to additivity since $S_{\chi}$ is nonextensive. For $1<\chi<2$, the
entropy $S_{\chi}$ becomes superadditive in the thermodynamic limit. The

vector to the four dimensions of spacetime allows a further possibility. If the

elastic matter, the imaginary part of the same equation can describe the
evolution of the electromagnetic field and of its sources. The Hermitian

demonstrate the inherent smooth transition from the 3-flavor to the 4-flavor

order as the conventional NLO $F_2$ calculation in the limit $\frac{Q}{m_c} >>
1$. It includes the resummed large logarithm contributions of the 3-flavor
scheme (generally known in this context as the fixed-flavor-number or FFN

function, comparison with recent HERA data and the existing FFN calculation
reveals that the relatively simple order-$\alpha_s$ (NLO) 4-flavor ($m_c \neq

yielding good agreement with data over the full measured $Q^2$ range. The Monte
Carlo implementation also allows the calculation of differential distributions
with relevant kinematic cuts. Comparisons with available HERA data show
qualitative agreement; however, they also indicate the need to extend the

fermionic mean fields and on the quantum kinetics of the photon and fermion
distribution functions. For semihard photons of momentum eT << k << T we find
to leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with a
power law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density near the
Landau damping threshold. The dynamical renormalization group reveals the
emergence of detailed balance for microscopic time scales larger than 1/k while
the rates are still varying with time. The quantum kinetic equation for the
photon distribution function allows us to study photon production from a
thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by off-shell effects. We find that for a
QGP at temperature T ~ 200 MeV and of lifetime 10 < t < 50 fm/c the hard (k ~

extrapolating low energy physics (both in the matter and gravitational sector)

notion of formal Morita equivalence in the category of $^*$-algebras over a
ring $\ring C$ which is the quadratic extension by $\im$ of an ordered ring
$\ring R$. The goal of the present paper is twofold. First, we clarify the
relationship between formal Morita equivalence, Ara's notion of Morita
$^*$-equivalence of rings with involution, and strong Morita equivalence of
$C^*$-algebras. Second, in the general setting of $^*$-algebras over $\ring C$,
we define `closed' $^*$-ideals as the ones occuring as kernels of
$^*$-representations of these algebras on pre-Hilbert spaces. These ideals form
a lattice which we show is invariant under formal Morita equivalence. This
result, when applied to Pedersen ideals of $C^*$-algebras, recovers the
so-called Rieffel correspondence theorem. The triviality of the minimal element
in the lattice of closed ideals, called the `minimal ideal', is also a formal
Morita invariant and this fact can be used to describe a large class of
examples of $^*$-algebras over $\ring C$ with equivalent representation theory
but which are not formally Morita equivalent. We finally compute the closed
$^*$-ideals of some $^*$-algebras arising in differential geometry.

moving according to a process with symmetric stationary independent increments
and undergoing one and two levels of critical branching. We obtain long time
fluctuation limits for the occupation time process of the one-and two-level
systems. We give complete results for the case of finite variance branching,
where the fluctuation limits are Gaussian random fields, and partial results
for an example of infinite variance branching, where the fluctuation limits are
stable random fields. The asymptotics of the occupation time fluctuations are
determined by the Green potential operator G of the individual particle motion
and its powers $G^2, G^3$, and by the growth as $t\to\infty$ of the operator
$G_t=\int^t_0T_sds$ and its powers, where $T_t$ is the semigroup of the motion.
The results are illustrated with two examples of motions: the symmetric
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy process in $\erre^d$ $(0<\alpha\leq2)$,and the so called
c-hierarchical random walk in the hierarchical group of order N (0<c<N). We
show that the two motions have analogous asymptotics of $G_t$ and its powers
that depend on an order parameter $\gamma$ for their transience /recurrence
behavior. This parameter is $\gamma=d/\alpha-1$ for the $\alpha$-stable motion,
and $\gamma=\log c/\log (N/c)$ for the c-hierarchical random walk. As a
consequence of these analogies, the asymptotics of the occupation time
fluctuations of the corresponding branching particle systems are also
analogous. In the case of the c-hierarchical random walk, however, the growth
of $G_t$ and its powers is modulated by oscillations on a logarithmic time
scale.

Kodaira dimension and the fundamental group of X, we succeed in classifying
algebraic surfaces which are dominable by $\CC^2$ except for certain cases in
which X is an algebraic surface of Kodaira dimension zero and the case when X
is rational without any logarithmic 1-form. More specifically, in the case when
X is compact (namely projective), we need to exclude only the case when X is

total cross sections and simple phenomenological assumptions. Our evaluation of
the energy-weighted integrals is in good agreement for the proton but shows big
discrepancies for the neutron.

C62 (2000) 054002","10.1103/PhysRevC.62.054002",,"nucl-th",,"  We investigate the difference between those relativistic models based on
interpreting a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction as a perturbation of the
square of a relativistic mass operator and those models that use the method of
Kamada and Gl\""ockle to construct an equivalent interaction to add to the
relativistic mass operator. Although both models reproduce the phase shifts and
binding energy of the corresponding non-relativistic model, they are not
scattering equivalent. The example of elastic electron-deuteron scattering in
the one-photon-exchange approximation is used to study the sensitivity of
three-body observables to these choices. Our conclusion is that the differences
in the predictions of the two models can be understood in terms of the
different ways in which the relativistic and non-relativistic $S$-matrices are
related. We argue that the mass squared method is consistent with conventional
procedures used to fit the Lorentz-invariant cross section as a function of the
laboratory energy.

upper levels to the 5s levels in neutral krypton atoms. The measurements were
made with a wall-stabilized electric arc and a 2m monochromator for the
spectral lines in the visible, and with a hollow cathode lamp and the NIST
2m-Fourier transform spectrometer for the lines in the near infrared. A
semi-empirical calculation, based on accurately known lifetimes for six upper
levels, was used to calculate lifetimes for which accurate measurements do not
exist. This resulted in a complete set of lifetimes for all 5p levels.
Branching fractions and lifetimes were used to calculate transition rates for
the 5p-5s transitions. The relative uncertainties of the transition rates range
from less than 1% for the strongest lines to about 10% for the weakest lines.
Our data also reveal that most of the previous measurements appear to have been
affected by opacity effects in the light sources.

physical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly
carry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed
to C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical
computer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the
specification of that external system's state as input and then correctly
predict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results
also mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation
apparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control
apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or
non-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an
infinitely fast, infinitely dense computer, with computational powers greater

the mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical
computation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing
Machines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the
(im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an
analogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is
elaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction
complexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal
physical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding''
bound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing
machine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it
is proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type
of computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic
information complexity).

ideal method of inference using Kolmogorov complexity. We test how the theory
behaves in practice on a general problem in model selection: that of learning
the best model granularity. The performance of a model depends critically on
the granularity, for example the choice of precision of the parameters. Too
high precision generally involves modeling of accidental noise and too low
precision may lead to confusion of models that should be distinguished. This
precision is often determined ad hoc. In MDL the best model is the one that
most compresses a two-part code of the data set: this embodies ``Occam's
Razor.'' In two quite different experimental settings the theoretical value
determined using MDL coincides with the best value found experimentally. In the
first experiment the task is to recognize isolated handwritten characters in
one subject's handwriting, irrespective of size and orientation. Based on a new
modification of elastic matching, using multiple prototypes per character, the
optimal prediction rate is predicted for the learned parameter (length of
sampling interval) considered most likely by MDL, which is shown to coincide
with the best value found experimentally. In the second experiment the task is
to model a robot arm with two degrees of freedom using a three layer
feed-forward neural network where we need to determine the number of nodes in
the hidden layer giving best modeling performance. The optimal model (the one
that extrapolizes best on unseen examples) is predicted for the number of nodes
in the hidden layer considered most likely by MDL, which again is found to
coincide with the best value found experimentally.
