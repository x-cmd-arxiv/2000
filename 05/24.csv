filaments emanating from them to large distances and with smaller objects
forming and draining in along these filaments. The amount of mass contained in
structure near the cluster can be comparable to the collapsed mass of the
cluster itself. As the lensing kernel is quite broad along the line of sight
around cluster lenses with typical redshifts near z=0.5, structures many Mpc
away from the cluster are essentially at the same location as the cluster

analysis. A correction for the scatter in possible observed lensing masses
should be included when interpreting mass functions from weak lensing surveys.

  This dissertation concerns the use of CCDs for for X-ray astronomy. Part I of
this thesis focuses on the calibration of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
(ACIS), one of the two primary focal plane instruments on the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. I begin by presenting a series of measurements made using
undispersed synchrotron radiation. I analyzed the results of these experiments
to extract parameters necessary to model the absolute detection efficiency of
CCDs used as reference standards for ACIS characterization. I also discuss a
novel ""mesh"" technique I pioneered to non-destructively measure the sub-pixel
structure of CCDs, including the channel stops and gates. Guided by the results
of the mesh experiments, I performed additional measurements to constrain
recombination effects in the channel stops.
  Part II of this thesis concerns the X-ray properties of rotation- powered
(radio) pulsars. High energy observations serve as a powerful diagnostic of the
energetics and emission mechanisms of neutron stars. I analyze ASCA and ROSAT
observations of three young pulsars which are particularly well-suited for
addressing these issues. I also present observations of the rotation-powered
pulsar with the highest known magnetic field, and describe how the results
relate to anomalous X-ray pulsars, another type of neutron star. Finally, I
analyze Chandra observations of the supernova remnant Cas A. These data fully
demonstrate the capabilities of ACIS and reveal a previously unknown point
source at the center of the remnant.

classical T Tauri star DG Tau using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A series of seven spatially
offset long-slit spectra spaced by 0.07'' were obtained along the axis of the
outflow to build up a 3-D intensity-velocity ``cube'' in various forbidden
emission lines (FELs) and Ha. Here we present high spatial resolution synthetic
line images close to the star in distinct radial velocity intervals (from ~ +50
km/s to ~ -450 km/s in four bins, each ~ 125 km/s wide). The lowest velocity
emission is also examined in finer detail (from +60 km/s to -70 km/s in five
bins ~ 25 km/s wide). We have found that the highest velocity and most highly
collimated component, i.e. the jet, can be traced from DG Tau to a distance D ~
0.7''. The jet is on the axis of a pear-shaped limb-brightened bubble which
extends between 0.4'' and 1.5'' from the source and which we interpret as a bow
shock. Other condensations are seen close to the star indicating ongoing
temporal variations in the flow. The low-velocity component of the outflow is
found to be spatially wide close to the source (~ 0.2'' at D=0.2''), in
contrast to the high velocity jet (width <~ 0.1''). We have also found evidence
to suggest that the density increases longitudinally with proximity to the
source and also laterally towards the flow axis. Thus, at least in the case of
DG Tau, the flow becomes gradually denser as it increases in velocity and
becomes more collimated. Our observations show a continous bracketing of the
higher speed central flow within the lower speed, less collimated, broader
flow, down to the lowest velocity scales. This suggests that the low and high
velocity FELs in the highly active T Tauri star DG Tau are intimately related.

account the recombination of ions and electrons at grain surfaces, which is an
important process in most parts of the disks. We find that for all the models
there is an inner region which is magnetorotationally stable due to ohmic
dissipation. This must make the accretion onto the central star non-steady. For
the model of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the critical radius, inside of
which the disk is stable, is about 20 AU, and the mass accretion rate just
outside the critical radius is 10^{-7} - 10^{-6} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}. The stable
region is smaller in a disk of lower column density. Dust grains in
protoplanetary disks may grow by mutual sticking and may sediment toward the
midplane of the disks. We find that the stable region shrinks as the grain size
increases or the sedimentation proceeds. Therefore in the late evolutionary
stages, protoplanetary disks can be magnetorotationally unstable even in the
inner regions.

spanning from 1.4 to 350 GHz for the period of 3 to 83 days after the burst.
This radio data, in addition to measurements at the optical bands, suggest that
the afterglow arises from a collimated outflow, i.e. a jet. To test this
hypothesis in a self-consistent manner, we employ a global fit and find that a
model of a jet, expanding into a constant density medium (ISM+jet), provides
the best fit to the data. A model of the burst occurring in a wind-shaped
circumburst medium (wind-only model) can be ruled out, and a wind+jet model
provides a much poorer fit of the optical/IR data than the ISM+jet model. In
addition, we present the first clear indication that the reported fluctuations
in the optical/IR are achromatic with similar amplitudes in all bands, and
possibly extend into the radio regime. Using the parameters derived from the
global fit, in particular a jet break time, t_{jet}=7.5 days, we infer a jet
opening angle of \theta=0.2, and consequently the estimate of the emitted
energy in the GRB itself is reduced by a factor of 50 relative to the isotropic

set of column densities N to stars of known distance can in principle be used
to recover a three-dimensional density field n, since the two quantities are

characterizing the stellar spatial distribution. In practice, however, there is
an infinte number of solutions to this equation. We use a maximum entropy
reconstruction algorithm to find the density field containing the least
information which is consistent with the observations. The solution obtained
with this technique is, in some sense, the model containing the minimum
structure. We apply the algorithm to several simulated data sets to demonstrate
its feasibility and success at recovering ``real'' density contrasts.
  This technique can be applied to any set of column densities whose end points
are specified. In a subsequent paper we shall describe the application of this

ellipticities of target sources that is usually made in searches for weak
gravitational lensing due to large-scale mass inhomogeneities (``field

either by the angular momentum or the shape of the halo in which it forms, then
the image should be aligned preferentially with the component of the tidal
gravitational field perpendicular to the line of sight. Long-range correlations
in the tidal field will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity
correlations that mimic the shear correlations due to weak gravitational
lensing. We calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation expected if halo
shapes determine the observed galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which
are still considerable) in the predicted amplitude of this correlation. The
ellipticity-ellipticity correlation induced by angular momenta should be
smaller. We consider several methods for discriminating between the
weak-lensing (extrinsic) and intrinsic correlations, including the use of
redshift information. An ellipticity--tidal-field correlation also implies the
existence of an alignment of images of galaxies near clusters. Although the
intrinsic alignment may complicate the interpretation of field-lensing results,
it is inherently interesting as it may shed light on galaxy formation as well
as on structure formation.

explain the extremely high energy (EHE) cosmic rays so far observed as
originating from a single source (M87 in the Virgo cluster), the magnetic field
strongly magnifies the fluxes and produces multiple images of the source. The
apparent position on Earth of the principal image moves, for decreasing
energies, towards the galactic south. It is typically amplified by an order of
magnitude at $E/Z\sim 2\times 10^{20}$ eV, but becomes strongly demagnified
below $10^{20}$ eV. At energies below $E/Z\sim 1.3\times 10^{20}$ eV, all
events in the northern galactic hemisphere are due to secondary images, which
have huge amplifications ($>10^2$). This model would imply strong asymmetries
between the north and south galactic hemispheres, such as a (latitude
dependent) upper cut-off value below $2\times 10^{20}$ eV for CR protons
arriving to the south and lower fluxes in the south than in the north above
$10^{20}$ eV. The large resulting magnifications reduce the power requirements
on the source, but the model needs a significant tunning between the direction
to the source and the symmetry axis of the wind. If more modest magnetic field
strengths were assumed, a scenario in which the observed EHE events are heavier
nuclei whose flux is strongly lensed becomes also plausible and would predict
that a transition from a light composition to a heavier one could take place at
the highest energies.

possible to achieve distance errors of only a few percent. With such distances
at hand, it becomes possible to determine an accurate zero-point for the
Tully-Fisher relation, one of the tools to measure distances throughout the
universe.
  The rotational parallax method employs the common orbital motions of a of
stars within a galaxy to determine their distance. For stars on circular
orbits, the two proper motions and the radial velocity suffice to determine the
inclination of the orbit, the rotational velocity and the distance. Several
factors complicate the application of this simple technique to real galaxies:
1) the target galaxy may have substantial space-motion, 2) stars in real
galaxies are not on circular orbits (e.g. due to spiral-arm streaming motions
or induced by random motions), 3) stars in the galaxy are at significantly
different distances from the Sun (the near side of M 31 is ~5% closer than the
far side).
  Notwithstanding these complication, distances can be determined to within
several percent for the nearest spirals. (abridged)

superlattices (SPS) with strain-induced lateral ordering is presented. The
theory is based on the effective bond-orbital model (EBOM) combined with a
valence-force field (VFF) model. Valence-band anisotropy, band mixing, and
effects due to local strain distribution at the atomistic level are all taken
into account. Several structure models with varying degrees of alloy mixing for
lateral modulation are considered. A valence force field model is used to find
the equilibrium atomic positions in the QWR structure by minimizing the lattice
energy. The strain tensor at each atomic (In or Ga) site is then obtained and
included in the calculation of electronic states and optical properties. It is
found that different local arrangement of atoms leads to very different strain
distribution, which in turn alters the optical properties. In particular, we
found that in model structures with thick capping layer the electron and hole
are confined in the Ga-rich region and the optical anisotropy can be reversed
due to the variation of lateral alloying mixing, while for model structures
with thin capping layer the electron and hole are confined in the In-rich
region, and the optical anisotropy is much less sensitive to the lateral alloy
mixing.

physically interesting spacetimes which are not conformally static. The
treatment is fully general but, as an example, we also discuss the special case
of the Oppenheimer-Snyder model. The analysis of the late time behaviour shows
a close correspondence between the structure of optical spacetime for
gravitational collapse and that of flat spacetime with an accelerating
boundary. Thus, optical geometry provides a natural physical interpretation for
derivations of the Hawking effect based on the ``moving mirror analogy.''

evaporation and the information paradox from the perspective of optical

However, for this effect to be observable the mass difference between the two

find that the temperature of the radiation dominated (RD) phase of the universe

assumptions: firstly that the initial state of the Universe corresponded to a
dense, hot gas in which all degrees of freedom were in thermal equilibrium, and
secondly that the topology of the background space admits one-cycles. We argue
by t-duality that in this context the cosmological singularities are not
present. We derive the equation of state of the brane gases and apply the
results to suggest that, in an expanding background, the winding modes of
fundamental strings will play the most important role at late times. In
particular, we argue that the string winding modes will only allow four
space-time dimensions to become large. The presence of brane winding modes with
$p > 1$ may lead to a hierarchy in the sizes of the extra dimensions.

conditions on the scalar potential such that domain wall solutions are
non-singular. Such solutions even exist for appropriate potentials which have
no minima at all and are unbounded below. Domain walls of this type have
infinite tension, while usual kink type of solutions interpolating between two
AdS minima have finite tension. Non-singular domain walls with infinite tension
might a priori avoid recent ``no-go'' theorems indicating impossibility of
supersymmetric embedding of kink type of domain walls in gauged supergravity.
We argue that (non-singular) domain walls are stable even if they have infinite
tension. This is essentially due to the fact that localization of gravity in
smooth domain walls is a Higgs mechanism corresponding to a spontaneous
breakdown of translational invariance. We point out that if the scalar
potential has no minima and approaches finite negative values at infinity, then
higher derivative terms are under control, and do not affect the cosmological
constant on the brane which is vanishing for such backgrounds. Nonetheless, we
also point out that higher curvature terms generically delocalize gravity, so
that the desired lower dimensional Newton's law is no longer reproduced.

or D-branes forces the space-time coordinates to be noncommutative. This effect
is equivalent to replacing ordinary products in the effective theory by the
deformed star product. An immediate consequence of this is that all fields get
complexified. The only possible noncommutative Yang-Mills theory is the one
with U(N) gauge symmetry. By applying this idea to gravity one discovers that
the metric becomes complex. We show in this article that this procedure is
completely consistent and one can obtain complexified gravity by gauging the
symmetry $U(1,D-1)$ instead of the usual $SO(1,D-1)$. The final theory depends
on a Hermitian tensor containing both the symmetric metric and antisymmetric
tensor. In contrast to other theories of nonsymmetric gravity the action is
both unique and gauge invariant. The results are then generalized to
noncommutative spaces.

cancellation occurs in a highly non trivial way, due to a complicated interplay

this same result is valid for any simple gauge group. Contact term
contributions signal the presence of ultraviolet divergences. They are
arbitrary at the tree level, but the absence of perturbative renormalization in

packings is defined. Up to Moebius transformations, this class is a three
parameter family, that contains the famous Doyle spirals as a special case. The
solutions are given explicitly. It is shown, that these circle packings can be
viewed as discretizations of the quotient of two Airy functions.

equation when the spatial range of the forcing varies. As the range of forcing
moves from small scales to large scales, the system goes from a chaotic,
structureless state to a structured state dominated by shocks. This transition
takes place through an intermediate region where the system exhibits rich
multifractal behavior. This is mainly the region of interest to us. We only
mention in passing the hydrodynamic limit of forcing confined to large scales,
where much work has taken place since that of Polyakov.
  In order to make the general framework clear, we give an introduction to
aspects of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence, a description of Kolmogorov
scaling, and, with the help of a simple model, an introduction to the language
of multifractality which is used to discuss intermittency corrections to
scaling.
  We continue with a general discussion of the Burgers equation and forcing,
and some aspects of three dimensional turbulence where - because of the
mathematical analogy between equations derived from the Navier-Stokes and
Burgers equations - one can gain insight from the study of the simpler
stochastic Burgers equation. These aspects concern the connection of
dissipation rate intermittency exponents with those characterizing the
structure functions of the velocity field, and the dynamical behavior,
characterized by different time constants, of velocity structure functions. We
also show how the exponents characterizing the multifractal behavior of
velocity structure functions in the above mentioned transition region can
effectively be calculated in the case of the stochastic Burgers equation.
