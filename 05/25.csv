galaxy formation to study the spatial and kinematic distributions of cluster
galaxies in a LCDM cosmology. We investigate how the star formation rates,
colours and morphologies of galaxies vary as a function of distance from the
cluster centre and compare our results with the CNOC1 survey of galaxies from
15 X-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.18 to 0.55. In our model,
gas no longer cools onto galaxies after they fall into the cluster and their
star formation rates decline on timescales of 1-2 Gyr. Galaxies in cluster
cores have lower star formation rates and redder colours than galaxies in the
outer regions because they were accreted earlier. Our colour and star formation
gradients agree with those those derived from the data. The difference in
velocity dispersions between red and blue galaxies observed in the CNOC1
clusters is also well reproduced by the model. We assume that the morphologies
of cluster galaxies are determined solely by their merging histories.
Morphology gradients in clusters arise naturally, with the fraction of bulge-
dominated galaxies highest in cluster cores. We compare these gradients with
the CNOC1 data and find excellent agreement for bulge-dominated galaxies. The
simulated clusters contain too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-disk
ratio, suggesting that additional processes may influence the morphological
evolution of disk-dominated galaxies in clusters. Although the properties of
the cluster galaxies in our model agree extremely well with the data, the same
is not true of field galaxies. Both the star formation rates and the colours of
bright field galaxies appear to evolve much more strongly from redshift 0.2 to
0.4 in the CNOC1 field sample than in our simulations.

hole. Consider a Kerr black hole with a dense plasma torus spinning around it.
A toroidal electric current flows on the surface of the torus, which generates
a poloidal magnetic field outside the torus. On the surface of the tours the
magnetic field is parallel to the surface. The closed magnetic field lines
winding around the torus compress and confine the plasma in the torus, as in
the case of tokamaks. Though it is unclear if such a model is stable, we look
into the consequences if the model is stable. If the magnetic field is strong
enough, the baryonic contamination from the plasma in the torus is greatly
suppressed by the magnetic confinement and a clean magnetosphere of
electron-positron pairs is built up around the black hole. Since there are no
open magnetic field lines threading the torus and no accretion, the power of
the torus is zero. If some magnetic field lines threading the black hole are
open and connect with loads, clean energy can be extracted from the Kerr black
hole by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.
  The model may be relevant to gamma-ray bursts. The energy in the Poynting
flux produced by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is converted into the kinetic
energy of the electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere around the black
hole, which generates two oppositely directed jets of electron-positron pairs
with super-high bulk Lorentz factors. The jets collide and interact with the
interstellar medium, which may produce gamma-ray bursts and the afterglows.

limiting magnitude of approximately 22 in both bands, and cover a total area of
approximately 92 square arcminutes. The reddest of the 358 galaxies detected
have F110W-F160W colors and F160W magnitudes consistent with being a
combination of both dusty star-forming and evolved early-type galaxies at 1 < z
< 2. The surface density of these galaxies is comparable to that of the
population of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) discovered in ground-based surveys

types in this redshift range. Roughly 10% of the detected galaxies appear to be
blue compact dwarf galaxies at z < 1, a result consistent with studies of the
HST Medium Deep Survey Fields. The surface density of these objects down to
magnitude of 22 in F160W is ~ 300 deg-2. None of the 681 point sources detected
have F110W-F160W colors matching those expected for QSOs whose continua have
been significantly reddened by internal dust. Our data limit the surface
density of such QSOs to be < 50 deg-2 down the mean limiting magnitudes of the
sample images. Since the surface density of QSOs detected on the basis of
ultraviolet excess in optical surveys to comparable depth is ~ 100 deg-2, this
argues against the suggestion that dust-reddened QSOs comprise the undetected
majority of the QSO population. The F110W-F160W color can also be used to
identify unreddened QSOs at z > 8, but we find no such candidates. This is
consistent with the evidence that QSO space density declines sharply at z > 5.

support to the notion that evidence for the last stable orbit in the accretion
disk of 4U 1820-30 has been observed. For a model consisting of Comptonization
of cool photons by hot electrons plus an additional blackbody component, we
report an abrupt change in the spectral parameters at the same accretion rate
at which the kHz QPOs disappear. For a model consisting of a multicolor disk
blackbody plus a cut-off power law, we find that the inner disk radius reaches
a minimum at the same accretion rate at which the kHz QPO frequency saturates,
as expected if the disk reaches the last stable orbit. Both models face
theoretical and observational problems when interpreted physically for this

hard component from an extended Comptonizing corona. Comparing our results with
those of a similar study of the brighter source 4U 1820-30 (Bloser et al.

Prospects are promising that detailed theory and data from RXTE and future

representatives of different kinds of explosive burning. RXTE's discovery of a

bursters indisputably to the epitome of a neutron star, a fast spinning

difference of lobe spacings in submillimeter (~15"") and millimeter (~26"") lines
indicates the presence of a `low' and a `high' CO excitation component. An LVG
excitation analysis of the submillimeter lines leads to inconsistencies, since
area and volume filling factors are almost the same, resulting in cloud sizes
along the lines-of-sight that match the entire size of the M82 starburst
region. Nevertheless, LVG column densities agree with estimates derived from
the dust emission in the far infrared and at submillimeter wavelengths.
Accounting for high UV fluxes and variations in kinetic temperature and
assuming that the observed emission arises from photon dominated regions (PDRs)
resolves the problems related to an LVG treatment of the radiative transfer.
12CO/13CO line intensity ratios > 10 indicate that the bulk of the CO emission
arises in UV-illuminated diffuse cloud fragments of small column density and
sub-parsec cloud sizes with area filling factors >> 1. Thus CO arises from
quite a different gas component than the classical high density tracers. The
dominance of such a diffuse molecular interclump medium also explains observed
high [CI}/CO line intensity ratios. PDR models do not allow a determination of
the relative abundances of 12CO to 13CO. Ignoring magnetic fields, the CO gas
appears to be close to the density limit for tidal disruption. A warm diffuse
ISM not only dominates the CO emission in the starburst region of M82 but is
also ubiquitous in the central region of our Galaxy, where tidal stress,
cloud-cloud collisions, shocks, high gas pressure, and high stellar densities
may all contribute to the formation of a highly fragmented molecular debris.

simulate halos in large volumes with a such accuracy that halos survive in
dense environments of groups and clusters of galaxies. Halos in simulations
look like real galaxies, and, thus, can be used to study the biases --
differences between galaxies and the dark matter. The biases depend on scale,
redshift, and circular velocities of selected halos. Two processes seem to
define the evolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias and (2) merger
bias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces the
number of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).
There are two kinds of velocity bias. The pair-wise velocity bias is
b_12=0.6-0.8 at r< 5Mpc/h, z=0. This bias mostly reflects the spatial bias and
provides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies and
the dark matter. One-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities.
Inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v =1.1-1.3) than
the dark matter. Qualitatively this result can be understood using the Jeans
equations of the stellar dynamics. For the standard LCDM model we find that the
correlation function and the power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are
antibiased on scales r<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc.

radii r=(0.005-1)rvir the density profile for a quiet isolated halo is very
accurately approximated by a fit suggested by Moore etal (1997):
rho=1/x^1.5(1+x^1.5), where x=r/rs and rs is a characteristic radius. The fit
suggested by Navarro et al (1995) rho= 1/x(1+x)^2, also gives a very
satisfactory approximation with relative errors of about 10% for radii not
smaller than 1% of the virial radius. The mass function of z=0 halos with mass
below 10^{13}Msun/h is approximated by a power law with slope alpha =-1.85. The
slope increases with the redshift. The velocity function of halos with Vmax<
500km/s is also a power law with the slope beta= -3.8-4. The power-law extends
to halos at least down to 10km/s. It is also valid for halos inside larger
virialized halos. The concentration of halos depends on mass (more massive
halos are less concentrated) and environment, with isolated halos being less
concentrated than halos of the same mass inside clusters. Halos have intrinsic
scatter of concentration: at 1sigma level halos with the same mass have
Delta(log{c_vir})=0.18 or, equivalently, DeltaVmax/Vmax =0.12. Velocity

These fits are used to objectively evaluate light curve parameters. We find
that the relative times of maximum light in the filter passbands are very
similar for most objects. Surprisingly the maximum at longer wavelengths is
reached earlier than in the B and V light curves. This clearly demonstrates the
complicated nature of the supernova emission. Bolometric light curves for a
small sample of well-observed SNe Ia are constructed by integration over the
optical filters. In most objects a plateau or inflection is observed in the
light curve about 20-40 days after bolometric maximum. The strength of this
plateau varies considerably among the individual objects in the sample.
Furthermore the rise times show a range of several days for the few objects
which have observations early enough for such an analysis. On the other hand,
the decline rate between 50 and 80 days past maximum is remarkably similar for
all objects, with the notable exception of SN 1991bg. The similar late decline
rates for the supernovae indicate that the energy release at late times is very
uniform; the differences at early times is likely due to the radiation
diffusing out of the ejecta. With the exception of SN 1991bg, the range of
absolute bolometric luminosities of SNe Ia is found to be at least a factor of
2.5. The nickel masses derived from this estimate range from 0.4 to 1.1 Msun.
It seems impossible to explain such a mass range by a single explosion
mechanism, especially since the rate of gamma-ray escape at late phases seems
to be very uniform.

overestimate significantly the observed fluxes. This implies that simply
assuming a low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas is not enough to
explain their low luminosities. Smaller central densities and accretion rates,
as expected in the presence of strong mass loss or convection in the flows, can
help reconcile the models with observations. We also show that a significant
contribution to the high-frequency radio spectra can be due to non-thermal
synchrotron emission from the small scale radio jets observed in these systems,
allowing for even lower accretion rates in the inflows. We suggest that these
outflows or jets may dump significant energy into the surronding medium close
to the accretion radius and so reduce the accretion rates onto these systems.

typical field white dwarfs appears to be robust.

different subsequent processes: A short-time non-exponential decay and a
long-time exponential reorientation arising from the relaxation of medium-size
chain segments. Both processes depend on stiffness and chain length. The strong
influence of the chain length on the chain dynamics is in marked contrast to
its negligible effect on the static structure of the melt. The local structure
shows only a small dependence on the stiffness, and is independent of chain
length. Calculated correlation functions related to double-quantum NMR

plateau is observed in the dependence of segment reorientation on the

interference pattern depends on the phenomenological parameters that define
this kind of terms. Afterwards, using the so called restricted path integral
formalism, the case of a particle whose position is being continuously
monitored, is analyzed, and the effects that this Yukawa potential could have
on the measurement outputs are obtained. This allows us to obtain another
scheme that could lead to the detection of these terms. This last part also
renders new theoretical predictions that could enable us to confront the

show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the

for a minimally coupled massless scalar field, while is proportional to
$(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-1}$ for a conformally coupled massless scalar field, where
$t_{\rm CH}-t$ is the `remained time' until the distant observer could observe
the singularity if the naked singularity was formed. As a consequence, the
radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields. The amount of the
power and the energy depends on parameters which characterize the initial
density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud. In
particular, there is characteristic frequency $\nu_{s}$ of singularity above
which the divergent energy is radiated. The energy flux is dominated by
particles of which the wave length is about $t_{\rm CH}-t$ at each moment. The
observed total spectrum is nonthermal, i.e., $\nu dN/d\nu \sim
(\nu/\nu_{s})^{-1}$ for $\nu>\nu_{s}$. If the naked singularity formation could
continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is
radiated, the radiated energy would reach about $10^{54}(M/M_{\odot})$ erg. The
calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out
to be consistent as a rough order estimate. The analysis does not depend on
whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning. This
phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultra high energy cosmic

N=3 superfields. We find a ring structure underlying these short
representations, which is just the direct generalization of the chiral ring
structure of N=2 theories. When the superconformal field theory is realized on
the world-volume of an M2-brane such superfield ring is the counterpart of the
ring defined by the algebraic geometry of the 8-dimensional cone transverse to
the brane. This and other arguments identify the N=3 superconformal field
theory dual to M-theory compactified on AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0}. It is an N=3 gauge
theory with SU(N) x SU(N) gauge group coupled to a suitable set of
hypermultiplets, with an additional Chern Simons interaction. The AdS/CFT
correspondence can be directly verified using the recently worked out Kaluza
Klein spectrum of N^{0,1,0} and we find a perfect match. We also note that
besides the usual set of BPS conformal operators dual to the lightest KK
states, we find that the composite operators corresponding to certain massive
KK modes are organized into a massive spin 3/2 N=3 multiplet that might be
identified with the super-Higgs multiplet of a spontaneously broken N=4 theory.

multiplet in N=3 compactifications. It turns out to be a massive spin 3/2
multiplet with scale dimension E_0=3 and with the quantum numbers of a
super-Higgs multiplet. Hence each N=3 AdS_4 x X^7 vacuum is actually to be
interpreted as a spontaneously broken phase of an N=4 theory. Comparison with
standard gauged N=4 supergravity in 4 dimensions reveals the unexpected bound
E_0<3 on the dimension of the broken gravitino multiplet. This hints to the
existence of new versions of extended supergravities, in particular N=4 where
such upper bounds are evaded and where all possible vacua have a reduced
supersymmetry N_0<N. We name them shadow supergravities. In particular, using
arguments based on the solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the scalar
manifold, we discuss the possible structure of shadow N=4 supergravity. Using
our previous results on the SCFT dual of the AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} vacuum we
discuss the SCFT realization of the universal N=3 shadow multiplet. RG flows
from an N=4 to an N=3 phase are ruled out by the fact that the N=4 vacuum is at
infinite distance in moduli space, denoting the presence of a topology change.

theories can never be quantized immediately because the basic fields of the
theory become operator valued distributions. Therefore, one is usually forced
to find a classical substitute for such a function depending on a regulator
which is expressed in terms of smeared quantities and which can be quantized in
a well-defined way. Namely, the smeared functions define a new symplectic
manifold of their own which is easy to quantize. Finally one must remove the
regulator and establish that the final operator, if it exists, has the correct
classical limit.
  In this paper we investigate these steps for diffeomorphism invariant quantum
field theories of connections. We introduce a generalized projective family of
symplectic manifolds, coordinatized by the smeared fields, which is labelled by
a pair consisting of a graph and another graph dual to it. We show that there
exists a generalized projective sequence of symplectic manifolds whose limit
agrees with the symplectic manifold that one started from.
  This family of symplectic manifolds is easy to quantize and we illustrate the
programme outlined above by applying it to the Gauss constraint. The framework
developed here is the classical cornerstone on which the semi-classical
analysis developed in a new series of papers called ``Gauge Theory Coherent
States'' is based.

  In this paper we establish the ``Ehrenfest Property'' of these states which
are labelled by a point (A,E), a connection and an electric field, in the
classical phase space. By this we mean that i) The expectation value of {\it
all} elementary quantum operators $\hat{O}$ with respect to the coherent state
with label (A,E) is given to zeroth order in $\hbar$ by the value of the
corresponding classical function O evaluated at the phase space point (A,E) and
ii) The expectation value of the commutator between two elementary quantum
operators $[\hat{O}_1,\hat{O}_2]/(i\hbar)$ divided by $i\hbar$ with respect to
the coherent state with label (A,E) is given to zeroth order in $\hbar$ by the
value of the Poisson bracket between the corresponding classical functions
$\{O_1,O_2\}$ evaluated at the phase space point (A,E).
  These results can be extended to all polynomials of elementary operators and
to a certain non-polynomial function of the elementary operators associated
with the volume operator of quantum general relativity. It follows that the
infinitesimal quantum dynamics of quantum general relativity is to zeroth order
in $\hbar$ indeed given by classical general relativity.

  This Hilbert space, together with its generalization due to Baez and Sawin,
is appropriate for semi-classical quantum general relativity if the spacetime
is spatially compact. In the spatially non-compact case, however, an extension
of the Hilbert space is needed in order to approximate metrics that are
macroscopically nowhere degenerate.
  For this purpose, in this paper we apply von Neumann's theory of the Infinite
Tensor Product (ITP) of Hilbert Spaces to Quantum General Relativity. The
cardinality of the number of tensor product factors can take the value of any
possible Cantor aleph as is needed for our problem, where a Hilbert space is
attached to each edge of an arbitrarily complicated, generally infinite graph.
  The new framework opens a pandora's box full of techniques, appropriate to
pose fascinating physical questions such as quantum topology change,
semi-classical quantum gravity, effective low energy physics etc. from the
universal point of view of the ITP. In particular, the study of photons and
gravitons propagating on fluctuating quantum spacetimes is now in reach, the

themselves untouched. (b) While these states depend in some sense on
complexified connections, it remained unclear what the complexification was in
terms of the coordinates of the underlying real phase space. In this paper we
resolve these issues, in particular, we prove that this family of states
satisfies all the usual properties : i) Peakedness in the configuration,
momentum and phase space (or Bargmann-Segal) representation, ii) Saturation of
the unquenched Heisenberg uncertainty bound. iii) (Over)completeness. These
states therefore comprise a candidate family for the semi-classical analysis of

a formalism to solve the coupled dynamics of the cosmological perturbations in

formalism, the late time evolution of the cosmological scalar perturbations at
any scales larger than the AdS curvature scale $l$ is shown to be identical
with the one obtained in the conventional 4D cosmology, provided the effect of
heavy graviton modes may be neglected. Here the late time means the epoch when
the Hubble horizon $H^{-1}$ in the 4D brane world is sufficiently larger than
the AdS curvature scale $l$. If the inflation occurs sufficiently lower than
$l^{-1}$, the scalar temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave
Background at large scales can be calculated using the constancy of the Bardeen
parameter as is done in the 4D cosmology. The assumption of the result is that
the effect of the massive graviton with mass $m e^{-\alpha_0}>l^{-1}$ in the

proved that in this case S is of general type and $\epsilon$ is the canonical
map of S. Beauville has also constructed the only infinite series of examples
$\phi:X\to \Sigma$ with the above properties that was known up to now. Starting
from his construction, we define a {\em good generating pair}, namely a pair
$(h:V\to W, L)$ where h is a finite morphism of surfaces and L is a nef and big
line bundle of W satisfying certain assumptions. We show that by applying a
construction analogous to Beauville's to a good generating pair one obtains an
infinite series of surfaces of general type whose canonical map is 2-to-1 onto
a canonically embedded surface. In this way we are able to construct more
infinite series of such surfaces. In addition, we show that good generating
pairs have bounded invariants and that there exist essentially only 2 examples
with $\dim |L|>1$. The key fact that we exploit for obtaining these results is
that the Albanese variety P of V is a Prym variety and that the fibre of the

chemical potential and temperature. We describe order parameters whose

their use in demarcating the quark gluon plasma phase boundary and
characterising the plasma's properties. Hadron traits change in an equilibrated
plasma. We exemplify this and discuss putative signals of the effects. Finally,

agreement is obtained in the chaotic domain of the spectrum, and strong

in the chaotic domain of isolated finite interacting many particle systems
smoothed densities (they include strength functions) define the statistical

eddies which follow quantumlike mechanical laws. The model concepts enable to
show that the continuum real number field contains unique structures, namely
prime numbers which are analogous to the dominant eddies in the eddy continuum
in turbulent fluid flows. In this paper it is shown that the prime number

the most important unresolved issues in the foundational aspects of quantum
mechanics. We show that the problem is resolved if the quantum correlations are
calculated directly from local quantities which preserve the phase information
in the quantum system. We assume strict locality for the probability amplitudes
instead of local realism for the outcomes, and calculate an amplitude
correlation function.Then the experimentally observed correlation of outcomes
is calculated from the square of the amplitude correlation function. Locality
of amplitudes implies that the measurement on one particle does not collapse
the companion particle to a definite state. Apart from resolving the EPR
puzzle, this approach shows that the physical interpretation of apparently
`nonlocal' effects like quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping are
different from what is usually assumed. Bell type measurements do not change
distant states. Yet the correlations are correctly reproduced, when measured,
if complex probability amplitudes are treated as the basic local quantities. As
examples we discuss the quantum correlations of two-particle maximally
entangled states and the three-particle GHZ entangled state.

that these states cannot be used to transmit more classical bits than the
number of qubits used, yet there are ways of conveying information with
exponentially fewer qubits than possible classically. Moreover, these methods
have a very simple structure---they involve little interaction between the
communicating parties. We look more closely at the ways in which information
encoded in quantum states may be manipulated, and consider the question as to
whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum
protocol of similar efficiency. By a simpler protocol, we mean a protocol that
uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a
problem such that its k+1 message classical communication complexity is
exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity, thus
answering the above question in the negative. Our result builds on two
primitives, local transitions in bi-partite states (based on previous work) and
average encoding which may be of significance in other applications as well.
