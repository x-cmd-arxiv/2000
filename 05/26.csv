an accretion disk corona system to static homogeneous flares. We model a flare
by a rapid (comparable to the light crossing time) energy dissipation in the
corona or the disk.
  If the flares originate from the disk, the coronal response to the soft
photon shots produces a strongly non-linear Comptonised radiation output, with
complex correlation/anti-correlations between energy bands. This behavior
strongly differs from those found with usual linear calculations.
  Thus any model for the rapid aperiodic variability of X-ray binaries invoking
a varying soft photon input as a source for the hard X-ray variability has to
take into account the coronal temperature response.
  On the other hand, if the flare is due to a violent heating of the corona,
when the perturbation time scale is of the order of a few corona light crossing
times, the shot spectrum evolves from hard to soft.
  This general trend is independent of the shot profile and geometry.
  We show that for short dissipation time, the time averaged spectra are
generally harder than in steady state situation. In addition, annihilation line
and high energy tails can be produced without need for non-thermal processes.

there is a higher fraction (29%) of compact steep spectrum sources (i.e.
sources with a projected linear size less than 20 kpc). Radio cores are
identified in about half of the sample and tend to have relatively steep
spectra (alpha < -1). Polarization is detected in all but 4 sources, with
typical polarization at 8.2 GHz of around 10-20%. The Faraday rotation can be
measured in most of the radio galaxies: the observed rotation measure (RM) of 8
radio sources exceeds 100 rad m^{-2} in at least one of the lobes, with large
gradients between the two lobes. We find no dependence of Faraday rotation with
other properties of the radio sources. If the origin of the Faraday rotation is
local to the sources, as we believe, then the intrinsic RM is more than a 1000
rad m^{-2}. Because low redshift radio galaxies residing at the center of
clusters usually show extreme RMs, we suggest that the high-z large RM sources
also lie in very dense environments. Finally, we find that the fraction of
powerful radio galaxies with extreme Faraday rotation increases with redshift,
as would be expected if their average environment tends to become denser with
decreasing cosmic epoch.

followed by a continuously accreting star. First, three models with a constant
accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm{accr}}$ = $10^{-6}$, $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Then several birthlines following the accretion models
of Bernasconi and Maeder (\cite{BM96}), which have $\dot{M}_{\rm{accr}}$
increasing only slightly with mass. Finally we calculate several birthlines for
which $\dot{M}_{accr} = \dot{M}_{\mathrm{ref}} ({\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}})
^{\phi}$, with values of $\phi$ equal to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 and also for

of PMS stars in the HR diagram is achieved for $\phi$ between 1.0 or 1.5 and

Considerations on the lifetimes favour values of $\phi$ equal to 1.5. These
accretion rates do well correspond to those derived from radio and IR
observations of mass outflows. We emphasize the importance of the accretion
scenario for shaping the IMF, and in particular for determining the upper mass
limit of stars. In the accretion scenario, this upper mass limit will be given
by the mass for which the accretion rate is such that the accretion induced
shock luminosity is of the order of the Eddington luminosity.

order phase transition in the vacuum state of a scalar field can lead to the

energy density could be a result of evolution of an effectively massless scalar
field at the inflational epoch. We demonstrate that in this case the situation
is valued when there are compact domains of less favorable vacuum surrounded by
a sea of another vacuum. Each domain has a surface composed of vacuum wall that

This offers the way of massive primordial black holes formation in the early

at equilibrium, i.e Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature. We explain the
relation between finite temperature quantum field theory in (d,1) dimensions
and statistical classical field theory in d+1 dimensions. This identification
allows to analyze the finite temperature QFT in terms of the renormalization
group and the theory of finite size effects of the classical theory. We discuss
in particular the limit of high temperature (HT) or the situation of finite
temperature phase transitions. There the concept of dimensional reduction plays
an essential role. Dimensional reduction in some sense reflects the known
property that quantum effects are not important at high temperature. We
illustrate these ideas with several standard examples, phi^4 field theory, the
non-linear sigma model and the Gross-Neveu model, gauge theories. We construct
the corresponding effective reduced theories at one-loop order, using the
technique of mode expansion of fields in the imaginary time variable. In models
where the field is a vector with N components, the large N expansion provides
another specially convenient tool to study dimensional reduction.

low-energy limit of the QCD partition function for $n$ fermionic flavors (or
replicas) in the sector of topological charge $\nu$. In the domain of the
smallest eigenvalues, this partition function is simply given by a U(n) unitary
matrix integral. We show that the asymptotic behavior of $\rho_s(x)$ for $x \to
\infty$ is obtained from the $n\to 0$ limit of this integral. The smooth
contributions to this series are obtained from an expansion about the replica
symmetric saddle-point, whereas the oscillatory terms follow from an expansion
about a saddle-point that breaks the replica symmetry. For $\nu =0$ we recover
the small-$x$ logarithmic singularity of the resolvent by means of the replica
trick. For half integer $\nu$, when the saddle point expansion of the U(n)
integral terminates, the replica trick reproduces the exact analytical result.
In all other cases only an asymptotic series that does not uniquely determine
the microscopic spectral density is obtained. We argue that bosonic replicas
fail to reproduce the microscopic spectral density. In all cases, the exact
answer is obtained naturally by means of the supersymmetric method.

contrast to the usual standpoints such as Connes' programme where a geometrical
structure is rigidly fixed. For instance, we can relate supersymmetries of
types N=2n and N=(n, n) in spite of their gap due to distinction between
$\Bbb{Z}_2$(even-odd)- and integer-gradings.
  Our approach goes beyond the theory of real homotopy due to Quillen, Sullivan
and Tanr\'e developed, respectively, in the 60's, 70's and 80's, which exhibits
real homotopy of a 1-connected space out of its de Rham-Fock complex with
supersymmetry. Our main new step is based upon the Taylor (super-)expansion and
locality, which links differential geometry with homotopy without the
restriction of 1-connectedness. While the homotopy invariants treated so far in
relation with supersymmetry are those depending only on $\Bbb{Z}_2$-grading
like the index, here we can detect new $\Bbb{N}$-graded homotopy invariants.
While our setup adopted here is (graded) commutative, it can be extended also
to the non-commutative cases in use of state germs (Haag-Ojima) corresponding
to a Taylor expansion.

tool in the study of quantum groups in action. We will use it in this paper to
study subfactors and inclusions of von Neumann algebras. When alpha is an
action of a locally compact quantum group on the von Neumann algebra N we can
give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the inclusion of the fixed
point algebra in the algebra N in the crossed product, is a basic construction.
When alpha is an outer and integrable action on a factor N we prove that the
inclusion of the fixed point algebra in the algebra N is irreducible, of depth
2 and regular, giving a converse to the results of Enock and Nest. Finally we
prove the equivalence of minimal and outer actions and we generalize a theorem

the impulse approximation. By far the largest uncertainty emerges from the
ambiguity in extending the many on-shell-equivalent representations of the
elementary amplitude off the mass shell. In the case of the quasifree process,
we study it for the photoproduction of the kaon meson. We compute the recoil
polarization of the lambda-hyperon and the photon asymmetry as well as the
differential cross section. By introducing the notion of a ``bound-nucleon
