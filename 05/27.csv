Quintessence scenarios (TEQ), where the dynamical vacuum energy driving the
acceleration of the universe today is coupled with the Ricci scalar, $R$, with
a term of the form $F(\phi)R/2$, where $F(\phi) = 1/8\pi
G+\xi(\phi^{2}-\phi_{0}^{2})$. Tracker solutions for these NMC models, with
inverse power-law potentials, possess an initial enhancement of the scalar
field dynamics, named $R$-boost, caused by the Ricci scalar in the Klein-Gordon
equation. During this phase the field performs a ""gravitational"" slow rolling
which we model analytically, with energy density scaling as $(1+z)^{2}$. We
evolve linear perturbations in TEQ models assuming Gaussian scale-invariant
initial spectrum. We obtain significant changes in the Integrated Sachs Wolfe
effect and in the acoustic peaks locations on the Cosmic Microwave Background,
as well as in the turnover on the matter power spectrum. All these corrections
may assume positive as well as negative values, depending on the sign of the
NMC parameter $\xi$. We give analytical formulas describing all these effects.
We show that they can be as large as $10 - 30%$ with respect to equivalent
cosmological constant and ordinary tracking Quintessence models, respecting all
the existing experimental constraints on scalar-tensor theories of gravity.
These results demonstrate that the next decade data will provide deep
constraints on the nature of the dark energy in the Universe, as well as the
structure of the theory of gravity.

lines can double or triple the flux through the UV bandpass at high redshifts.
Thus the (UV-B) color of a WR galaxy can be up to 1.3 mag bluer at high

of the field, the authors put forth the hypothesis that the black holes may
serve as a physical substratum for intelligent beings. This hypothesis is based
on four parallels between the brain-psyche system, on the one hand, and black
holes, on the other. (1) The descriptions of brain and psyche, in the system
brain-psyche, are complementary to each other, as descriptions by internal and
external observers of a black hole in Susskind-t'Hooft's schema. (2) There is
an aspect of the inner structure of a black hole in Kerr's model of the
rotating black hole that is isomorphic to the structure of the human subjective
domain in the psychological model of reflexion. (3) Both black holes and the
brain-psyche system have a facet which can be represented using thermodynamic
concepts. (4) The brain lends itself to a holographic description; as has been
recently demonstrated by Susskind, black holes can also be described
holographically. The authors speculate that the intelligent black holes can
generate other black holes by triggering creation of massive stars from which
new black holes arise after the stars' collapse. In addition, the authors
analyze certain strange phenomena related to the birth of young massive stars
which may or may not be connected with such a triggering.

a time invariant, monotonic function Y = u(X) relating the two quantities, Y

distributions of X and Y. We show that u(X) is the change of variables that
converts the distribution of X into the distribution of Y, while conserving
probability. We describe an algorithm for implementing this method and apply it
to several example distributions. We also demonstrate how the method can
separate spatial and temporal variations from a time series of energetic
electron flux measurements made by a spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit. We
expect this method will be useful to the general problem of spacecraft
instrument calibration. We also suggest some applications of the SAR method
outside of space physics.

``phase'' of the SU(2) Higgs model. Around separation r_b, the confining string
of the gauge field breaks by formation of a dynamical pair of light quarks. The
ground state and first excited state static potentials are determined by a
variational technique from a matrix correlation in which suitably smeared gauge
and Higgs fields enter. Our results at beta=2.4 clearly show string breaking
(r_b ~ 1.9r_0). The investigation of properly defined overlaps confirms the
interpretation of string breaking as a level crossing phenomenon between
string-type and meson-type states. We study the scaling properties of the
static potentials along a line of constant physics, varying the lattice spacing

investigated in many different physical settings. The full set of requirements
that must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is
daunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In
this report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that
can be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2],
and using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these
approaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable
Heisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\vec S}_i\cdot{\vec
S}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control
of a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit
operations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials
and device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence
rate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction
alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of
a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional
two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the
complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these
solid-state implementations of quantum computation.

strong resonance electromagnetic fields on absorption, amplification and
refractive indices as well as on four-wave mixing processes is investigated.
Doppler broadening of the coupled transitions, incoherent excitation,
relaxation processes, as well as power saturation processes associated with the
coupled levels are taken into account. Both closed (ground state is involved)
and open (only excited states are involved) energy level configurations are
considered. Common expressions are obtained which allow one to analyze the
optical characteristics (including gain without inversion and enhanced
refractive index at vanishing absorption) for various V, Lambda and H
configurations of interfering transitions by a simple substitution of
parameters. Similar expressions for resonant four-wave mixing in Raman
configurations are derived too. Crucial role of Doppler broadening is shown.
The theory is applied to numerical analysis of some recent and potential
experiments.
