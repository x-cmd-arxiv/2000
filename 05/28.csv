of a realistic jet numerically till its bulk velocity being as small as $\beta
c \sim 10^{-3} c$. We find no obvious break in the optical light curve during
the relativistic phase itself. However, an obvious break does exist at the
transition from the relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase, which
typically occurs at time $t \sim 10^6$ --- $10^{6.5}$ s (i.e., 10 --- 30 d).
The break is affected by many parameters, such as the electron energy fraction
$\xi_{\rm e}$, the magnetic energy fraction $\xi_{\rm B}^2$, the initial half
opening angle $\theta_0$, and the medium number density $n$. Increase of any of
them to a large enough value will make the break disappear. Although the break
itself is parameter-dependent, afterglows from jetted GRB remnants are
uniformly characterized by a quick decay during the non-relativistic phase,
with power law timing index $\alpha \geq 2.1$. This is quite different from
that of isotropic fireballs, and may be of fundamental importance for
determining the degree of beaming in $\gamma$-ray bursts observationally.

expts. by Valla et al., Science vol. 285, 2110 (1999), and e-print
cond-mat/0003407, directly support the linearity of the one-particle scattering
rate everywhere in the Brillouin zone we obtained here. We show that the origin
of this linearity is the strong linear in energy term of the imaginary part of
the carrier susceptibility. This result yields directly a linear in temperature
resistivity and linear in 1/energy optical conductivity. We show that the low
energy dependence of the susceptibility can have a purely fermionic origin. We
introduce an antiferromagnetic ansatz for the susceptibility of the
carriers.Inter alia, this ansatz may explain the appearance of the spin
resonance peak (observed in neutron scattering) in the normal state of the
cuprates. Further, we obtain particularly high transition temperatures $T_c$
from our Eliashberg scheme by using this ansatz: we have a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap
with $T_c > 120 ^o$K for nearest neighbour hopping $t=250meV$.

It is shown that the covariance matrix estimator (CME) is consistent for the
realistic cases (when systematic errors on the fitted parameters are not
extremely large comparing with the statistical ones) and its dispersion is
always smaller, than the dispersion of the simplified $\chi^2$ estimator
applied to the correlated data. The CME bias is negligible for the realistic
cases if the covariance matrix is calculated during the fit iteratively using
the parameter estimator itself. Analytical formula for the covariance matrix
inversion allows to perform fast and precise calculations even for very large
data sets. All this allows for efficient use of the CME in the global fits.

the momentum spectra of the backward going neutrons, which have the same
universal shape observed in earlier (inclusive) reactions induced by hadrons,
$\gamma$, $\nu$, and $\bar{\nu}$ beams. We also integrated the spectra and
determined the fraction of the hard scattering events which are in coincidence
with at least one neutron emitted into the back hemisphere, with momenta above

  Contrary to the earlier measurements which found that only a small fraction
(of the order of 10%) of the total inelastic cross section for light nuclei was
associated with backward going nucleons, we find that about half of the events
are of this nature. We speculate that the reason for the large difference is
the strong total center of mass (s) dependence of the hard reaction and short
range nucleon correlations in nuclei.
