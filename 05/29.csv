  the star formation history in the Universe","Accepted for publication in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Cosmic Background due to the integrated radiation from galaxies over the
whole life of the Universe is reviewed. We find that this background is well
constrained by measurements. The total power in the background is in the range
60-93 nW/m2/sr. The data show the existence of a minimum separating the direct
stellar radiation from the infrared part due to radiation reemitted by dust.
This reemitted dust radiation is about 1-2.6 time the background power in the
optical/near-IR thus much larger than the same ratio measured locally (30%).
The far-infrared and submillimeter background is likely to be dominated by
redshifted infrared galaxies. The long wavelength spectrum of the background
being significantly flatter than the spectrum of these galaxies it strongly
constrains the far-infrared radiation production rate history which must
increase by a factor larger than 10 between the present time and a redshift 1
and then stays rather constant at higher redshift, contrary to the ultraviolet
radiation production rate which decreases rapidly.
  Several models of galaxy evolution have been proposed to explain the
submillimeter background. In this paper we do not propose a new model; we
systematically explore the allowed range of evolution histories allowed by the
data. If infrared galaxies are mostly powered by starbursts as indicated by
recent observations, this infrared production history reflects the history of
starbursts in the Universe.

because it is almost unaffected by dust depletion. However, the use of zinc as
a tracer of metallicity evolution has been hampered by the difficulty of
detecting the Zn II resonance lines at high redshift. The measurement of zinc
abundance in a DLA system at z_abs > 3 obtained by means of the UVES
spectrograph at the VLT prompted us to re-analyse the full sample of zinc
abundances present in the literature to search for a metallicity-redshift
relation in DLA systems. The study of the metallicities of individual systems
shows evidence for an anti-correlation between [Zn/H] and redshift supported by
different types of statistical tools. The zinc metallicity decreases by -0.3
+/- 0.1 dex per unit redshift interval in the range 0.5 <~ z_abs <~ 3.5. This
rate is in good agreement with that found by Savaglio, Panagia & Stiavelli
(2000) in their recent study of DLA abundances corrected for dust depletion.
The present result does not require a knowledge of the dust depletion
pattern(s) in DLA systems. On the other hand, the analysis of the
column-density weighted metallicity of the sample, <Z>, does not show a clear
evidence for redshift evolution, consistent with previous studies of zinc
abundances. We propose that the apparent lack of evolution of <Z> is due to the
combination of selection bias effects together with the extreme sensitivity of
<Z> to low-number statistics.

BATSE 4B data into 588 long bursts (T$_{90}>2.5$ sec) and 149 short bursts
(T$_{90}<2.5$ sec), and compare the statistics calculated in each subgroup. The
$<V/V_{\rm max}>$ of the long bursts is $ 0.2901\pm 0.0113$, and that of the
short bursts is $0.4178\pm 0.0239$, which is a Euclidean value. For luminosity
function models, we consider a cylindrical-beam and a conic-beam. We take into
account the spatial distribution of GRB sources as well. A broad luminosity
function is naturally produced when one introduces beaming of GRBs. We
calculate the maximum detectable redshift of GRBs, $z_{\rm max}$. The estimated
$z_{\rm max}$ for the cylindrical-beam case is as high as $\sim 14$ for the
long bursts and $\sim 3$ for the short bursts. The large $z_{\rm max}$ value
for the short bursts is rather surprising in that the $<V/V_{\rm max}>$ for
this subgroup is close to the so-called Euclidean value, 0.5. We calculate the
fraction of bursts whose redshifts are larger than a certain redshift $z'$,
i.e. $f_{\rm > z'}$. When we take $z'=3.42$ and apply the luminosity function
derived for the cylindrical-beam, the expected $f_{\rm > z'}$ is $\sim 75 %$
for long bursts. When we increase the opening angle of the conic beam to
$\Delta \theta =3^\circ.0$, $f_{\rm > z'}$ decreases to $\sim 20 %$ at $ {\rm
z'=3.42}$. We conclude that the beaming-induced luminosity functions are
compatible with the redshift distribution of observed GRBs and that the
apparent Euclidean value of $<V/V_{\rm max}>$ may not be due to the Euclidean
space distribution but to the luminosity distribution.

Comparison of the faintest presently observed L-dwarfs with these dusty

diffusion and gravitational settling are taking place near the photosphere. As
the effective temperature decreases below $\te\approx 1300-1400$ K, the colors

and the statistical amount of uncertainty of Shannon, $S= -k \sum_{n}p_{n}\ln

energy and particle numbers are diagonal. These quantities satisfy the
inequality $S\geq H$. We propose to interprete Shannon's statistical inference
as specifying the {\em initial conditions} of the system in terms of $p_{n}$. A
definition of macroscopic observables which are characterized by intrinsic time
scales is given, and a quantum mechanical condition on the system, which
ensures equilibrium, is discussed on the basis of time averaging.
  An interesting analogy of the change of entroy with the running coupling in

approximation or the zero temperature limit. If such appealing concepts in
glass theory as configurational entropy are to have a meaning beyond these
approximations, one needs to cast them in a form involving states with finite
lifetimes.
  Starting from elementary examples and using results of Gaveau and Schulman,
we propose a simple expression for the configurational entropy and revisit the
question of taking flat averages over metastable states. The construction is
applicable to finite dimensional systems, and we explicitly show that for
simple mean-field glass models it recovers, justifies and generalises the known
results. The calculation emphasises the appearance of new dynamical order
parameters.

different classes of mounds, which are encompanied by characteristic diffusion

phases (parent and peritectic) grow competitively into a metastable liquid
phase of larger impurity content than either solid phase. When the parent or
both solid phases are morphologically unstable, i.e., for a small temperature
gradient/growth rate ratio ($G/v_p$), one solid phase usually outgrows and
covers the other phase, leading to a cellular-dendritic array structure closely
analogous to the one formed during monophase solidification of a dilute binary
alloy. In contrast, when $G/v_p$ is large enough for both phases to be
morphologically stable, the formation of the microstructurebecomes controlled
by a subtle interplay between the nucleation and growth of the two solid
phases. The structures that have been observed in this regime (in small samples
where convection effect are suppressed) include alternate layers (bands) of the
parent and peritectic phases perpendicular to the growth direction, which are
formed by alternate nucleation and lateral spreading of one phase onto the
other as proposed in a recent model [R. Trivedi, Metall. Mater. Trans. A 26, 1
(1995)], as well as partially filled bands (islands), where the peritectic
phase does not fully cover the parent phase which grows continuously. We
develop a phase-field model of peritectic solidification that incorporates
nucleation processes in order to explore the formation of these structures.
Simulations of this model shed light on the morphology transition from islands
to bands, the dynamics of spreading of the peritectic phase on the parent phase
following nucleation, which turns out to be characterized by a remarkably
constant acceleration, and the types of growth morphology that one might expect
to observe in large samples under purely diffusive growth conditions.

be correlated even at distances exceeding the local cosmological horizon. By

space-time dimensions. The extra time-like dimension is a gauge artifact and
can be eliminated by choosing a gauge in which the SO(10,1) Lorentz symmetry is
manifest. The effective theory of string observables is the 11d supergravity.
The same theory compactified on T^2 provides a non-perturbative unified picture
of the Type IIA, Type IIB and 11d supergravity. This is confirmed by explicit
determination of the R^4-terms which are finite and manifestly SL(2,Z)
invariant as expected by the U-duality conjecture in nine non-compact
dimensions with maximal supersymmetry.

nonlinear dynamical systems close to a bifurcation of a periodic motion, such
as in excitable systems. We demonstrate that coherence resonance can be
observed in systems close to a {\sl blowout bifurcation}. It is shown that for
dynamical systems with an invariant subspace in which there is a phase-coherent
chaotic attractor, the interplay among the oscillation of local transverse
stability, noise and nonlinearity can lead to coherence resonance phenomenon.
The mechanism of coherence resonance in this type of system is different from
that in previously studied systems.

type, corresponding to systems with broken time-reversal invariance. Deviations
from unitarity are characterized by rank $M\le N$ and a set of eigenvalues

process with a form of time reversal symmetry. Particle reservoirs placed at
both ends of the system induce a density current which drives the system out of
equilibrium. The phase space distribution is singular in the stationary state
and has a cumulative form expressed in terms of generalized Takagi functions.
The entropy production rate is computed using the coarse-graining formalism of
Gaspard, Gilbert and Dorfman. In the continuum limit, we show that the value of
the entropy production rate is independent of the coarse-graining and agrees
with the phenomenological entropy production rate of irreversible
thermodynamics.
