GRB 970508 with the CAM and PHT instruments on May 21 and 24, 1997 and with PHT
in three filters in November 1997. A source at 60 $\mu$m (flux in May of $66\pm
10$ mJy) was detected near the position of the host galaxy of this
$\gamma$--ray burst. The source was detected again in November 1997, at a
marginally lower flux ($43\pm 13$ mJy). A Galactic cirrus origin and a stellar
origin for the emission can be ruled out on the basis of the infrared colours.
The marginal evidence for variability in the 60 $\mu$m flux between May and
November is not sufficient to warrant interpretation of the source as transient
fireball emission. However, the infrared colours are physically reasonable if
attributed to conventional dust emission from a single blackbody source. The
probability of detecting a 60 $\mu$m by chance in a PHT beam down to a
detection limit of 50 mJy is $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$. If the source is at the
redshift of the host galaxy of the $\gamma$--ray burst the fluxes and upper
limits at wavelengths from 12 $\mu$m to 170 $\mu$m indicate it is an
ultraluminous infrared galaxy (L$_{\rm ir} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ L$_{\sun}$).
The star formation rate is estimated to be several hundred solar masses per
year, depending significantly on model-dependent parameters. If this source is
associated with the host galaxy of GRB 970508, progenitor models which
associate GRBs with star-forming regions are favoured.

the reionization of hydrogen and helium, and has important consequences for our
understanding of the Lya forest and of galaxy formation in gravitational models
of large-scale structure. We measure the temperature-density relation of
intergalactic gas from Lya forest observations of eight quasar spectra with
high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, using a new line fitting technique
to obtain a lower cutoff of the distribution of line widths from which the
temperature is derived. We carefully test the accuracy of this technique to
recover the gas temperature with a hydrodynamic simulation. The temperature at
redshift z=(3.9, 3.0, 2.4) is best determined at densities slightly above the
mean: T_star=(20200\pm2700, 20200\pm1300, 22600\pm1900)K (statistical error
bars) for gas density (in units of the mean density) Delta_star=(1.42\pm0.08,
1.37\pm0.11, 1.66\pm0.11). The power-law index of the temperature-density
relation, defined by T=T_star(Delta/Delta_star)^{gamma-1}, is gamma-1=
(0.43\pm0.45, 0.29\pm0.30, 0.52\pm0.14) for the same three redshifts. The
temperature at the fixed over-density Delta=1.4 is T_1.4=(20100\pm2800,
20300\pm1400, 20700\pm1900)K. These temperatures are higher than expected for
photoionized gas in ionization equilibrium with a cosmic background, and can be
explained by a gradual additional heating due to on-going HeII reionization.
The measurement of the temperature reduces one source of uncertainty in the
lower limit to the baryon density implied by the observed mean flux decrement.
We find that the temperature cannot be reliably measured for under-dense gas,
because the velocities due to expansion always dominate the widths of the
corresponding weak lines.

both by extrapolating timing solutions to inter-glitch intervals and by
phase-coherent timing fits across the glitch(es). Analysis of glitch

that most glitches have a fractional amplitude $\Delta\nu_g/\nu$ of between
$10^{-8}$ and $10^{-6}$. There is no consistent relationship between glitch
amplitude and the time since the previous glitch or the time to the following

recognised, the largest glitch activity is seen in pulsars with ages of order

timing irregularity in which there is a significant increase in pulse frequency
over a few days, accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of the slowdown
rate. Fits of an exponential recovery to post-glitch data show that for most

conditions. In spite of the scale-free cosmological nature of the problem, the
collapse of individual objects is not self-similar. Unlike most of previous
calculations the dynamics used here relies only on adiabatic invariants and not
on self-similarity. The paper focuses on the structure of the innermost part of
the collapsed halos and addresses the problem of central density cusps. The
slopes of density profiles at 1% of virial radius are calculated for a variety
of cosmological models and are found to vary with the mass of the halos and
power spectrum of the initial conditions. The inner slopes range between r^-2.3
and r^-2 with the limiting case of r^-2 reached for the largest masses. The
steep cusps found here correspond to the limiting case where all particles move
on radial orbits. The introduction of angular momentum will make the density
profile shallower. We expect this to resolve the discrepancy found between the
calculated profiles and the ones found in high resolution N-body simulations,
where the exponent ranges from -0.5 to -1.5. The robust prediction here is that
collisionless gravitational collapse in an expanding universe is expected to
form density cups and not halos with a core structure.

Significant spectral curvature is detected for the 6 quasars with the highest

parameterized as a flattening of the underlying power law by Delta_alpha ~ 0.5
above ~1 keV. We find that quasars with a steeper soft X-ray (0.1-2 keV)
spectrum tend to be steeper also at higher (2-10 keV) energies. The
distribution of the best fit 2-10 keV slopes is similar to that found for other
radio-quiet AGN and characterized by a large dispersion around the mean:
alpha_E ~ 1.0+/-0.3. Iron K_alpha lines are detected in 4 quasars. In the
narrow-line quasar PG 1115+407, the rest frame line energy (6.69+/-0.11 keV)
and equivalent width (580+/-280 eV) are consistent with those found in a few
low redshift narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1). This, together with the
similarity of the 0.1-10 keV X-ray continuum, suggests that this quasar is the
higher redshift and luminosity analog of a NLSy1. In the broad line quasar PG
0947+396, the rest-frame line energy suggests fluorescence from cold iron. The
line equivalent width (> 400 eV) is however about 2-3 times higher than that
usually found in Seyfert 1 galaxies. The high energy power-law slopes and the
iron line emission properties seem to be unrelated to the X-ray luminosity.

_p$, of each source is estimated by fitting the data with a parabolic function.
In the plot of $\alpha_{rx}-\log \nu_p$ we find that, in the four different
regions divided by the $\alpha_{rx}=0.75$ line and the $\log \nu_p=14.7$ line,
all the RBL-like objects are inside the upper left region, while most XBL-like
objects are within the lower right region. A few sources are located in the
lower left region. No sources are in the upper right region. This result is
rather quantitative. It provides an evidence supporting what Giommi et al.
(1995) suggested: RBL-like and XBL-like objects can be distinguished by the
difference of the peak emission frequency of the overall energy spectrum.

components of extragalactic sources is not less than that of Galactic sources,
the value of $H_0$ can be estimated at a high level of accuracy. The assumption
is reasonable due to the general belief that the activity in the core of
galaxies must be more powerful than that of stars. This method is simple and
with only one uncertainty --- the real velocity of components. This uncertainty
is related to the value of the real velocity of componenets of Galactic sources
and the latter is always well-determined (note that the determination is
independent of $H_0$ and the distance of Galactic sources can be directly
measured at a rather high level of accuracy). Hopefully the method will play an
important role in future research to fix the value of $H_0$. With the data of
the three sources available so far and the assumption that the real velocity of
componenets of at least one of the sources is not less than a known velocity of
componenets of a Galactic source, the constant is estimated to be within

allow the determination of the proportionality constant between frequency shift

departure, we carry out a non-perturbative quantization of the sector of
general relativity, coupled to matter, admitting non-rotating isolated horizons
as inner boundaries. The emphasis is on the quantum geometry of the horizon.
Polymer excitations of the bulk quantum geometry pierce the horizon endowing it
with area. The intrinsic geometry of the horizon is then described by the
quantum Chern-Simons theory of a U(1) connection on a punctured 2-sphere, the
horizon. Subtle mathematical features of the quantum Chern-Simons theory turn
out to be important for the existence of a coherent quantum theory of the
horizon geometry. Heuristically, the intrinsic geometry is flat everywhere
except at the punctures. The distributional curvature of the U(1) connection at
the punctures gives rise to quantized deficit angles which account for the
overall curvature. For macroscopic black holes, the logarithm of the number of
these horizon microstates is proportional to the area, irrespective of the
values of (non-gravitational) charges. Thus, the black hole entropy can be
accounted for entirely by the quantum states of the horizon geometry. Our
analysis is applicable to all non-rotating black holes, including the
astrophysically interesting ones which are very far from extremality.
Furthermore, cosmological horizons (to which statistical mechanical
considerations are known to apply) are naturally incorporated. An effort has
been made to make the paper self-contained by including short reviews of the
background material.

lift the arbitrariness in the Hamiltonian framework. An alternative covariant

hypothesis about the bulk or about other boundary components, so one may speak
of holographic charges. It is well known that the asymptotic symmetries that
lead to conserved charges are really defined at infinity, but the choice of
boundary conditions and surface terms in the action and in the charges is
usually determined through integration by parts whereas each component of the
boundary should be considered separately. We treat the example of gravity (for
any space-time dimension, with or without cosmological constant), formulated as
an Affine theory which is a natural generalization of the Palatini and
Cartan-Weyl (vielbein) first order formulations. We then show that the
superpotential associated to a Dirichlet boundary condition on the metric (the
one needed to treat asymptotically flat or AdS spacetimes) is the one proposed

nonperturbative instanton vacuum has been numerically evaluated. Our formalism
makes it possible to express the topological susceptibility and the mass of the

the quartic anharmonic oscillator: its zero-energy spectral determinants

from the dynamical nature of a time-orbiting-potential (TOP) trap was observed
experimentally. The orbital micromotion of the condensate in velocity space at
the frequency of the rotating bias field of the TOP was detected by a
time-of-flight method. A dependence of the equilibrium position of the atoms on
the sense of rotation of the bias field was observed. We have compared our
experimental findings with numerical simulations. The nonadiabatic following of
the atomic spin in the trap rotating magnetic field produces geometric forces
acting on the trapped atoms.

for systems with more than two subsystems. We consider three approaches to this
problem for three-qubit states: choosing a basis which puts the state into a
standard form, enumerating ``local invariants,'' and using operational
quantities such as the number of maximally entangled states which can be
distilled. In this paper we evaluate a particular standard form, the {\it
Schmidt form}, which is a generalization of the Schmidt decomposition for
bipartite pure states. We show how the coefficients in this case can be
parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful local invariants; we use
this form to prove the efficacy of a particular distillation technique for GHZ
triplets; and we relate the yield of GHZs to classes of states with unusual
entanglement properties, showing that these states represent extremes of
distillability as functions of two local invariants.

  Report",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.62.054301",,"quant-ph",,"  It is known that entanglement swapping can be used to realize entanglement
purifying. By this way, two particles belong to different non-maximally
entangled pairs can be projected probabilisticly to a maximally entangled state
or to a less entangled state. In this report, we show, when the less entangled
state is obtained, if a unitary transformation is introduced locally, then a
maximally entangled state can be obtained probabilisticly from this less
entangled state. The total successful probability of our scheme is equal to the
entanglement of a single pairpurification (if two original pairs are in the
same non-maximally entangled states) or to the smaller entanglement of a single
pair purification of these two pairs (if two original pairs are not in the same
non-maximally entangled states). The advantage of our scheme is no continuous
indefinite iterative procedure is needed to achieve optimal purifying.
