  spectra","submitted to ApJ April 28 2000; 9 pages of text plus 15 figures",,"10.1086/318250",,"astro-ph",,"  X-ray illumination of accretion disks is an invaluable diagnostic of the
structure of these disks because of the associated iron K$\alpha$ emission.
Here we point out that the resulting reflected spectra depend very sensitively
on the geometry of the X-ray source, and that this fact can be efficiently used
to test these models observationally. In particular, we discuss three different
accretion disk geometries: the ``lamppost model'', accretion disks with
magnetic flares, and the model with a full corona overlying a cold thin disk.
We show that in the case of the lamppost model, unless the X-ray luminosity of
the central source is larger than that of the cold disk by a factor of 10 or
more, a significant fraction of iron in the ionized skin of the disk is in the
hydrogen and helium-like ions. Because these ions have large fluorescence
yields, the resulting reflected spectra look strongly ionized, with Equivalent
Width (EW) of the line {\em increasing} with X-ray luminosity $L_x$ up to the
maximum of $\sim 500$ eV. This situation contrasts to the magnetic flare model,
where the large X-ray flux near flares completely ionizes the skin of the disk
and thus the resulting spectra appear to be that from a neutral material. The
line EW in this model {\em anti-correlates} with X-ray luminosity, and becomes
arbitrarily small when $L_x$ is a good fraction of the Eddington luminosity.
Finally, in the full corona case, due to the additional pressure and weight of
the corona, the gas pressure (and its density) below the corona is always large
enough to make the gas very cool and effectively neutral. No highly ionized
skin forms in such a model. If the corona is Thomson thin, then EW of the line
does not depend on the accretion disk or corona luminosities for the full
corona model.

X-ray Timing Explorer spanning 250 days and covering the entire double-peaked
eruption that occurred from 1998 September until 1999 May. The spectra are fit
to a model including multicolor blackbody disk and power-law components. The
source is observed in the very high and high/soft outburst states of black hole
X-ray novae. During the very high state, when the power-law component dominated
the spectrum, the inner disk radius is observed to vary by more than an order
of magnitude; the radius decreased by a factor of 16 in one day during a 6.8
Crab flare. If the larger of these observed radii is taken to be the last
stable orbit, then the smaller observed radius would imply that the inner edge
of the disk is inside the event horizon! However, we conclude that the apparent
variations of the inner disk radius observed during periods of increased
power-law emission are probably caused by the failure of the multicolor
disk/power-law model; the actual physical radius of the inner disk may remain
fairly constant. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the observed
inner disk radius remains approximately constant over 120 days in the high
state, when the power-law component is weak, even though the disk flux and
total flux vary by an order of magnitude. The mass of the black hole inferred
by equating the approximately constant inner disk radius observed in the
high/soft state with the last stable orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole is
M_BH = 7.4 M_sun (D/6 kpc) (cos i)^{-1/2}.

some of the features predicted by standard theories of star and planet
formation, but systems with massive planets having very small orbital radii and
large eccentricities are common and were generally unexpected. Other techniques
being used to search for planetary signatures include accurate measurement of
positional (astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing, and pulsar
timing, the latter resulting in the detection of the first planetary mass
bodies beyond our Solar System in 1992. The transit of a planet across the face
of the host star provides significant physical diagnostics, and the first such
detection was announced in 1999. Protoplanetary disks, which represent an
important evolutionary stage for understanding planet formation, are being
imaged from space. In contrast, direct imaging of extra-solar planets
represents an enormous challenge. Long-term efforts are directed towards
infrared space interferometry, the detection of Earth-mass planets, and
measurement of their spectral characteristics. Theoretical atmospheric models
provide predictions of planetary temperatures, radii, albedos, chemical
condensates, and spectral features as a function of mass, composition and
distance from the host star. Efforts to characterise planets occupying the
`habitable zone', in which liquid water may be present, and indicators of the

accretion flow geometries for AGN -- the lamppost model frequently used to
discuss the iron line reverberation in AGN, and the model where the X-rays are
produced in magnetic flares above a cold accretion disk (AD). The lamppost
spectra contain several spectroscopic features characteristic of highly ionized
material that are not seen in the X-ray spectra of most AGN. The magnetic flare
model, on the other hand, produces reflected spectra that are roughly a
super-position of a power-law and a {\em neutral-like} reflection and iron
K$\alpha$ line, and are thus more in line with typical AGN X-ray spectra.
Furthermore, because of the difference in the ionization structure of the
illuminated material in the two models, the line equivalent width increases
with the X-ray luminosity, $L_x$, for the lamppost, and decreases with $L_x$
for the flare model. In light of these theoretical insights, recent iron line
reverberation studies of AGN, the X-ray Baldwin effect, and the general lack of
X-ray reflection features in distant quasars all suggest that, for high
accretion rates, the cold accretion disk is covered by a Thomson thick,
completely ionized skin. Because the latter is only possible when the X-rays
are concentrated to small emitting regions, we believe that this presents a
strong evidence for the magnetic flare origin of X-rays in AGN.

subsequently discovered with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) about 42h after

is enhanced by about 0.2 dex and oxygen is unaltered. Among other mixing-

significant contribution to the dipole around 200 hMpc. The overall
misalignment with the CMB dipole remains at 20degrees. The implied value of
beta is in the range 0.40-0.55 with statistical error +-0.1. We also present
the density field and a preliminary dipole analysis from the almost completed
Behind The Plane survey, which extends the PSCz to cover 93% of the sky
including the proposed core of the Great Attractor. We find a density peak at
(325,-5,3500km/s), about half as massive as Centaurus or Pavo-Indus, and
forming part of a continuous filament linking them across the Plane. We also
find evidence for a much larger `Greater Attractor' directly behind the GA, at
a distance of 125 hMpc, and more massive than the Shapley concentration.
  At large distances the dipole direction is in much improved agreement with
the CMB: at 250-300hMpc, the misalignment is only 5-10 degrees, though this

Their internal dimensionless rotational parameter is beta=0.03, independent of

solar wind results in an enhancement of its proton flux along the polar
directions, several observations indicate a wind proton flux peaked at the

equations describing the axisymmetric outflow of plasma from the magnetized and
rotating Sun, either in its present form of the solar wind, or, in its earlier
form of a protosolar wind. Special attention is directed towards the
collimation properties of the solar outflow at large heliocentric distances.
For the present day solar wind it is found that the poloidal streamlines and
fieldlines are only slightly focused toward the solar poles. However, even such
a modest compression of the flow by the azimuthal magnetic field would lead to
an increase of the mass flux at the polar axis by about 20% at 1 AU, relatively
to its value at the equator, for an initially isotropic at the base wind,
contrary to older and recent (Prognoz, Ulysses, SOHO) observations. For the
anisotropic in heliolatitude wind with parameters at the base inferred from in
situ observations by ULYSSES/SWOOPS and SOHO/CDS the effect of collimation is
almost totally compensated by the initial velocity and density anisotropy of
the wind. This effect should be taken into account in the interpretation of the
recent SOHO observations by the SWAN instrument. Similar simulations have been
performed for a five- and ten-fold increase of the solar angular velocity
corresponding presumably to the wind of an earlier phase of our Sun. For such
conditions it is found that for initially radial streamlines, the azimuthal
magnetic field created by the fast rotation focus them toward the rotation axis
and forms a tightly collimated jet.

the radial velocities of 422 carbon stars. New aspects of this analysis include
the propagation of uncertainties in the LMC proper motion with a Monte Carlo,
and a self-consistent modeling of the rotation curve and disk kinematics. The
rotation curve is well fit by a truncated, finite-thickness exponential disk
model with no dark halo. The velocity dispersion in radial bins decreases from
22 to 15 km/s, then increases to 20 km/s at larger radii. Constant-thickness
models in virial equilibrium cannot be reconciled with the data even if the
effects of LMC or Galactic dark halos are included. If the disk is virialized,
the LMC disk is flared. We model the velocity dispersion at large radii (R > 6
kpc) as a maximal flared disk under the influence of the Galactic dark halo,
which favors a mean density for the latter of 0.00025 M_sol/pc^3 at the LMC
distance. LMC stellar kinematics play an important role in elucidating the
nature of MACHOs, a dark population inferred from LMC microlensing. We have
constructed a truncated and flared maximal disk model for the LMC which is
kinematically based. Our model does not include a nonvirialized component such
as tidal debris. Our upper limit on the self-lensing optical depth is in good
agreement with that obtained from less sophisticated models, and is an order of
magnitude too small to account for the MACHO microlensing signal [Abridged].

condensation (FC) is extended to high-temperature superconductors. Within our
model, the appearance of FC presents a boundary separating the region of a
strongly interacting electron liquid from the region of a strongly correlated
electron liquid. We study the superconductivity of a strongly correlated liquid
and show that under certain conditions, the superconductivity vanishes at
temperatures $T>T_c\simeq T_{node}$, with the superconducting gap being
smoothly transformed into a pseudogap. As the result, the pseudogap occupies
only a part of the Fermi surface. The gapped area shrinks with increasing the
temperature and vanishes at $T=T^*$. The single-particle excitation width is
also studied. The quasiparticle dispersion in systems with FC can be
represented by two straight lines characterized by the respective effective
masses $M^*_{FC}$ and $M^*_L$, and intersecting near the binding energy that is
of the order of the superconducting gap. It is argued that this strong change
of the quasiparticle dispersion at the binding can be enhanced in underdoped
samples because of strengthening the FC influence. The FC phase transition in
the presence of the superconductivity is examined, and it is shown that this
phase transition can be considered as kinetic energy driven.

As a result we obtain a modified formulation for the BEC of three-charged

physical connection between our modified formulation and the core-halo model

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments by Bell's inequalities and quantum
nonlocality. We show, in this paper, that identical correlations arise, if the
phase relations of electromagnetic fields are considered. In particular, we
proceed from an analysis of a one-photon model. The correlation probability in
this case contains a phase relation cos(b - a) between the two settings. In the
two photon model the phases of the photon's electromagnetic fields are related
at the origin. It is shown that this relation can be translated into a
linearity requirement for electromagnetic fields between the two polarizers.
Along these lines we compute the correlation integral with an expression
conserving linearity. This expression, as shown, correctly describes the
measured values. It seems thus that quantum nonlocality can be seen as a
combination of boundary conditions on possible electromagnetic fields between
the polarizers and a relation of the electromagnetic fields of the two photons
via a phase. We expect the same feature to arise in every experiment, where
joint probabilities of separate polarization measurements are determined.

A vol 34, 93 (2001).","10.1088/0305-4470/34/1/307",,"quant-ph",,"  Any method for estimating the ensemble average of arbitrary operator
(observables or not, including the density matrix) relates the quantity of
interest to a complete set of observables, i.e. a quorum}. This corresponds to
an expansion on an irreducible set of operators in the Liouville space. We give
two general characterizations of these sets. All the known unbiased
reconstruction techniques, i.e. ``quantum tomographies'', can be described in
this framework. New operatorial resolutions are given that can be used to
implement novel reconstruction schemes.

observe electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) at the $^{87}$Rb D$_{2}$
line. Radiations of two independent external-cavity semiconductor lasers were
used in the experiment, the current of one of them being modulated at a
frequency equal to the hyperfine-splitting frequency of the excited 5P$_{3/2}$
level. In this case, apart from the main EIT dip corresponding to the
two-photon Raman resonance in a three-level $\Lambda$-scheme, additional dips
detuned from the main dip by a frequency equal to the frequency of the HF
generator were observed in the absorption spectrum. These dips were due to an
increase in the medium transparency at frequencies corresponding to the
three-photon Raman resonances in four-level N-type schemes. The resonance
shapes are analyzed as functions of generator frequency and magnetic field.
