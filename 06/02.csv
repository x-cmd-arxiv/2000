strange stars, are explored. Strange stars are very likely to have atmospheres
with typical mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-15}M_\odot$ but bare polar caps almost
throughout their lifetimes, if they are produced during supernova explosions. A
direct consequence of the bare polar cap is that the binding energies of both
positively and negatively charged particles at the bare quark surface are
nearly infinity, so that the vacuum polar gap sparking scenario as proposed by
Ruderman & Sutherland should operate above the cap, regardless of the sense of
the magnetic pole with respect to the rotational pole. Heat can not accumulate
on the polar cap region due to the large thermal conductivity on the bare quark
surface. We test this ``bare polar cap strange star'' (BPCSS) idea with the
present broad band emission data of pulsars, and propose several possible
criteria to distinguish BPCSSs from neutron stars.

z=13 kpc above the plane in one of two vertically oriented long slits -- making
this the spiral galaxy with the greatest spectroscopically detected halo extent
in emission. Key diagnostic line ratios have been measured up to about z=8 kpc,
allowing the source of ionization and physical state to be probed. Ionization
by a dilute radiation field from massive stars in the disk can explain some of
the line ratio behavior, but departures from this picture are clearly
indicated, most strongly by the rise of [OIII]/Halpha with z. Velocities of the
gas in both slits approach the systemic velocity of the galaxy at several kpc
above the plane. We interpret this trend as a decrease in rotation velocity
with z, with essentially no rotation at heights of several kpc. Such a trend
was observed in the edge-on galaxy NGC 891, but here much more dramatically.
This falloff is presumably due to the gravitational potential changing with z,
but will also depend on the hydrodynamic nature of the disk-halo cycling of gas
and projection effects. More detailed modeling of the ionization and kinematics
of this and other edge-ons will be presented in future papers.

$\lambda$ and the equation of state $\omega_{\Psi}$. With these potentials, the
fine tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems are ameliorated for both dark

For the scalar dark matter, we clarify the meaning of a scalar Jeans lenght and

scales having a wave number $k > k_{min,\Phi}$, where $k_{min,\Phi} \simeq 4.5

notably diffuse objects. HII regions located in interarm gaps are
preferentially less luminous than counterparts which constitute M51's
grand-design spiral arms and are best fit with a power-law slope of alpha =

crust-core boundary. The magnitude of this damping, evaluated by Bildsten and
Ushomirsky (BU) under the assumption of a perfectly rigid crust, sets the
maximum spin frequency for a neutron star spun up by accretion in a Low-Mass
X-ray binary (LMXB). In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between
the core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density
neutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin
frequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This
reduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared
to the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of
10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal
possible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of
the crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very
sensitive to the physical thickness of the crust. If the crust is sufficiently
thick, the curve of the critical spin frequency for the onset of the r-mode
instability becomes multi-valued for some temperatures; this is related to the
avoided crossings between the r-mode and the higher-order torsional modes in
the crust. The critical frequencies are comparable to the observed spins of
neutron stars in LMXBs and millisecond pulsars.

be born close to massive stars, in some cases within tenths of a pc. If the
disks have lifetimes greater than those of the more massive stars, they are
exposed to the radiation fields and gas flows from the late evolutionary phases
and supernovae of the massive stars. The fast flows from supernovae are likely
to give some stripping of mass from the disks, but do not typically lead to
complete disruption of the disks. In the slow wind from a red supergiant star,
there is the possibility of gravitational accretion of wind matter onto the
circumstellar disk. In the supernova explosion of a red supergiant, the
radiative flux at the time of shock breakout can heat and ionize a nearby disk,
leading to transient, narrow line emission. There are consequences for the
solar nebula if it was born ~0.2 pc from a massive star that became a red
supergiant. Accretion from the wind could supply a substantial amount of 26Al
to the disk. The high radiative luminosity of the eventual supernova could lead
to the melting of dust grains and the formation of chondrules. The passage of
the supernova ejecta could drive a shock wave in the disk, heating it.

highly relativistic wind from the pulsar passes through a shock front in which
the particles attain a power law energy distribution. The electrons and
positrons lose energy radiating synchrotron emission. Here, a one zone version
of the model is developed and applied to observations of X-ray pulsar nebulae.
Efficient conversion of pulsar spin-down power to X-ray luminosity is expected
if the observed electrons are in the synchrotron cooling regime and their
energy spectrum is similar to that in the Crab Nebula. In this case, the
relation between X-ray luminosity and pulsar spin-down power depends only
weakly on the model parameters. The dependence is stronger for a steeper
particle spectrum, as appears to be present in N157B, and the efficiency of
X-ray production can be lower. If the electrons are not in the cooling regime,
the X-ray luminosity can be low, as appears to be the case for the compact
nebula around the Vela pulsar. Slow cooling is likely to be caused by a
sub-equipartition magnetic field in the radiating region. Observations can
place constraints on the uncertain physics of relativistic MHD shocks. The
model is related to those developed for gamma-ray burst afterglows.

across various wavebands is determined {\em both} by halo properties and star
formation in the disk; (b) TF scatter owes primarily to the spread in formation
redshifts. The scatter can be measurably reduced by chemical evolution, and
also in some cases by the weak anti-correlation between peak height and spin;
(c) multi-wavelength constraints can be important in distinguishing between
models which appear to fit the TF relation in I or K; (d) successful models
seem to require that the bulk of disk formation cannot occur too early (z>2) or
too late (z<0.5), and are inconsistent with high values of $\Omega_0$; (e) a
realistic model with the above ingredients can reasonably reproduce the
observed z=0 TF relation in {\em all} bands (B, R, I, and K). It can also
account for the z=1 B-band TF relation and yield rough agreement with the local
B and K luminosity functions and B-band surface-brightness--magnitude relation.
The remarkable agreement with observations suggests that the amount of gas that
is expelled or poured into a disk galaxy must be small, and that the specific
angular momentum of the baryons must roughly equal that of the halo; there is
little room for angular momentum transfer. In an appendix we present analytic
fits to stellar-population synthesis models.

The kinetics of the induced excitonic polarization is calculated within
Markovian equations both for subcritical and supercritical excitation with
respect to a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). For excited densities n below
the critical density n_c, an exponential polarization decay is obtained, which
is characterized by a dephasing rate G=1/T_2. This dephasing rate due to phonon
scattering shows a pronounced exciton-density dependence in the vicinity of the
phase transition. It is well described by the power law G (n-n_c)^2 that can be
understood by linearization of the equations around the equilibrium solution.
Above the critical density we get a non-exponential relaxation to the final
condensate value p^0 with |p(t)|-|p^0| ~1/t that holds for all densities.
Furthermore we include the full self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
terms due to the exciton-exciton interaction and the kinetics of the anomalous
functions F_k= <a_k a_{-k}>. The collision terms are analyzed and an
approximation is used which is consistent with the existence of BEC. The
inclusion of the coherent x-x interaction does not change the dephasing laws.

using the activation-relaxation technique (ART). This method defines events in
the configurational energy landscape as a two-step process: (a) a configuration
is first activated from a local minimum to a nearby saddle-point and (b) is
then relaxed to a new minimum. Although ART has been applied with success to a
wide range of materials such as a-Si, a-SiO2 and binary Lennard-Jones glasses,
questions remain regarding the biases of the technique. We address some of
these questions in a detailed study of ART-generated events in Lennard-Jones
(LJ) clusters, a system for which much is already known. In particular, we
study the distribution of saddle-points, the pathways between configurations,
and the reversibility of paths. We find that ART can identify all trajectories

symmetry of the chiral sector of the theory in each vacuum, which acts on the

perform calculations in a controlled weakly-coupled way for small radius. The
dominant contributions to the path integral on the cylinder arise from magnetic
monopoles which play the role of instanton constituents. We find that the
semi-classically generated superpotential of the theory is the affine Toda
potential for an associated twisted affine algebra. We determine the
supersymmetric vacua and calculate the values of the gluino condensate. The
number of supersymmetric vacua is equal to c_2, the dual Coxeter number, and in
each vacuum the monopoles carry a fraction 1/c_2 of topological charge. As the
results are independent of the radius of the circle, they are also valid in the
strong coupling regime where the theory becomes decompactified. In this way we
obtain values for the gluino condensate which for the classical gauge groups
agree with previously known ``weak coupling instanton'' expressions (but not
with the ``strong coupling instanton'' calculations). This detailed agreement
provides further evidence in favour of the recently advocated resolution of the
the gluino condensate puzzle. We also make explicit predictions for the gluino

the functional dependence of the phase functions on the antisymmetric star

renormalization of vertex operators in the open string sector. Using
world-sheet duality we clarify the regimes of finite and zero momentum transfer
between boundaries, demonstrating the existence of poles in the nonplanar

renormalizability of open and closed string theory in the Wilsonian sense. We

studying the appropriate amplitude equations. The conservation law leads to a
large-scale neutral mode that must be included in the asymptotic analysis for
pattern formation near onset. Near a stationary bifurcation, the usual
Ginzburg--Landau equation for the amplitude of the pattern is then coupled to
an equation for the large-scale mode. These amplitude equations show that for
certain parameters all roll-type solutions are unstable. This new instability
differs from the Eckhaus instability in that it is amplitude-driven and is
supercritical. Beyond the stability boundary, there exist stable stationary
solutions in the form of strongly modulated patterns. The envelope of these
modulations is calculated in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and, away from
the onset of modulation, is closely approximated by a sech profile. Numerical
simulations indicate that as the modulation becomes more pronounced, the
envelope broadens. A number of applications are considered, including
convection with fixed-flux boundaries and convection in a magnetic field,
resulting in new instabilities for these systems.

  Developments', November 4-6, 1999, Unversity of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  There is a newly emerging understanding that in the chaotic domain of
isolated finite interacting many particle systems smoothed densities define the
statistical description of these systems and these densities follow from
embedded (two-body) random matrix ensembles and their various deformations.
These ensembles predict that the smoothed form of matrix elements of a
transition operator between the chaotic eigenstates weighted by the densities
at the two ends (i.e. the bivariate strength density) will be a bivariate
Gaussian with the bivariate correlation coefficient arising out of the
non-commutability of the hamiltonian and the transition operator involved. The
ensemble theory extends to systems with a mean-field and a chaos generating
two-body interaction (as in nuclei, atoms and diffusive quantum dots). These
developments in many-body quantum chaos are described with special reference to
one-body transition operators.

depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2^n
with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our
circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for
approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log
(n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)^2 log log n) on the
circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2^n, for which the best previous bound was
O(n^2).
  As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring
algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and
polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and
post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that
factoring is in the complexity class ZPP^BQNC, where BQNC is the class of
problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with
poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.
  Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of
approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above
upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of
epsilon).
