Approximation (PIZA), for use with realistic galaxy redshift surveys. PIZA is a
linear particle-based Lagrangian method which uses the present day positions of
galaxies to reconstruct both the initial density field and the present day
peculiar velocity field. We generalize the method by mapping galaxy positions
from redshift-space to real-space in the Local Group frame, and take the
selection function into account by minimizing the mass weighted action. We have
applied our new method to mock galaxy catalogues, and find it offers an
improvement in the accuracy of reconstructions over linear theory. We have
applied our method to the all-sky IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift Survey.
Applying PIZA to PSCz, we are able to obtain the peculiar velocity field, the
dipole, bulk velocities, and the distortion parameter. From the dipole, we find
that beta=0.51+/-0.14. We compare the PSCz bulk velocity with that of Mk III
and conclude that beta=0.5+/-0.15. We compare the PSCz dipole with that of SFI

arguments used in the design of distributed protocols. Communication in a
distributed system can be viewed as the act of transforming the system's state
of knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for formalizing and
reasoning about knowledge in distributed systems. We argue that states of
knowledge of groups of processors are useful concepts for the design and
analysis of distributed protocols. In particular, distributed knowledge
corresponds to knowledge that is ``distributed'' among the members of the
group, while common knowledge corresponds to a fact being ``publicly known''.
The relationship between common knowledge and a variety of desirable actions in
a distributed system is illustrated. Furthermore, it is shown that, formally
speaking, in practical systems common knowledge cannot be attained. A number of
weaker variants of common knowledge that are attainable in many cases of
interest are introduced and investigated.

Experimental feasibility of detecting CP violation effects in top quark
production and decays in high energy e+ e-, gamma-gamma, mu+ mu-, pp and p-bar

chromo-electric dipole moments of the top quark in e+ e- -> t-bar t and in p p

for experiments, e.g., tree-level CP violation in e+ e- -> t-bar t h, t-bar t
Z, t-bar t nu_e-bar nu_e and in the top decay t -> b tau nu_tau and CP

energetically preferred phase exhibits ``color-spin-locking'', i.e. the color

this phase and argue that it shares important features of the hadronic phase at
low density. In particular, we find an unbroken rotational symmetry, spin 3/2
quasiparticles, and an unusual mechanism for quark-anti-quark condensation. Our
results are relevant to three flavor QCD in the regime where the strange quark
mass is bigger than the critical value for color-flavor-locking. We find that

the presence of both infrared and ultraviolet (spatial) cut-offs. These are
crucial in ensuring the presence of mass gaps in scalar matter propagating in
the D-particle recoil space time. The analogy of this problem with the
Liouville-string approach to QCD, suggested earlier by John Ellis and one of
the present authors, prompts us to identify the resulting scalar masses with
those obtained in the supergravity approach based on the Maldacena's
conjecture, but without the imposition of any supersymmetry in our case. Within
reasonable numerical uncertainties, we observe that agreement is obtained
between the two approaches for a particular value of the ratio of the two
cut-offs of the recoil geometry. Notably, our approach does not suffer from the
ambiguities of the supergravity approach as regards the validity of the
comparison of the glueball masses computed there with those obtained in the
continuum limit of lattice gauge theories.
