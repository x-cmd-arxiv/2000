  ApJ",,"10.1086/317060",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the properties of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as functions of the
radial distance from their host galaxy centers. Using a sample of 62 SNe Ia
with reliable luminosity, reddening, and decline rate determinations, we find
no significant radial gradients of SNe Ia peak absolute magnitudes or decline
rates in elliptical+S0 galaxies, suggesting that the diversity of SN properties
is not related to the metallicity of their progenitors. We do find that the
range in brightness and light curve width of supernovae in spiral galaxies
extends to brighter, broader values. These results are interpreted as support
for an age, but not metallicity, related origin of the diversity in SNe Ia. If
confirmed with a larger and more accurate sample of data, the age-luminosity
relation would offer a new and powerful tool to probe the ages and age
gradients of stellar populations in galaxies at redshift as high as $z\sim1-2$.
The absence of significant radial gradients in the peak $\rm (B-V)_0$ and $\rm
(V-I)_0$ colors of SNe Ia supports the redding correction method of Phillips et
al (1999). We find no radial gradient in residuals from the SN Ia
luminosity-width relation, suggesting that the relation is not affected by
properties of the progenitor populations and supporting the reliability of
cosmological results based upon the use of SNe Ia as distance indicators.

carried out on the 6-m telescope for the last years. A magnetic field of about
Be ~ 28 kG has been discovered in the degenerate star WD 1953-011.
  A rotational period of WD 0009+501, 1.83 hours, has been discovered, the
average magnetic field of the star is <Be> = -42.3 +/- 5.4 kG and its
semi-amplitude of the rotational variability is 32.0 +/- 6.8 kG. The variable
magnetic field of the bright normal (non-magnetic) degenerate star 40 Eridani B
was confirmed in January 1999 by Zeeman time-resolved spectroscopy. Both the
Halpha and the Hbeta lines give about the same results, we have selected two
best periods in the magnetic field variability, 2h25m and 5h17m. The
semi-amplitude of the rotational variations B_ max ~ 4000-5000 G and the
average field is about zero +/- 500 G. If the magnetic field of 40 Eridani B is
a central dipole, then the rotational axis inclination to the line of sight is
i ~ 90 DEG, and the magnetic axis inclination to the rotational axis is about
the same, beta ~ 90 DEG. For the first time an ultra-high signal-to-noise
spectrum of the white dwarf has been obtained (S/N > 1000). We have found in
this hydrogen-rich DA white dwarf 40 Eridani B (16500 K) that helium abundance
is low (N(He)/N(H) < 10^{-7}), but the spectrum is rich in ultra-weak
absorption lines of metals in low ionization states. It was proposed that these
lines were produced in both circumstellar and interstellar gas.

  Theory and Observation","Accepted for publication in ApJL (2001, vol 542, L17)",,"10.1086/312915",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the power density spectrum (PDS) of artificial light curves of
observed gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We investigate statistical properties of GRB
light curves by comparing the reported characteristics in the PDSs of the
observed GRBs with those that we model, and discuss implications on
interpretations of the PDS analysis results. Results of PDS analysis of
observed GRBs suggest that the averaged PDS of GRBs follows a power law over
about two decades of frequency with the power law index, -5/3, and the
distribution of individual power follows an exponential distribution. Though an
attempt to identify the most sensitive physical parameter has been made on the
basis of the internal shock model, we demonstrate that conclusions of this kind
of approach should be derived with due care. It is indicative that the physical
information extracted from the slope can be misleading. We show that the
reported slope and the distribution can be reproduced by adjusting the sampling
interval in the time domain for a given decaying timescale of individual pulse
in a specific form of GRB light curves. In particular, given that the temporal
feature is modeled by a two-sided exponential function, the power law behavior
with the index of -5/3 and the exponential distribution of the observed PDS is
recovered at the 64 ms trigger time scale when the decaying timescale of
individual pulse is $\sim 1$ second, provided that the pulse sharply rises.
Another way of using the PDS analysis is an application of the same method to
individual long bursts in order to examine a possible evolution of the decaying
timescale in a single burst.

optical resonators by the mechanical forces associated with single photons
[Hood et al., Science 287, 1447 (2000) and Pinkse et al., Nature 404, 365
(2000)]. Here we analyze the trapping dynamics in these settings, focusing on
two points of interest. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which
light-induced forces in these experiments are distinct from their free-space
counterparts. Secondly, we explore the quantitative features of the resulting
atomic motion and how these dynamics are mapped onto variations of the
intracavity field. Not surprisingly, qualitatively distinct atomic dynamics
arise as the coupling and dissipative rates are varied. For the experiment of
Hood et al., we show that atomic motion is largely conservative and is
predominantly in radial orbits transverse to the cavity axis. A comparison with
the free-space theory demonstrates that the fluctuations of the dipole force
are suppressed by an order of magnitude. This effect is based upon the
Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates of the atom-cavity system and represents
qualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single-photon level. By
contrast, even in a regime of strong coupling in the experiment of Pinkse et
al., there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free-space
theory and the quantum theory, so it is not clear that description of this
experiment as a novel single-quantum trapping effect is necessary. The atomic
motion is strongly diffusive, leading to an average localization time
comparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity and to
a reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the
intracavity photon number.
