These galaxies were selected based on their possession of optical polarized
broad lines. In the 2-10 keV band, their spectra are heavily absorbed, with
2-10 keV absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities ranging from 10^{42} to
10^{43} erg/s. The observed X-ray emission is generally only about one tenth
that predicted based on their known infrared and H_beta luminosities. This
apparent X-ray weakness can be understood if a considerable fraction of the
nuclear activity is completely blocked from view by thick matter along our line
of sight to the nucleus.
  All of these galaxies possess significant soft X-ray emission whose origin
appears to be scattered light from their nuclear emission. Based on this
hypothesis, we estimate a typical scattering efficiency for X-rays to be about
10%. This efficiency is larger than the few % found for ordinary Seyfert 2
galaxies with no report of optical polarized broad lines. A large scattering
efficiency is best explained by an apparent weakness of the hard X-ray
luminosity rather than unusually strong scattered light in the soft band. The
difference of the apparent weakness is probably associated with viewing angle.

opacity is high. Feedback from Lyman-break galaxies in proto-clusters can be
probed by the absorption lines produced in their winds. Strong feedback from

probed with multiple sight-lines and by studying the unsaturated higher-order

into clouds, in order not to over produce the number of absorption lines. These

isotopic purification. $E_o$ can be measured in either field sweep or microwave

the radial heat flows from the colder to the hotter points, in contrast to what
is expected from the Fourier law. Furthermore, a longitudinal component of the

submanifolds of the moduli/parameter space -- the curves of the marginal

`composite' BPS soliton swells in coordinate space as one approaches the CMS
and that, as a bound state of two `primary' solitons, its dynamics in this
region is determined by non-relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Near
the CMS the bound state has a wave function which is highly spread out.
Precisely on the CMS the bound state level reaches the continuum, the composite
state delocalizes in coordinate space, and restructuring of the spectrum can
occur. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior in a two-dimensional N=2
Wess-Zumino model with two chiral fields, and then discuss how it arises in the
context of `composite' dyons near weak coupling CMS curves in N=2
supersymmetric gauge theories. We also consider cases where some states become
massless on the CMS.

$(E,L,\phi)$ where $E$ is a vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$, $L$ is a line
bundle on $X$, and $\phi\colon E_\rho\lra L$ is a non trivial homomorphism.
Here, $E_\rho$ is the vector bundle of rank $\dim V$ associated to $E$ via
$\rho$. If we take, for example, the standard representation of $\GL(r)$ on
$\C^r$ we have to classify triples $(E,L,\phi)$ consisting of $E$ as before and
a non-zero homomorphism $\phi\colon E\lra L$ which includes the so-called

conic bundles of Gomez and Sols. In the present paper, we will formulate a
general semistability concept for the above triples which depends on a rational
parameter $\delta$ and establish the existence of moduli spaces of
$\delta$-(semi)stable triples of fixed topological type. The notion of
semistability mimics the Hilbert-Mumford criterion for $SL(r)$ which is the
main reason that such a general approach becomes feasible. In the known

we show how to recover the ""usual"" semistability concept. This process of
simplification can also be formalized. Altogether, our results provide a

description of reproductive isolation used is based on the classical Dobzhansky

parapatric speciation is modeled as a biased random walk with absorption
performed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants.
If a small number of genetic changes is sufficient for complete reproductive
isolation, mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the
time scale of 10-1000 times the inverse of the mutation rate. Even relatively
weak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time
to speciation. The duration of parapatric speciation is shorter by orders of
magnitude than the waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter
values, the duration of speciation is order one over the mutation rate. In

reaction. We discuss the accuracy of this procedure by analyzing the excitation
function of the fusion cross section and the fusion barrier distribution in the
reactions of $^{154}$Sm target with various projectiles ranging from $^{12}$C
to $^{40}$Ar. It is shown that the approximation gradually looses its accuracy
with increasing charge product of the projectile and target nuclei because of
the effects of finite excitation energy of the target nucleus. The relevance of
such inaccuracy in analyzing the experimental data is also discussed.

We show that in general polarization acquires nontrivial spectral dependence
due to spatial correlations. The spectral dependence is found to be absent only
for a special class of sources where the correlation length scales as the
wavelength of light. We further study the cross correlations between two
spatially distinct points that are generated due to propagation. It is found
that such cross correlation leads to sufficiently strong spectral dependence of
polarization which can be measured experimentally.

consequences of our investigation is that the existence of probability
distributions of the Kolmogorov-type which was supposed by some authors is a
mathematical assumption which may not be supported by actual physical quantum
processes. In fact, frequencies for hidden variables for quantum particles and
measurement devices may fluctuate from run to run of an experiment. These
fluctuations of frequencies for micro-parameters need not contradict to the
stabilization of frequencies for physical observables. If, nevertheless,
micro-parameters are also statistically stable, then violations of Bell's
inequality and its generalizations may be a consequence of dependence of
collectives corresponding to two different measurement devices. Such a
dependence implies the violation of the factorization rule for the simultaneous
probability distribution. Formally this rule coincides with the well known BCHS
locality condition (or outcome independence condition). However, the frequency
approach implies totally different interpretation of dependence. It is not
dependence of events, but it is dependence of collectives. Such a dependence
may be induced by the same preparation procedure.

"quant-ph/0006017","Andrei Khrennikov","Andrei Khrennikov","Kolmogorov and von Mises viewpoints to the Greenburger-Horne-Zeilinger
  paradox",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present comparative probabilistic analysis of the
Greenburger-Horne-Zeilinger paradox in the frameworks of Kolmogorov's
(measure-theoretical) and von Mises' (frequency) models of the probability
theory. This analysis demonstrated that the GHZ paradox is merely a consequence
of the use of Kolmogorov's probabilistic model. By using von Mises' frequency
approach we escape the contradiction between the local realism and quantum
formalism. The frequency approach implies automatically contextual
interpretation of quantum formalism: different collectives induce different
probability distributions. On the other hand, the formal use of Kolmogorov's
model implies the identification of such distributions with one abstract
Kolmogorov measure. In the measure-theoretical approach we can escape the
paradox, if we do not suppose that probability distributions corresponding to
different settings of measurement devices are equivalent. We discuss the
connection between equivalence/singularity dichotomy in measure theory and the
existence of compatible and noncompatible observables.

two steps i.e. by preparing an input state and performing a measurement is
discussed. The analysis reveals that the duration of state preparation and
measurement is proportional to N while the energy consumption grows like log N.
These results suggest the existence of Heisenberg-type relation putting limits
on the efficiency of a quantum computer in terms of a total computation time, a
total energy consumption and a classical complexity of the problem.
