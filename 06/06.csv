claim that dwarf galaxies have dark matter halos with constant density cores.
Consequently, numerous alternative dark matter candidates have recently been
proposed. In this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for the
incongruity between dwarf galaxies and the CDM model. To this end, we analyze
the rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by Swaters (1999).
Taking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, we
fit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different
cusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. Uncertainties
in the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the
halo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. Consequently,
the rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark
halos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. We show that the dwarf
galaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a LCDM
cosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter
is cold and collisionless. However, the data is also consistent with any
alternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central
cusps less steep than r^{-1.5}. In fact, we argue that based on existing
rotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmological
parameters and/or the nature of the dark matter.

molecules, in non-LTE. This method is based on a superlevel formalism coupled
with rate operator splitting. Superlevels consist of many individual levels
that are assumed to be in LTE relative to each other. The usage of superlevels
reduces the dimensionality of the rate equations dramatically and, thereby,
makes the problem computationally more easily treatable. Our superlevel
formalism retains maximum accuracy by using direct opacity sampling (dOS) when
calculating the radiative transitions and the opacities. We developed this
method in order to treat molecules in cool dwarf model calculations in non-LTE.
Cool dwarfs have low electron densities and a radiation field that is far from
a black body radiation field, both properties may invalidate the conditions for
the common LTE approximation. Therefore, the most important opacity sources,
the molecules, need to be treated in non-LTE. As a case study we applied our
method to carbon monoxide. We find that our method gives accurate results since
the conditions for the superlevel method are very well met for molecules. Due
to very high collisional cross sections with hydrogen, and the high densities
of H_2 the population of CO itself shows no significant deviation from LTE.

number and others. This allows to define thermo-statistics {\em without the use
of the thermodynamic limit}, to apply it to ``Small'' systems as well and to
define phase transitions unambiguously also there. ``Small'' systems are
systems where the linear dimension is of the characteristic range of the
interaction between the particles. Also astrophysical systems are ``Small'' in
this sense. Boltzmann defines the entropy as the logarithm of the area
$W(E,N)=e^{S(E,N)}$ of the surface in the mechanical N-body phase space at

determinant $D(E,N)=\partial^2S/\partial E^2*\partial^2S/\partial
N^2-(\partial^2S/\partial E\partial N)^2$ allows the classification of phase
transitions {\em without taking the thermodynamic limit}. The topology gives
further a simple and transparent definition of the {\em order parameter.}
Attention: Boltzmann's entropy S(E) as defined here is different from the

linguistics problems has produced a large supply of trainable natural language
processing systems. Most problems of interest have an array of off-the-shelf
products or downloadable code implementing solutions using various techniques.
Where these solutions are developed independently, it is observed that their
errors tend to be independently distributed. This thesis is concerned with
approaches for capitalizing on this situation in a sample problem domain, Penn
Treebank-style parsing.
  The machine learning community provides techniques for combining outputs of
classifiers, but parser output is more structured and interdependent than
classifications. To address this discrepancy, two novel strategies for
combining parsers are used: learning to control a switch between parsers and
constructing a hybrid parse from multiple parsers' outputs.
  Off-the-shelf parsers are not developed with an intention to perform well in
a collaborative ensemble. Two techniques are presented for producing an
ensemble of parsers that collaborate. All of the ensemble members are created
using the same underlying parser induction algorithm, and the method for
producing complementary parsers is only loosely constrained by that chosen
algorithm.

on the range of possibilities allowed for the approximate theory which are not
derivable from the latter - an example being the symmetry restrictions on the
wave function for a pair of electrons. We argue that the choice of vacuum state
at low energies could be such a `relic' arising from combining the principles
of quantum theory and general relativity, and demonstrate this result in a
simple toy model. Our analysis suggests that the wave function of the universe,
when it describes the large volume limit of the universe, dynamically selects a
vacuum state for matter fields - which in turn defines the concept of particle

the advantage of eliminating any ultraviolet divergence in the vacuum energy

an illustration of the procedure, we consider the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in

complementary to what one obtains from $b \to s+ \gamma$ bounds within the AMSB

unification imply the existence of extra matter multiplets and that several

simultaneous solutions to all of them. It is surprising and encouraging that
extending the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by a simple U(1) factor
solves its major drawbacks with respect to the non-supersymmetric Standard

dependence. The more complex flow has at least one additional characteristic
frequency -- the horizontal frequency of the cold, downward- and the warm,
upward-flowing plumes. Observables of this latter flow have a broadband
frequency distribution. The two flow morphologies, at the same Rayleigh number,
have different rates of entropy production and different Lyapunov exponents.
The simpler ""harmonic"" flow transports more heat (produces entropy at a greater
rate), whereas the more complex ""chaotic"" flow has a larger maximum Lyapunov
exponent (corresponding to a larger rate of phase-space information loss). A
linear combination of these two rates is invariant for the two flow
morphologies over the entire range of Rayleigh numbers for which the flows
coexist, suggesting a relation between the two rates near the onset of
convective turbulence.

interactions. The nuclear weak charge and current operators have vector and
axial-vector components, that include one- and many-body terms. All possible
multipole transitions connecting any of the p 3He S- and P-wave channels to the
4He bound state are considered. The S-factor at a p 3He center-of-mass energy
of 10 keV, close to the Gamow-peak energy, is predicted to be 10.1 10^{-20} keV
b with the AV18/UIX Hamiltonian, a factor of about 4.5 larger than the value
adopted in the standard solar model. The P-wave transitions are found to be
important, contributing about 40 % of the calculated S-factor. The energy
dependence is rather weak: the AV18/UIX zero-energy S-factor is 9.64 10^{-20}
keV b, only 5 % smaller than the 10 keV result quoted above. The model
dependence is also found to be weak: the zero-energy S-factor is calculated to
be 10.2 10^{-20} keV b with the older AV14/UVIII model, only 6 % larger than
the AV18/UIX result. Our best estimate for the S-factor at 10 keV is therefore
(10.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-20} keV b, when the theoretical uncertainty due to the
model dependence is included. This value for the calculated S-factor is not as
large as determined in fits to the Super-Kamiokande data in which the hep flux
normalization is free. However, the precise calculation of the S-factor and the
consequent absolute prediction for the hep neutrino flux will allow much
greater discrimination among proposed solar neutrino oscillation solutions.

out an agreement in structure between the equation for rays in geometrical
optics and the geodesic equation of general relativity. From their comparison
we learn that the path of rays should be given by the relation
$ds^2=n^2(r)dr^2+r^2d\theta^2$, not by $ds^2=dr^2+r^2d\theta^2$, in a medium
with spherical symmetry of refractive index $n(r)$. The development of an
optical analogy suggests introducing $n^2(r)$ in place of $g_{rr}$ as an
optical version of the Schwarzschild metric. In form and content, $n^2(r)$ is
different from $g_{rr}$. The optical point of view replaces the
general-relativity explanations in terms of time and gravitation.

motion leads to a computationally quick approximation for the invariant spin

nature of these equations can lead to simplified computations of particle
transport through an optical device when a suitable computational method is
used. Many ingenious microscopic and lithographic devices were found by H. Rose

accelerator physics the eikonal method has never become popular. Here I will
therefore generalize the eikonal method and derive it from a Hamiltonian quite
familiar to the accelerator physics community. With the event of high energy
polarized electron beams and plans for high energy proton beams, nonlinear

given Kramers--Kronig consistent permittivities is developed. It is based on a
source-quantity representation of the electromagnetic field, in which the
electromagnetic-field operators are expressed in terms of a continuous set of
fundamental bosonic fields via the Green tensor of the classical problem.
Introducing scalar and vector potentials, the formalism is extended in order to
include in the theory the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field
with additional atoms. Both the minimal-coupling scheme and the
multipolar-coupling scheme are considered. The theory replaces the standard
concept of mode decomposition which fails for complex permittivities. It
enables us to treat the effects of dispersion and absorption in a consistent
way and to give a unified approach to the atom-field interaction, without any
restriction to a particular interaction regime in a particular frequency range.
All relevant information about the dielectric bodies such as form and intrinsic
dispersion and absorption is contained in the Green tensor. The application of
the theory to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom in the presence of
dispersing and absorbing bodies is addressed.
