the type IIn SN 1998S covering the period between 11 and 146 days after
discovery. The infrared data constitute the first ever infrared light curves of
a type IIn supernova. We use blackbody and spline fits to the photometry to
examine the luminosity evolution. During the first 2--3 months, the luminosity
is dominated by the release of shock-deposited energy in the ejecta. After
$\sim$100 days the luminosity is powered mostly by the deposition of
radioactive decay energy from 0.15$\pm$0.05 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni which was
produced in the explosion. We also report the discovery of an astonishingly
high infrared (IR) excess, $K-L'=2.5$, that was present at day 130. We
interpret this as being due to thermal emission from dust grains in the
vicinity of the supernova. We argue that to produce such a high IR luminosity
so soon after the explosion, the dust must be {\it pre-existing} and so is
located in the circumstellar medium of the progenitor. The dust could be heated
either by the UV/optical flash (IR echo) or by the X-rays from the interaction
of the ejecta with the circumstellar material

(Drinkwater et al. 1997) to constrain the cosmic evolution in the co-moving
space density of radio sources in the top decade of the flat-spectrum radio
luminosity function (RLF). A consistent picture for the high-redshift evolution
is achieved using both simple parametric models, which are the first to allow
for distributions in both radio luminosity and spectral index, and variants of
the V / V_max test, some of which incorporate the effects of radio spectral
curvature. For the most luminous flat-spectrum objects, the PHJFS sample is
extremely similar to that used by Shaver et al. (1996, 1998) to argue for an
abrupt `redshift cut-off': a decrease by a factor ~30 in space density between
a peak redshift z~2.5 and z~5. Our analysis finds that the observable co-moving
volume is too small to make definitive statements about any redshift cut-off
for the most luminous flat-spectrum sources, although both constant-space
density (no cut-off) models and models with cut-offs as abrupt as those
envisaged by Shaver et al. are outside the 90% confidence region. The inference
that the decline in space density is most likely to be gradual, by a factor ~4
between z~2.5 and z~5, is in accordance with previous work on the RLF by Dunlop
& Peacock (1990), but different to the abrupt decline favoured by studies of
optically-selected quasars. Dust obscuration provides one explanation for this
difference. We show that a significant fraction of the most radio-luminous
flat-spectrum objects are Giga-Hertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) rather than
Doppler-Boosted (DB) sources, complicating any interpretation of the redshift
cut-off.

Big Bang at which normal star formation started in an individual protogalactic

galaxy interactions, using a merging galaxy sequence comprising both pre- and
post-mergers. Data for this study come from the literature but supplemented by
new radio observations presented here. Firstly, we confirm that the
star-formation efficiency (SFE) increases close to nuclear coalescence. At
post-merger stages there is evidence that the SFE declines to values typical of
ellipticals. This trend can be attributed to M(H_2) depletion due to
interaction induced star-formation. However, there is significant scatter,
likely to arise from differences in the interaction details of individual
systems. Secondly, we find that the central molecular hydrogen surface density,
increases close to the final stages of the merging of the two nuclei. Such a
trend is also predicted by numerical simulations. Furthermore, there is
evidence for a decreasing fraction of cold gas mass from early interacting
systems to merger remnants, attributed to gas conversion into other forms. The
evolution of the total-radio to blue-band luminosity ratio, reflecting the
disk+nucleus star-formation activity, is also investigated. Although this ratio
is on average higher than that of isolated spirals, we find a marginal increase
along the merging sequence, attributed to the relative insensitivity of disk
star-formation to interactions. However, a similar result is also obtained for
the nuclear radio emission, although galaxy interactions are believed to
significantly affect the activity in the central galaxy regions. Finally, we
find that the FIR--radio flux ratio distribution of interacting galaxies is
consistent with star-formation being the main energising source.

The time scales of the sudden change and convection are compared and their
similar order of magnitude is interpreted to be a possible hint for strong
coupling between pulsation and convection. The periods of the biperiodic
low-amplitude light curve and their ratios suggest a pulsation in the first and
third overtone modes. An alternative explanation of the observed behaviour
could be a period halving due to the presence of weak chaos.

three stars with significant amplitude modulations (RY Leo, RX UMa and RY UMa).
A simple geometric model of a rotationally induced amplitude modulation in RY
UMa is outlined assuming low-order nonradial oscillation, while the observed
behaviour of RX UMa and RY Leo is explained as a beating of two closely
separated modes of pulsation. This phenomenon is detected unambiguously in V
CVn, too. The period ratios found in these stars (1.03-1.10) suggest either
high-order overtone or radial+non-radial oscillation.

scheme is used, allowing an explicit weak-field limit with all fields expanded.
Exact mass centers are defined and their exact equations of motion are derived.
The PN expansion of these equations is obtained: the zero-order equations are
those of Newtonian gravity (NG), and the equations for the first-order (PN)
corrections depend linearly on the PN fields. For PN corrections to the motion
of the mass centers, especially in the solar system, one may assume ""
very-well-separated "" rigidly moving bodies with spherical self-fields of the
zero-order approximation. The PN corrections reduce then to a time integration

K), we find that the pseudogap behavior, {\em i.e.}, the reductions of 1/T_{1}T
and K above T_{c} from the values expected from the normal state at high T, is
strongly field dependent and follows a scaling relation. We show that this
scaling is consistent with the effects of the Cooper pair density fluctuations.
The present finding contrasts sharply with the pseudogap property reported
previously in the underdoped regime where no field effect was seen up to 23.2
T. The implications are discussed.

interferometry seems to be the first indication of a VEP. However, such a view
would seem immediately challenged by the atomic interferometry results. The
latter experiments see no indications of VEP, in apparent contradiction to the
neutron interferometry results. Here we present arguments that support the view
that these, and related torsion pendulum experiments, probe different aspects
of gravity; and that current experimental techniques, when coupled to the
solar-neutrino data, may be able to explore quantum mechanically induced
violations of the equivalence principle. We predict quantum violation of the

Similarly, a new measurement of the parity-violating gamma-ray asymmetry in
polarized neutron capture on the proton is being developed with a ten-fold
improvement over previous measurements. These experiments are intended to
provide stringent constraints on the set of seven effective weak meson-nucleon
coupling constants. Time-reversal-invariance non-conservation has now been
unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement at CPLEAR. Tests may also be
made of time-reversal-invariance non-conservation in systems other than the
kaon system. There exist two classes of time-reversal invariance breaking
interactions: P-odd/T-odd and P-even/T-odd interactions. Constraints on the
first ones stem from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron,
while constraints on the second ones stem from the same and measurements of
charge symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering and from $K$
semi-leptonic decays. A series of precision experiments, either ongoing or
being prepared, will determine the neutral weak current of the proton by
measuring the parity-violating normalized asymmetry in electron-proton elastic
scattering. A direct comparison between the electromagnetic and neutral weak
ground state currents of the nucleon will allow a delineation of the
contributions to these currents of the various quark flavours, including quarks
which belong exclusively to the nucleon sea. An extension of these precision
experiments to very low momentum transfer would permit stringent limits to be

with the simplest understanding of coherence this is the best one can hope for

Random matrix theory predicts the absence of such correlations in chaotic
systems whereas in the stadium billiard, a paradigm of chaos, strong
correlations were observed. Here, we develop further the theoretical basis of

hbar-dependence, and demonstrate the agreement between this measure and a

provides a new way of exploring phase space localization in quantized

ergodicity due to quantum effects for typical observables. This paper relies on
two well known paradigms of quantum chaos, the bakers map and the standard map,
to study correlations in simple, yet chaotic, dynamical systems. The behaviors
are dominated by the presence of several classical structures. These primarily
include short periodic orbits and their homoclinic excursions. The dependences
of the correlations deriving from perturbations allow for eigenfunction
features violating ergodicity to be selectively highlighted. A semiclassical
theory based on periodic orbit sums leads to certain classical correlations
that are super-exponentially cut off beyond a logarithmic time scale. The
theory is seen to be quite successful in reproducing many of the quantum
localization features.

been studied using 1-D particle-in-cell simulation. In contrast to earlier work
for infinitely massive ion plasmas it has been found that the oscillations
phase mix away at any amplitude and that the rate at which phase mixing occurs,
depends on the mass ratio ($\Delta = m_{-}/m_{+}$) and the amplitude. A
perturbation theoretic calculation carried upto third order predicts that the
normalized phase mixing time $\omega_{p-} t_{mix}$ depends on the amplitude $A$
and the mass ratio $\Delta$ as $\sim [(A^{2}/24)(\Delta/\sqrt{1 +
\Delta})]^{-1/3}$. We have confirmed this scaling in our simulations and
conclude that stable non-linear oscillations which never phase mix, exist only
for the ideal case with $\Delta = 0.0$ and $A < 0.5$. These cold plasma results
may have direct relevance to recent experiments on superintense laser beam
plasma interactions with applications to particle acceleration, fast ignitor
concept etc.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is a wavenumber triad ({\bf k,p,q})
satisfying ${\bf k+p+q=0}$. The expression for the combined energy transfer
from two of these wavenumbers to the third wavenumber is known. In this paper
we introduce the idea of an effective energy transfer between a pair of modes
through the mediation of the third mode and then find an expression for it. In
fluid turbulence, energy transfer takes place between a pair of velocity modes,
whereas in MHD turbulence energy transfer takes places between (1) a pair of
velocity modes, (2) a pair of magnetic modes, and (3) between a velocity and a
magnetic mode in a triad. In this paper we have obtained the expression for
each of these transfers. We also show how the effective mode-to-mode energy
transfer rate can be utilised to study energy cascades and shell-to-shell
energy transfer rates.

antibodies of an immune system) and anti-idiotypes are represented by
complementary bitstrings of a given length d allowing for a number of
mismatches (matching rules). In this model, the vertices of the hypercube in
dimension d represent the potential repertoire of idiotypes. A random set of
(with probability p) occupied vertices corresponds to the expressed repertoire
of idiotypes at a given moment. Vertices of this set linked by the above
matching rules build random clusters. We give a structural and statistical
characterisation of these clusters - or in other words - of the architecture of
the idiotypic network. Increasing the probability p one finds at a critical p a
percolation transition where for the first time a large connected graph occures
with probability one. Increasing p further, there is a second transition above
which the repertoire is complete in the sense that any newly introduced
idiotype finds a complementary anti-idiotype. We introduce structural
characteristics such as the mass distributions and the fragmentation rate for
random clusters, and determine the scaling behaviour of the cluster size
distribution near the percolation transition, including finite size
corrections. We find that slightly above the percolation transition the large
connected cluster (the central part of the idiotypic network) consists
typically of one highly connected part and a number of weakly connected
constituents and coexists with a number of small, isolated clusters. This is in
accordance with the picture of a central and a peripheral part of the idiotypic
network and gives some support to idealized architectures of the central part
used in recent dynamical mean field models.

is the success probability of the given algorithm. Thus the choice of phases
depends nontrivially and nonlinearly on the success probability. Utilizing this
