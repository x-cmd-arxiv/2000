measured by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) air Cerenkov telescopes
extends beyond 16 TeV and constitutes the most energetic photons observed from
an extragalactic object. A fraction of the emitted spectrum is possibly
absorbed in interactions with low energy photons of the diffuse extragalactic
infrared radiation, which in turn offers the unique possibility to measure the
diffuse infrared radiation density by TeV spectroscopy. The upper limit on the
density of the extragalactic infrared radiation derived from the TeV
observations imposes constraints on models of galaxy formation and stellar
evolution. One of the recently published ideas to overcome severe absorption of
TeV photons is based upon the assumption that sources like Mrk 501 could
produce Bose-Einstein condensates of coherent photons. The condensates would
have a higher survival probability during the transport in the diffuse
radiation field and could mimic TeV air shower events. The powerful
stereoscopic technique of the HEGRA air Cerenkov telescopes allows to test this
hypothesis by reconstructing the penetration depths of TeV air shower events:
Air showers initiated by Bose-Einstein condensates are expected to reach the
maximum of the shower development in the atmosphere earlier than single photon
events. By comparing the energy-dependent penetration depths of TeV photons
from Mrk 501 with those from the TeV standard-candle Crab Nebula and simulated
air shower events, we can reject the hypothesis that TeV photons from Mrk 501
are pure Bose-Einstein condensates.

expansion of magnetized material in simulated observations of the jet. From
comparison of measured wavelengths and wave speeds with the predictions from

primary cause for mass entrainment in these simulations, and that the expansion
reduces the rate of mass entrainment. This reduced rate can be observed as a
somewhat greater distance between the two transition points separating the

assume only that the measurements are independent and free of systematic
errors. This estimate is arguably the best summary of current knowledge because
it uses all available data and, unlike other estimates, makes no assumption
about the distribution of measurement errors. The 95% range of purely

leads us to analyze the range of possible systematic errors in the median,

the statistical errors. A Bayesian median statistics treatment of high-redshift

$r$-modes are strongly affected by mode coupling with the crustal torsional

eigenfrequency as functions of the angular rotation velocity $\Omega$. This
indicates that the extrapolation formula, which is obtained in the limit of

evolution of cluster galaxies. We calculate the evolution of clusters by
combining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of Cole et al. with a
simple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. We focus on the
cluster X-ray luminosity function and on the relation between X-ray temperature
and luminosity. We show that cooling alone is not enough to account for the
flatness of the observed T-L relation or for the lack of strong redshift
evolution in the observed X-ray luminosity function. Gas heating, on the other
hand, can solve these two problems: in the \Lambda-CDM cosmology, our model
reproduces fairly well the T-L relation and the X-ray luminosity function.
Furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out to
z=0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. A successful model requires
an energy input of 1--2 x 10^49 ergs per solar mass of stars formed. This is
comparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with the
formation of the cluster galaxies. Thus, unless the transfer of supernovae
energy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient,
additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from AGN winds are
required. However, the amplification of an initial energy input by the response
of the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energy
requirements. Our model makes definite predictions for the X-ray properties of
groups and clusters at high redshift which may soon be tested with data from
the Chandra and Newton satellites.

impact on the transfer of stellar radiation, and affects the projection of each
physical (and kinematic) quantity. In a previous paper, we have investigated
the effects of a diffusely distributed dust component on the observed
kinematics of spherical galaxies. In this paper we investigate the effect of
not taking dust into account in dynamical modelling procedures. We use a set of
semi-analytical dusty galaxy models to create synthetic LOSVD data sets, which
we then model as if no dust were present.
  We find some considerable differences between the best-fitting models and the
input models, and we find that these differences are dependent on the orbital
structure of the input galaxy. For radial and isotropic models on the one hand,
we find that the dynamical mass of the models decreases nearly linearly with
optical depth, with an amount of 5 per cent per optical depth unit, whereas
their orbital structure is hardly affected. For tangential models on the other
hand, the dynamical mass decrease is smaller, but their orbital structure is
affected: their distribution functions appears less tangentially anisotropic.
For all models the mass-to-light ratio will be underestimated, by a factor of
around 20 per cent per optical depth unit.

extinction on the LOSVDs, as obtained in paper I, and conclude that the

chains is studied using both analytical techniques and simulation. The system
is found to have a crossover transition at some finite temperature, from a type
of short range order to a fundamentally different sort of short range order. In
the high temperature regime, the 2-point correlation functions of the object
are identical to worm-like chains, while in the low temperature regime they are
different due to a twist structure. The crossover happens when the persistence
length of individual strands becomes comparable to the thickness of the ribbon.
In the low temperature regime, the ribbon is observed to have a novel
``kink-rod'' structure with a mutual exclusion of twist and bend in contrast to
smooth worm-like chain behaviour. This is due to its anisotropic rigidity and
corresponds to an {\it infinitely} strong twist-bend coupling. The
double-stranded polymer is also studied in a confined geometry. It is shown
that when the polymer is restricted in a particular direction to a size less
than the bare persistence length of the individual strands, it develops zigzag
conformations which are indicated by an oscillatory tangent-tangent correlation
function in the direction of confinement. Increasing the separation of the
confining plates leads to a crossover to the free behaviour, which takes place
at separations close to the bare persistence length. These results are expected
to be relevant for experiments which involve complexation of two or more stiff
or semiflexible polymers.

above the 105 K structural phase transition of SrTiO$_3$ have been studied in
five different single crystals by means of high resolution triple-crystal
diffractometry using 100-120 keV synchrotron radiation. Depth-dependent
impedance measurements indicate that the presence of oxygen vacancies is not
responsible for the two-length scale phenomenon. It is found that the sharp
component occurs only in surface near regions of highly perfect single crystals
and is coupled to an exponential inrease of the crystallographic quantities.
The second length scale is absent at a surface where the strain fields are able
to relax by a macroscopic bending of the lattice planes. The sharp component is
also strongly suppressed in crystals of relatively large mosaicity. The
combination of long range strain fields in highly perfect samples and the
vicinity of the surface seem to be necessary conditions for the observation of
the sharp component. The critical exponents for the second length scale are in
satisfying agreement with scaling laws if the intensity of the critical
scattering is assumed to be proportional to the square of the Lorentzian
susceptibility and not, as usual in the current convention, to a
Lorentzian-squared susceptibility. The critical exponents of the broad

reasonable choices of surface tension and correlation length, as obtained from
the lattice QCD calculations, we show that the amount of phase mixing at the

system cools below the critical temperature, the transition proceeds through
the nucleation of critical-size hadron bubbles from a metastable quark-gluon
phase (QGP), within an inhomogeneous background populated by an equilibrium
distribution of subcritical hadron bubbles. The inhomogeneity of the medium
results in a substantial reduction of the nucleation barrier for critical

Segal-Bargmann transform, and the Taylor expansion. The results are related to
geometric quantization, to stochastic analysis, and to the quantization of
1+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.

B 70, 415-417 (2000)",,"10.1007/s003400050067",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper, we present a scheme for quantum key distribution, in which
different-frequency photons are used to encode the key. Thses
different-frequency photons are produced by an acoustic-optical modulator and
two kinds of narrow filters . This scheme may be implementable in practice.

transform and requires no initialization of an ancillary register. The
algorithm recovers the initial state of an ancillary register regardless of
whether its state is pure or mixed. Thus we can use any qubits as an ancillary
register even though they are entangled with others and are occupied by other
computational process. We also show that our algorithm is optimal in the sense
of the number of function evaluations.

  dimensional Hilbert spaces",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  Universal two-particle entanglement processes are analyzed in arbitrary
dimensional Hilbert spaces. On the basis of this analysis the class of possible
optimal universal entanglement processes is determined whose resulting output
states do not contain any separable states. It is shown that these processes
form a one-parameter family. For all Hilbert space dimensions larger than two
the resulting optimally entangled output states are mixtures of anti-symmetric
states which are freely entangled and which also preserve information about
input states. Within this one-parameter family there is only one process by
which all information about any input state is destroyed completely.

gravitational cavity. It is demonstrated that the external driving field
influences the revival time significantly. Analytical expressions are presented
which are based on second order perturbation theory and semiclassical secular
theory. These analytical results explain the dependence of the revival time on
the characteristic parameters of the problem quantitatively in a simple way.
They are in excellent agreement with numerical results.

exchange interactions in an ensemble of atoms (J.D. Franson and T.B. Pitman,
Phys. Rev. A 60, 917 (1999) and J.D. Franson et al., (quant-ph/9912121)) is
discussed using an S-matix approach. It is shown that if the nonlinear response
of the atoms is negligible and no additional atom-atom interactions are
present, exchange interactions cannot produce entanglement between photons
states in a process that returns the atoms to their initial state. Entanglement
generation requires the presence of a nonlinear atomic response or atom-atom
interactions.
