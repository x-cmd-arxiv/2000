the observed flux of cosmic rays at the highest energies. However, recent
studies of GRBs indicate that their redshift distribution likely follows that
of the average star formation rate and that GRBs were more numerous at high
redshifts. As a consequence, we show that photomeson production energy losses
suffered by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays coming from GRBs would produce too
sharp a spectral high energy cutoff to be consistent with the air shower data.
Furthermore, we show that cosmological GRBs fail to supply the energy input
required to account for the cosmic ray flux above 10 EeV by a factor of
100-1000.

magnetised star surrounded by a thin Keplerian diamagnetic disc with an inner
edge that corotates with the star. We suppose the stellar field is a dipole
with an axis that is slightly misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. The
rotation axes of the disc material orbiting at large distances from the star
and that of the star are supposed to coincide. The misalignment of the magnetic
and rotation axes results in the magnetic pressure not being the same on the
upper and lower surfaces of the disc. The resultant net vertical force produces
a warp which appears stationary in a frame corotating with the star. We find
that, if viscosity is large enough (alpha on the order of 0.01-0.1) to damp
bending waves as they propagate away, a smoothly varying warp of the inner
region of the disc is produced. The amplitude of the warp can easily be on the
order of ten percent of the disc inner radius for reasonably small misalignment
angles (less than 30 degrees). Viscous damping also introduces a phase shift
between the warp and the forcing torque, which results in the locations of
maximum elevation above the disc forming a trailing spiral pattern. We apply
these results to recent observations of AA Tau, and show that the variability
of its light curve, which occurs with a period comparable to the expected
stellar rotation period, could be due to obscuration produced by a warp
configuration of the type we obtain.

applicable to electron-positron plasmas. The methods of derivation can be
extended in an obvious manner to several charged species. Generalized
Grad-Shafranov equations, describing the equilibrium magnetic field, are
derived. Flux function equations and Bernoulli relations for each species,
together with Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential, complete the

straightforward to solve numerically. The two-fluid system, unlike the MHD

that there exists a class of incompressible MHD equilibria with magnetic

in which the flow speed is everywhere equal to the local Alfven speed, is
compatible with virtually any azimuthally symmetric magnetic configuration.

discriminated from the noisy background by searching for sets of connected
pixels having brightnesses above a given threshold and then they are classified
as stars or as galaxies through diagnostic diagrams having variables choosen
accordingly to the astronomer's taste and experience. In the extraction step,
assuming that images are well sampled, NExt requires only the simplest a priori
definition of ""what an object is"" (id est, it keeps all structures composed by
more than one pixels) and performs the detection via an unsupervised NN
approaching detection as a clustering problem which has been thoroughly studied
in the artificial intelligence literature. In order to obtain an objective and
reliable classification, instead of using an arbitrarily defined set of
features, we use a NN to select the most significant features among the large
number of measured ones, and then we use their selected features to perform the
classification task. In order to optimise the performances of the system we
implemented and tested several different models of NN. The comparison of the
NExt performances with those of the best detection and classification package
known to the authors (SExtractor) shows that NExt is at least as effective as
the best traditional packages.

cores of galaxy clusters from the strong lensing, the X-ray measurements and
the universal density profile (NFW). Special attention is paid to the questions
(1)whether the previously claimed mass discrepancy between the strong lensing
and X-ray measurements is associated with the presence of cooling/non-cooling
flows, (2)whether the cusped NFW density model can provide a consistent cluster
mass with the strong lensing result and (3)whether a non-zero cosmological
constant can be of any help to reducing the strong lensing - X-ray mass ratios.
We analyse a sample of 26 arc-like images among 21 clusters. The X-ray and NFW
cluster masses are obtained by assuming that the intracluster gas is isothermal
and in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential of
the clusters. A statistical comparison of these three mass estimates reveals
that the mass discrepancies for all the events are well within a factor of 2.
We confirm the result of Allen that the larger mass discrepancy is only
detected in the intermediate cooling, especially non-cooling flow clusters,
thus attributing the mass discrepancy to the local dynamical activities in the
central regions. We show that the NFW profile yields a consistent cluster mass
with the conventional X-ray measurement, and any difference between these two
models must occur at even smaller radii (e.g. within the arc-like images) or at
large radii. Finally, a non-zero cosmological constant is able to moderately
reduce the mass ratios of m_lens to m_xray.

been challenged in recent years by the discoveries of the soft cores for a
broad range of masses from dwarf galaxies to clusters of galaxies. It is thus
desirable that a new, analytic model would instead become available for
virialized dark halos. One promising candidate is probably the empirical
density profile proposed by Burkert, which resembles an isothermal profile with
a constant core in the inner region and matches the NFW profile at large radii.
Meanwhile, such a revised dark halo (RDH) profile has turned out a great
success on galactic scales. This stimulates us to apply the RDH profile to more
massive systems like clusters of galaxies. In this paper we have made an
attempt to derive the radial density profile of intracluster gas from the RDH
profile, and compare it with those revealed by X-ray observations and inferred
from the NFW profile. It is shown that the RDH predicted gas density can be
well represented by the conventional beta model with a typical beta parameter
of 0.7-0.9. Fitting the theoretically predicted X-ray surface brightness
profile to an ensemble of 45 X-ray clusters, we find that the RDH and NFW
profiles become to be almost indistinguishable. Yet, the RDH profile allows us
to work out straightforwardly the central dark matter density of clusters from
X-ray measurements. Using the 45 clusters, we find that the central densities
of clusters have an average value of ~0.01 solar mass pc^{-3}, in agreement
with the result estimated on galactic scales, which reinforces the claim for
the presence of the soft halo cores over the entire mass range.

brightness profiles of clusters, and derive analytically the gas density and
total masses of clusters under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis. It is
shown that the employment of the double beta model instead of the conventional
single beta model can significantly improve the goodness of fit to the observed
X-ray surface brightness profiles of clusters, which will in turn lead to a
better determination of the gas and total mass distributions in clusters. In
particular, the observationally fitted beta parameter for the extended
component in a double beta model may become larger. This opens a new
possibility of resolving the long-standing beta discrepancy for clusters. Using
an ensemble of 33 ROSAT PSPC observed clusters drawn from the Mohr, Mathiesen &
Evrard (1999) sample, we find that the asymptotic value of beta_{fit} is
(0.83+-0.33) at large radii, consistent with both the average spectroscopic
parameter beta_{spec}=(0.78+-0.37) and the result given by numerical
simulations.

which are centred around the \v{C}erenkov image characteristics. However there
are not many techniques available for improving the signal to noise ratio of
the data from wavefront sampling observations. One such possible technique is
to use the \v{C}erenkov photon arrival times and identify the species dependent
characteristics in them. Here we carry out systematic monte carlo simulation
studies of the timing information of \v{C}erenkov photons at the observation
level. We have parameterized the shape of the \v{C}erenkov shower front as well
as the pulse shapes in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. We
demonstrate the sensitivity of the curvature of the shower front, pulse shape
parameters as well as the photon arrival time jitter to primary species and
show their efficiency in improving the signal to noise ratio. The effect of
limiting the \v{C}erenkov telescope opening angle by using a circular focal
point mask, onthe efficacy of the parameters has also been studied for each of
the parameters. Radius of the shower front, pulse decay time and photon arrival
time jitter have been found to be the most promising parameters which could be
used to discriminate $\gamma -$ray events from the background. We also find
that the efficiency of the first two parameters increases with zenith angle and
efficiency of pulse decay time decreases with increasing altitude of
observation.

affect the central density profile. Cross-sections an order of magnitude larger
produce sufficient relaxation for rich clusters to develop core radii in the
range 100-200 $h^{-1}$kpc. The structural evolution of halos is a competition
between collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions and
violent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by which
clusters grow. Although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size,
we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarf
galaxies. We find that collision cross-sections sufficiently large to
significantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores which are
too large and/or too round to be consistent with observation. Thus the simplest
model for self-interacting dark matter is unable to improve fits to published
dwarf galaxy rotation curves without violating other observational constraints.

superconducting phase coherence go hand-in-hand. As the temperature is lowered,
both the energy gap and phase coherence appear at the transition temperature
T_c. In contrast, in underdoped high-T_c superconductors (HTSCs), a pseudogap
appears at a much higher temperature T^*, smoothly evolving into the
superconducting gap at T_c. Phase coherence on the other hand is only
established at T_c, signaled by the appearance of a sharp quasiparticle (QP)
peak in the excitation spectrum. Another important difference between the two
types of superconductors is in the ratio of 2\Delta / T_c=R. In BCS theory,
R~3.5, is constant. In the HTSCs this ratio varies widely, continuing to
increase in the underdoped region, where the gap increases while T_c decreases.
Here we report that in HTSCs it is the ratio z_A\Delta_m/T_c which is
approximately constant, where \Delta_m is the maximum value of the d-wave gap,
and z_A is the weight of the coherent excitations in the spectral function.
This is highly unusual, since in nearly all phase transitions, T_c is
determined by an energy scale alone. We further show that in the
low-temperature limit, z_{\it A} increases monotonically with increasing doping
x. The growth is linear, i.e. z_A(x)\propto x, in the underdoped to optimally
doped regimes, and slows down in overdoped samples. The reduction of z_A with
increasing temperature resembles that of the c-axis superfluid density.

more detail. With a Gaussian unfolding of each spectrum the nearest neighbour
spacing distribution between ground state and first exited state is shown to be
stable. Using such an unfolding the distribution tends toward a semi-Poisson

we could use such unfolding obtaining similar results as in the early papers,

have revealed a new monoclinic phase in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase
boundary (MPB), previously regarded as the the boundary separating the
rhombohedral and tetragonal regions of the PZT phase diagram. In the present
paper, the stability region of all three phases has been established from high
resolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction measurements on a series of
highly homogeneous samples with 0.42 <=x<= 0.52. At 20K the monoclinic phase is
stable in the range 0.46 <=x<= 0.51, and this range narrows as the temperature
is increased. A first-order phase transition from tetragonal to rhombohedral
symmetry is observed only for x= 0.45. The MPB, therefore, corresponds not to
the tetragonal-rhombohedral phase boundary, but instead to the boundary between
the tetragonal and monoclinic phases for 0.46 <=x<= 0.51. This result provides
important insight into the close relationship between the monoclinic phase and
the striking piezoelectric properties of PZT; in particular, investigations of
poled samples have shown that the monoclinic distortion is the origin of the
unusually high piezoelectric response of PZT.

Contrary to the three dimensional case, the oscillations in sufficiently pure

concentration of impurities growth. In the normal quasi two-dimensional

employing a round-robin style algorithm for allocating CPU time. Unfortunately,
a loophole exists whereby the scheduler can be biased in favor of a greedy user

intrinsic property of the round-robin scheduler that ensures responsiveness to
the short CPU demands associated with multiple interactive users. A new
generation of UNIX system resource management software constrains the scheduler
to be equitable to all users regardless of the number of processes each may be
running. This ""fair-share"" scheduling draws on the concept of pro rating
resource ""shares"" across users and groups and then dynamically adjusting CPU
usage to meet those share proportions. The simple notion of statically
allocating these shares, however, belies the potential consequences for
performance as measured by user response time and service level targets. We
demonstrate this point by modeling several simple share allocation scenarios

within the context of brane world scenarios with infinite volume extra
dimensions. In such theories bulk can be supersymmetric even if brane
supersymmetry is completely broken. The bulk cosmological constant can
therefore naturally be zero. Since the volume of the extra dimensions is
infinite, it might appear that at large distances one would measure the bulk
cosmological constant which vanishes. We point out a caveat in this argument.
In particular, we use a concrete model, which is a generalization of the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, to argue that in the presence of non-zero brane
cosmological constant at large distances such a theory might become effectively
four dimensional. This is due to a mass gap in the spectrum of bulk graviton
modes. In fact, the corresponding distance scale is set precisely by the brane
cosmological constant. This phenomenon appears to be responsible for the fact
that bulk supersymmetry does not actually protect the brane cosmological
constant.

formalism. Analytic expressions for the transverse momentum and light-cone
momentum distributions are derived to all orders in powers of the gluon opacity
of the medium, $N\sigma_g/A=L/\lambda_g$. The reaction operator approach also
leads to a simple algebraic proof of the ``color triviality'' of single
inclusive distributions and to a solvable set of recursion relations. The
analytic solution generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) for
applications to mesoscopic QCD plasmas. The solution is furthermore not
restricted to uncorrelated geometries and allows for evolving screening scales
as well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The later is
particularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic constraints
significantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our solution for the
inclusive distribution also generalizes the finite order exclusive (tagged)
distribution case studied previously (GLV1). The form of the analytic solution
is well suited for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to
enable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic
nuclear collisions. Numerical results illustrating the constributions of the
first three orders in opacity are compared to the ``self-quenching'' hard
radiation intensity. A surprising result is that the induced gluon radiation
intensity is dominated by the (quadratic in $L$) first order opacity
contribution for realistic geometries and jet energies in nuclear collisions.

great enthusiasm in the students and welcomed the participation of a hundred
different people, which means an order of magnitude more than an average
graduate course at Chalmers University of Technology and G\""oteborg University.

relevant to real experiments, which by necessity only have finite precision. We
give an affirmative answer to this question by showing how to derive
hidden-variable theorems that apply to real experiments, so that non-contextual
hidden variables can indeed be experimentally disproved. The essential point is
that for the derivation of hidden-variable theorems one does not have to know
which observables are really measured by the apparatus. Predictions can be
derived for observables that are defined in an entirely operational way.

communication to transmit one instance of an unknown quantum state. Remote
state preparation (RSP) has the same goal, but the sender knows classically
what state is to be transmitted. We show that the asymptotic classical
communication cost of RSP is one bit per qubit - half that of teleportation -
and becomes even less when transmitting part of a known entangled state. We
explore the tradeoff between entanglement and classical communication required
for RSP, and discuss RSP capacities of general quantum channels.

In particular, we propose an optimal universal entangler which entangles a
qubit in unknown state $|\Psi>$ with a qubit in a reference (known) state
$|0>$. That is, our entangler generates the output state which is as close as
possible to the pure (symmetrized) state $(|\Psi>|0> +|0>|\Psi>)$. The most
attractive feature of this entangling machine, is that the fidelity of its
performance (i.e. the distance between the output and the ideally entangled --
symmetrized state) does not depend on the input and takes the constant value
$F= (9+3\sqrt{2})/14\simeq 0.946$. We also analyze how to optimally generate
from a single qubit initially prepared in an unknown state $|\Psi\r$ a two
qubit entangled system which is as close as possible to a Bell state
$(|\Psi\r|\Psi^\perp\r+|\Psi^\perp\r|\Psi\r)$, where $\l\Psi|\Psi^\perp\r =0$.

different methods of extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed
from that qubit and a set of ancilla qubits in an known state. Measuring the
whole system is, as expected, the least effective method. We present various
quantum ``devices'' which disentangle the unknown qubit from the set of ancilla
qubits. In particular, we present the optimal universal disentangler which
disentangles the unknown qubit with the fidelity which does not depend on the
state of the qubit, and a probabilistic disentangler which performs the perfect
disentangling transformation, but with a probability less than one.
