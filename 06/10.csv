periods of young or accreting neutron stars, and also to produce observable
gravitational wave radiation. R-modes involve primarily transverse,
incompressive motions of the star's fluid core. However, neutron stars gain
crusts early in their lives: therefore, r-modes also imply shear in the fluid
beneath the crust. We examine the criterion for this shear layer to become
turbulent, and derive the rate of dissipation in the turbulent regime. Unlike
dissipation from a viscous boundary layer, turbulent energy loss is nonlinear
in mode energy and can therefore cause the mode to saturate at amplitudes
typically much less than unity. This energy loss also reappears as heat below
the crust. We study the possibility of crust melting as well as its
implications for the spin evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries. Lastly, we
identify some universal features of the spin evolution that may have
observational consequences.

density spectrum similar to the one observed in the X-ray band. Finally we use
both the available optical/EUV/X-ray spectral energy distribution and the low

explaining the complicated light curves of gamma-ray bursts. Shocks produce
gamma-rays in the interaction between a precessing beam of relativistic
particles and the interstellar medium. Each time the particle beam passes the
same line of sight with the observer the inter stellar medium is pushed
outward. Subsequent interactions between the medium and the beam are delayed by
the extra distance to be traveled for the particles before the shock can form.
This results in a natural retardation and leads to an intrinsic asymmetry in
the produced light curves for gamma-ray bursts. In addition we account for the
cooling of the electron-proton plasma in the shocked region, which gives rise
to an exponential decay in the gamma-ray flux. The combination of these effects
and the precessing jet of ultra relativistic particles produces light curves
which can be directly compared with observed gamma-ray burst light curves. We
illustrate the model by fitting a number of observed gamma-ray bursts which are
hard to explain with only a precessing jet. With a genetic algorithm we are
able to fit several observed gamma-ray bursts with remarkable accuracy. We find
that for different bursts the observed fluence, assuming isotropic emission,
easily varies over four orders of magnitude from the energy generated
intrinsically.

We analyze the spectrum in the context of a self-consistent recombination

distribution in ionization parameter fits the data. For a fixed solid angle
distribution of matter surrounding a point source, this corresponds to a run of
electron density of the form, n(r) ~ r^(-3/2), which is suggestive of Bondi
accretion onto a central compact mass. Using this density profile and comparing
the resulting emission spectra with the ASCA data, the size of the X-ray
emission line region is estimated to be < 1 kpc. We also show that the derived
density as a function of radius is compatible with the X-ray recombination line

surface of a hollow cone with apex close to the nucleus. Such a structure may
result through entrainment of dense gas from a circumnuclear torus in the
galaxy disk by a low density, outflowing wind or jet. Within 40 pc of the
nucleus, the high-excitation gas takes the form of a striking, filled V-shaped
structure extending in the same direction as the larger scale high-excitation
emission. This `V' can be described as an ionization cone, though a
matter-bounded structure is also possible. The implied collimation of the
ionizing photons or gaseous outflow must occur within 2 pc of the apex of the

complex structure of HII regions, including the well known starburst ring of

elliptical ring of HII regions around the `ionization cone'. We argue that this
latter ring, which we call the nuclear ring, is intrinsically circular and
located in the plane of the galaxy disk. Abstract truncated.

into the phenyl groups, which in turn leads to enhanced confinement in the

energy of the one-photon state and raises the relative energy of the lowest

existing theories of light emission from $\pi$-conjugated polymers, strong
photoluminescence should be restricted to materials whose optical gaps are

from various random media, we found that when Bragg condition with the incident
light beam is not met then the CBS cones from opals show a triangular line
shape in excellent agreement with light diffusion theory. At Bragg condition,
however, we observed a dramatic broadening of the opal CBS cones that depends
on the incident angle and [hkl] direction. This broadening is explained as due
to the light intensity decay in course of propagation along the Bragg direction
{\em before the first} and {\em after the last} scattering events. We modified
the CBS theory to incorporate the attenuation that results from the photonic
band structure of the medium. Using the modified theory we extract from our CBS
data the light mean free path and Bragg attenuation length at different [hkl].
Our study shows that CBS measurements are a unique experimental technique to
explore photonic crystals with disorder, when other spectroscopical methods
become ambiguous due to disorder-induced broadening.

magnetic field is studied theoretically via the layered XY model with uniform
frustration. A partial duality analysis is carried out in the weak-coupling
limit. It consistently accounts for both intra-layer (pancake) and inter-layer
(Josephson) vortex excitations. The main conclusion reached is that
dislocations of the two-dimensional (2D) vortex lattices within layers drive a
unique second-order melting transition at high perpendicular fields between a
low-temperature superconducting phase that displays a Josephson effect and a
high-temperature ``normal'' phase that displays no Josephson effect. The former
state is best described by weakly coupled 2D vortex lattices, while the latter
state is best characterized by a decoupled vortex liquid. It is further argued
on the basis of the duality analysis that the second-order melting transition
converts itself into a first-order one as the perpendicular field is lowered
and approaches the dimensional cross-over scale. The resulting critical
endpoint potentially accounts for the same phenomenon that is observed in the
mixed phase of clean high-temperature superconductors.

based on a 3d tight-binding Fe model, with constant onsite Coulomb repulsion U
between electrons of opposite spin. We find it is not the total density of
Stoner states as a function of energy loss which determines the response of the
system in the Stoner region, as usually thought, but the densities of Stoner
states for only a few interband transitions. Which transitions are important
depends ultimately on how strongly umklapp processes couple the corresponding
bands. This allows us to show, in particular, that the Stoner peak in SPEELS
spectra does not necessarily indicate the value of the exchange splitting
energy. Thus, the common assumption that this peak allows us to estimate the
magnetic moment through its correlation with exchange splitting should be
reconsidered, both in bulk and surface studies. Furthermore, we are able to
show that the above mechanism is one of the main causes for the typical
broadness of experimental spectra. Finally, our model predicts that optical
spin waves should be excited in SPEELS experiments.

  Formalisms. 25-27 May 2000, Paris, France",,,,"cs.CL",,"  When people develop something intended as a large broad-coverage grammar,
they usually have a more specific goal in mind. Sometimes this goal is covering
a corpus; sometimes the developers have theoretical ideas they wish to
investigate; most often, work is driven by a combination of these two main
types of goal. What tends to happen after a while is that the community of
people working with the grammar starts thinking of some phenomena as
``central'', and makes serious efforts to deal with them; other phenomena are
labelled ``marginal'', and ignored. Before long, the distinction between
``central'' and ``marginal'' becomes so ingrained that it is automatic, and
people virtually stop thinking about the ``marginal'' phenomena. In practice,
the only way to bring the marginal things back into focus is to look at what
other people are doing and compare it with one's own work. In this paper, we
will take two large grammars, XTAG and the CLE, and examine each of them from
the other's point of view. We will find in both cases not only that important
things are missing, but that the perspective offered by the other grammar
suggests simple and practical ways of filling in the holes. It turns out that
there is a pleasing symmetry to the picture. XTAG has a very good treatment of
complement structure, which the CLE to some extent lacks; conversely, the CLE
offers a powerful and general account of adjuncts, which the XTAG grammar does
not fully duplicate. If we examine the way in which each grammar does the thing
it is good at, we find that the relevant methods are quite easy to port to the
other framework, and in fact only involve generalization and systematization of
existing mechanisms.

lightest gauge Kaluza-Klein excitation for a narrow part of the allowed range
of the assumed universal 5-dimensional fermion mass parameter, $\nu$. However,
employing both perturbativity and fine-tuning constraints we find that we can
further restrict the allowed range of the parameter $\nu$ to only one fourth of
its previous size. The scenario with the SM in the RS bulk is thus tightly
constrained, being viable for only a small region of the parameter space.

renormalization-scheme-invariant as well. We do this explicitly when two terms
beyond the leading order (NNLO, $\sim \alpha_s^3$) are known in the truncated
perturbation series (TPS). At first, the scheme dependence shows up as a
dependence on the first two scheme parameters $c_2$ and $c_3$. Invariance under
the change of the leading parameter $c_2$ is achieved via a variant of the
principle of minimal sensitivity. The subleading parameter $c_3$ is fixed so
that a scale- and scheme-invariant Borel transform of the resummation
approximant gives the correct location of the leading infrared renormalon pole.
The leading higher-twist contribution, or a part of it, is thus believed to be
contained implicitly in the resummation. We applied the approximant to the
Bjorken polarized sum rule (BjPSR) at $Q^2_{\rm ph}=5$ and $3 GeV^2$, for the
most recent data and the data available until 1997, respectively, and obtained

expanding away from one another is possible for a finite amount of time, after
which communication can proceed in one direction only. The geometrical picture
also shows that our class of solutions (and related solutions in the

hydration contributions, predicts an average hydration shell occupancy of 4.0.
This underestimate is attributed to the harmonic approximation for the clusters
in conjunction with the approximate dielectric continuum model treatment of
outer sphere contributions. Finally, a maximum entropy fitting of inner sphere
occupancies that leads to insensitive composite free energy approximations
suggests a value in the neighborhood of -68 kcal/mol for the hydration free
energy of Na+ (aq) under these conditions with no contribution supplied for
packing or van der Waals interactions.

plasma. With this collective mode we probe the electron density distribution
and study the expansion of the plasma as a function of time. For classical
plasma conditions, i.e. weak Coulomb coupling, the expansion is dominated by
the pressure of the electron gas and is described by a hydrodynamic model.
Discrepancies between the model and observations at low temperature and high
density may be due to strong coupling of the electrons.

general unified theory in which the electric dipole moment varies during a

the B''\barB 1Sigma+u - X 1Sigma+g asymptotically forbidden transition of H_2.
As a consequence, the appearance of the line wing between Lyman Alpha and Lyman
Beta is shown to be sensitive to the relative abundance of hydrogen ions and
neutral atoms, and thereby to provide a temperature diagnostic for stellar
atmospheres and laboratory plasmas.

transformations fulfill only as a good approach and become exact only when

remain valid (but modified) in case of small fractional corrections to integer
dimensions of time and space. In this paper presented the gravitation field
theory in the fractal time and space (based on the fractal theory of time and
space developed by author early). In the theory are taken into account the
alteration of Lorents transformations for case including $v=c$ and are
described the real gravitational fields with spin equal 2 in the fractal time
defined on the Riemann or Minkowski measure carrier. In the theory introduced
the new ""quasi-spin"", given four equations for gravitational fields (with
different ""quasi spins"" and real and imaginary energies). For integer
dimensions the theory coincide with Einstein GR or Logunov- Mestvirichvili
gravitation theory.

planetary atmospheric boundary layer spanning several orders of magnitude in
scales and gives rise to the observed fractal geometry for the global cloud
cover pattern. The global weather systems are manifestations of the unified
atmospheric eddy continuum with inherent mutual global-local energy exchange
and therefore local urban energy/pollution sources have long-range global
effects leading to climate change and environmental degradation. It is shown
that the observed scale invariant atmospheric eddy continuum originates from
the turbulence scale by the universal period doubling route to chaos eddy
growth phenomenon in the planetary atmospheric boundary layer. The cloud
dynamical, microphysical and electrical parameters are shown to be simple
unique functions of turbulence scale energy generation.

stationary wave function and the transient time constant $\tau_0$ is exactly
two lifetimes. We illustrate that the above formula holds both for symmetrical

incidence at different resonance energies. Theoretical evidence of a crossover
to non-exponential buildup is also discussed.
