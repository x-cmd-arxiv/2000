emission more clearly than previous attempts, some of which date back to the

well beyond the 2 kpc jet. Two ``bubbles'' of synchrotron emission appear to be
inflated by this flow. A simple model of the emission, combined with our
knowledge of the inner jet, suggests that the energy input into this region
from the M87 nucleus exceeds the energy being radiated away as X-rays. This
argues that the region within 40 kpc of the center of M87 is currently
dominated by energy input from the M87 nucleus. The gas in the region is
expanding, not flowing inward as is envisioned in the cooling flow model.

investigated for several possible dimerized configurations, some of which are
shown to have lower ground state energies than the others. In particular, the
lattice deformations resulting in alternate stronger and weaker couplings along
both the principal axes of a square lattice are shown to result in a larger
gain in magnetic energy. In addition, a `columnar' configuration is shown to
have a lower ground state energy and a faster increase in the energy gap
parameter than a `staggered' configuration. The inclusion of unexpanded
exchange coupling leads to a power law behaviour for the magnetic energy gain
and energy gap, which is qualitatively different from that reported earlier.
Instead of increasing as $\delta ^{x}$, the two quantities depend on $\delta $
as $\delta ^{\nu}/| \ln \delta | .$ This is true both in the near critical
regime $(0\leq \delta \leq 0.1)$ as well as in the far regime $(0\leq \delta
<1)$. It is suggested that the unexpanded exchange coupling is as much a source
of the logarithmic dependence as a correction due to the contribution of
umklapp processes. Staggered magnetization is shown to follow the same $\delta
$-dependence in all the configurations in the small $\delta $-regime, while for
$0\leq \delta <1$, it follows the power law $\delta ^{x}$.

approaches for IP mobility, mainly, the Mobile IP protocol. Comparison is
performed according to the required performance criteria, such as smooth
handoff and efficient routing.
  Our simulation results show significant improvement for the proposed

bandwidth, and experiences more than twice as much end-to-end and handoff
delays, as does our proposed architecture. Furthermore, we propose an extension

Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically
classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current
approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding
prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from
the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features
(duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted
for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred;
trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance.
Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the
prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the
output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task,
as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to
classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although
canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious
features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each
task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language
model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially
for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly
marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable
prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.

front exists. Numerically simulating a system of the one-dimensional
Navier-Stokes and continuity equations, we find that, in this case, the
nonsteady phase-transition front emits acoustic shocks in forward and backward
directions. Through this mechanism, the front drops its velocity and eventually
comes to a halt. The acoustic shock wave may shuttle, bouncing elastically from
the system's edge and strongly inelastically from the phase transition front.
Nonsteady rarefaction shock waves appear in the shuttle process, despite the
fact that the model does not admit steady rarefaction waves propagating between
stationary states. If the viscosity is below a certain threshold, an
instability sets in, driving the system into a turbulent state. This work was

  for Spectroscopy of Proton-Proton and other sub-MeV Solar Neutrinos",,"Phys.Rev.Lett.85:4442-4445,2000","10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4442",,"nucl-ex",,"  Discrete Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions, 176Yb-->176Lu at low excitation
energies have been measured via the (3He,t) reaction at 450 MeV and at 0
degrees. For 176Yb, two low-lying states are observed, setting low thresholds
Q(neutrino)=301 and 445 keV for neutrino capture. Capture rates estimated from
the measured GT strengths, the simple two-state excitation structure, and the
low Q(neutrino) in Yb--Lu indicate that Yb-based neutrino-detectors are well
suited for a direct measurement of the complete sub-MeV solar electron-neutrino
spectrum (including pp neutrinos) where definitive effects of flavor conversion
are expected.
