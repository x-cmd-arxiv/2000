infinite LD model does not admit solutions in the form of isolated Josephson
vortices. For the infinite LD model, we derive a closed, self-consistent system
of mean-field equations involving only two variables. Exact solutions to these
equations prove simultaneous penetration of Josephson vortices into all the
barriers, accompanied by oscillations and jumps of the magnetization, and yield
a completely new expression for the lower critical field. Moreover, the
obtained equations allow us to make self-consistent refinements on such
well-known results as the Meissner state, Fraunhofer oscillations of the
critical Josephson current, the upper critical field, and the vortex solution
of Theodorakis [S. Theodorakis, Phys. Rev. B, v. 42, 10172 (1990)]. Our
consideration of the finite LD model illuminates the role of the boundary
effect. In contrast to the infinite case, an explicit analytical solution to
the Maxwell equations of the finite case does not preclude the existence of
localized Josephson vortex configurations. By the use of this solution, we
obtain a self-consistent description of the Meissner state. Finally, we discuss
some theoretical and experimental implications.

the abundant evidence for stripe-like physics at `short' distances with the

the superconductor should be viewed as a condensate of topological excitations
associated with the fully ordered stripe phase. As we will argue, the latter
are not only a form of `straighforward' spin and charge order but also involve
a form of `hidden' or `topological' long range order which is also responsible
for the phenomenon of spin-charge separation in 1+1D. The topological
excitation associated with the destruction of this hidden order is of the most
unusual kind. We suggest that the associated disorder field theory has a
geometrical, gravity like structure concurrent with topological phases with no

  Workshop, pp. 270-274, Lansdowne, VA, 1998",,,"cs.CL",,"  A criterion for pruning parameters from N-gram backoff language models is
developed, based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned
model. It is shown that the relative entropy resulting from pruning a single
N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative
entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set
perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that
change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model.
Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its
original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the
approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and
show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative
entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of
N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving
marginally better performance.

this fact to evaluate its effect in the computation of the color gap. By first
considering the Schwinger-Dyson equations in weak coupling, when one-loop
self-energy corrections are included, a general gap equation is written in
terms of the spectral densities of the quasiparticles. To evaluate lifetime
effects, we then model the spectral density by a Lorentzian function. We argue
that the decay of the quasiparticles limits their efficiency to condense. The
value of the gap at the Fermi surface is then reduced. To leading order, these
lifetime effects can be taken into account by replacing the coupling constant

between the invariant subalgebra of the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra and
the center of the universal enveloping algebra. This version implies the
original for metrized Lie algebras (Lie algebras with an invariant
non-degenerate bilinear form). As an application of this isomorphism, we will
compute the Kontsevich integral of the unknot and the Hopf link to all orders.
  At the core of the proof, we use an elementary property of the Hopf link
which can be summarized by the equation ``1+1=2'' in abacus arithmetic:
doubling one component of the Hopf link is equivalent to taking the connected
sum of two Hopf links. This property of the Hopf link turns out, when suitably
interpreted, to be exactly the property required for the Duflo map to be
multiplicative.
  To compute the Kontsevich integral of the unknot, we use a property of the
unknot that can be summarized by ``n * 0 = 0'': the n-fold connected cabling of
the unknot is again an unknot.

amplitude for scalar meson photoproduction are derived, which yield expressions
for the invariant mass distribution of the final meson pairs. A final state
interaction form factor is obtained which incorporates $f_0$ and $a_0$ mesons,
$K\bar K$ threshold effects, and $f_0-a_0$ mixing. This form factor is applied
to predict the effective mass distribution of the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ pairs
in the vicinity of the $K\bar K$ threshold. An estimate of the role of isospin
mixing near threshold is provided. The potential role of polarized photons and
protons is also discussed.

  used","Phys.Rev. C64 (2001) 034902","10.1103/PhysRevC.64.034902",,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  The production of single photons in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at the CERN SPS as
measured by the WA98 experiment is analysed. A quark gluon plasma is assumed to
be formed initially, which expands, cools, hadronizes, and undergoes
freeze-out. A rich hadronic equation of state is used and the transverse
expansion of the interacting system is taken into account. The recent estimates
of photon production in quark-matter (at two loop level) along with the
dominant reactions in the hadronic matter leading to photons are used. About
50% of the single photons are seen to have a thermal origin. An addition of the
thermal and prompt photons is seen to provide a very good description of the
data. Most of the thermal photons having large transverse momenta arise from
the quark-matter, which contributes dominantly through the mechanism of
annihilation of quarks with scattering, and which in turn is possible only in a
hot and dense plasma of quarks and gluons. The results thus confirm the
formation of quark gluon plasma and the existence of this mechanism of the
production of single photons.

cavity to prepare the entangled state. We then discuss a scheme using
four-level atoms, which requires a parameter regime much easier to access
experimentally using current technology. As opposed to other schemes, our
proposal relies on the presence of finite decay rates and its implementation
should therefore be much less demanding.
