statistical analysis of the individual Stokes Q or U components. The
temperature-polarization cross-correlation is less affected by foreground
emission, even if the foreground polarization is highly correlated with the
foreground intensity. Polarized foregrounds, even if uncorrected, do not
dominate the uncertainty in the temperature-polarization cross-correlation for

the value of rejecting faint foregrounds with the cost of increased instrument

single scenario appears to be able to account for the wide range of specific

The fraction of all star formation that produces massive bound clusters differs
from galaxy to galaxy, and (in some cases) appears to vary with time. Presently
available data strongly suggest that the specific cluster forming frequency is
highest during violent bursts of star formation. Globular cluster systems show
a wide variety of color (metallicity) distributions, with many luminous
galaxies having double (or even multiple) metallicity peaks that were probably
produced during distinct episodes of cluster formation. The bulk of the
globulars in the main body of the Galactic halo appear to have formed during a
single short-lived burst that took place ~ 13 Gyr ago. This was followed by a
second, perhaps more extended, burst associated with the formation of the
Galactic bulge. A few metal-rich clusters may also be associated with the
formation of the Galactic Thick Disk. Finally many of the clusters beyond RGc ?
15 kpc might have been formed in dwarf spheroidal galaxies that, after a few
Gyr, were accreted by the main body of the Galactic halo. Some of these outer
clusters are younger, and less luminous, than the majority of globular clusters
formed at smaller Galactocentric distances.

applied to near-IR (0.95 - 2.50 micron) NTT/SOFI spectra of the lensed,
radio-quiet quasar HE 1104-1805. The continuum of the lensing galaxy is
revealed between 1.5 and 2.5 micron. It is used in combination with previous
optical and IR photometry to infer a plausible redshift in the range 0.8 < z <
1.2. Modeling of the system shows that the lens is probably composed of the red
galaxy seen between the quasar images and a more extended component associated
with a galaxy cluster with fairly low velocity dispersion (~ 575 km/s). The
spectra of the two lensed images of the source show no trace of reddening at
the redshift of the lens nor at the redshift of the source. Additionally, the
difference between the spectrum of the brightest component a nd that of a
scaled version of the faintest component is a featureless continuum. Broad and
narrow emission lines, including the FeII features, are perfectly subtracted.
The very good quality of our spectrum makes it possible to fit precisely the
optical Fe II feature, taking into account the underlying continuum over a wide
wavelength range. HE 1104-1805 can be classified as a weak Fe II emitter.
Finally, the slope of the continuum in the brightest image is steeper than the
continuum in the faintest image and supports the finding by Wisotzki et al.
(1993) that the brightest image is microlensed. This is particularly
interesting in view of the new source reconstruction methods from
multiwavelength photometric monitoring.

date and is the most metal-poor RRd ever detected. Based on BVI CCD photometry
spanning eleven years of observations, we find that CU Comae has periods
P0=0.5441641 +/-0.0000049d and P1=0.4057605 +/-0.0000018d. The amplitude of the
primary (first-overtone) period of CU Comae is about twice the amplitude of the
secondary (fundamental) period. The combination of the fundamental period of
pulsation P0 and the period ratio of P1/P0=0.7457 places the variable on the
metal-poor side of the Petersen diagram, in the region occupied by M68 and M15
RRd's. A mass of 0.83 solar masses is estimated for CU Comae using an updated
theoretical calibration of the Petersen diagram. High resolution spectroscopy
(R=30,000) covering the full pulsation cycle of CU Comae was obtained with the
2.7 m telescope of the Mc Donald Observatory, and has been used to build up the
radial velocity curve of the variable. Abundance analysis done on the four
spectra taken near minimum light (phase: 0.54 -- 0.71) confirms the metal poor
nature of CU Comae, for which we derive [Fe/H]=-2.38 +/-0.20. This value places
this new RRd at the extreme metal-poor edge of the metallicity distribution of
the RR Lyrae variables in our Galaxy.

difficult to detect in x-ray or optical surveys compared with the conventional

define a new population of ``gamma-ray clusters''. If this hypothesis is true,
the next generation gamma-ray telescopes such as GLAST will detect more than a
few thousands of gamma-ray clusters. It would provide a new tracer of
dynamically evolving structures in the universe, in contrast to the x-ray

masses and helium abundances are derived for 42 hot horizontal branch (HB)
stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. For 19 stars we derive magnesium and
iron abundances as well and find that iron is enriched by a factor of 50 on
average with respect to the cluster abundance whereas the magnesium abundances
are consistent with the cluster abundance. Radiation pressure may levitate
heavy elements like iron to the surface of the star in a diffusive process.
Taking into account the enrichment of heavy elements in our spectroscopic
analyses we find that high iron abundances can explain part, but not all, of
the problem of anomalously low gravities along the blue HB. The blue HB stars
cooler than about 15,100 K and the sdB stars (Teff > 20,000 K) agree well with
canonical theory when analysed with metal-rich ([M/H] = +0.5) model
atmospheres, but the stars in between these two groups remain offset towards
lower gravities and masses. Deep Mixing in the red giant progenitor phase is
discussed as another mechanism that may influence the position of the blue HB
stars in the (Teff, log g)-plane but not their masses.

supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) during the electroweak phase transition.
We find that the dominant source for baryogenesis arises from the chargino
sector. The CP-violation comes from the complex phase in the mu parameter,
which provides CP-odd contributions to the particle dispersion relations. This
leads to different accelerations for particles and antiparticles in the wall
region which, combined with diffusion, leads to the separation of Higgsinos and
their antiparticles in the front of the wall. These asymmetries get transported
to produce perturbations in the left-handed chiral quarks, which then drive
sphaleron interactions to create the baryon asymmetry. We present a complete
derivation of the semiclassical WKB formalism, including the chargino
dispersion relations and a self-consistent derivation of the diffusion
equations starting from semiclassical Boltzmann equations for WKB-excitations.
We stress the advantages of treating the transport equations in terms of the
manifestly gauge invariant physical energy and kinetic momentum, rather than in
the gauge variant canonical variables used in previous treatments. We show that
a large enough baryon asymmetry can be created for the phase of the complex mu
parameter as small as ~ 0.001, which is consistent with bounds from the neutron
electric dipole moment.

earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos with all three active neutrinos.
We illustrate that the earth effect on low energy solar neutrinos ($E_\nu < 20$
MeV) causes large variations in the survival probabilities for large values of
the mixing angle $\theta_{12}$ for a given value of $\theta_{13}$. But it is
maximal for small values of $\theta_{13}$ and diminishes for large values at a
given value of $\theta_{12}$. The nadir angle dependence is sensitive to the
value of $E'\equiv E/\Delta_{12}$. As far as low energy solar neutrinos are
concerned we notice that the earth effect is more pronounced for core
penetration. We confirm that the earth effect leaves the SMA region almost
intact regardless of $\theta_{13}$ and that it is significant for high energy
$^8$B and $hep$ neutrinos in the LMA region. We also show that for large values
of $\theta_{13}$, the earth effect is significant for high energy neutrinos
($E'\gtrsim 10^9$) and it can be large at any nadir angle.

We show that the Hamiltonian with no ground state corresponds to a gauge in
which there is an obstruction at the boundary of spacetime requiring a
modification of the quantization rules. The redefinition of the Hamiltonian a
la DFF corresponds to a different choice of gauge. The latter is a good gauge
leading to standard quantization rules. Thus, the DFF trick is a consequence of
a standard gauge-fixing procedure in the case of black hole scattering.

been derived where a pairing mechanism, which is analogous to the Bardeen-
Cooper- Schrieffer one, has been singled out explicitely. A ""refining""
procedure for the phenomenological single- particle energies and pairing gaps
is formulated to avoid double counting of the phonon mixing if the initial data
of the problem are these phenomenological quantities. The general equations
obtained have been written in the squared phonon creation amplitude
approximation. This corresponds to taking quasiparticle$\otimes$phonon
configurations into account and, as shown in the work, is a good approximation
for semi- magic nuclei. Using this approximation the secular equation to
calculate excitations of odd non- magic nuclei has been obtained. The equation
takes ground state correlations into account completely and contains only the
squared energy variable. Distributions of single- particle strength in 119Sn
and 121}Sn have been calculated and reasonable agreement with the available
experiment has been obtained.

investigated within the constituent quark model formulated on the light-front.
It is shown that the kinematical SU(6) breaking caused by the Melosh rotations
of the quark spins as well as the dynamical SU(6) breaking due to the
mixed-symmetry component generated in the nucleon wave function by the
spin-dependent terms of the quark-quark interaction, can affect both GEn(Q**2)
and GMp(Q**2)/GMn(Q**2). The calculated GEn(Q**2) is found to be qualitatively
consistent with existing data. while the calculations of GM(Q**2) based on the
plus component of the current are found to be plagued by spurious effects
related to the loss of the rotational covariance in the light-front formalism.
These unwanted effects can be avoided by considering the transverse y-component
of the current. In this way our light-front predictions are found to be
consistent with the data on both GEn(Q**2) and GMp(Q**2)/GMn(Q**2). Finally, it
is shown that a suppression of the ratio GEp(Q**2)/GMp(Q**2) with respect to
the dipole-fit prediction can be expected in the constituent quark model
provided the relativistic effects generated by the Melosh rotations of the
constituent spins are taken into account.

of the external force, if the parameters of the system experience rapid change
due to the changes in its internal structure. This excitation is collision-like
and does not require any phase coherence or periodicity. The change of the
internal structure may be achieved by other means which may require much lower
energy expenses. The mechanism suggests control over switching oscillations on
and off and may be of practical use.

distribution function of a collisionless Boltzmann gas keeps invariant along a
molecule's path represents not the strength but the weakness of the standard
theory. One of its consequences states that the velocity distribution at any
point is a condensed ``image'' of all, complex and even discontinuous,
structures of the entire spatial space. Admitting the inability to describe the
entire space with a microscopic quantity, this paper introduces a new type of
distribution function, called the solid-angle-average distribution function.
With help of the new distribution function, the dynamical behavior of
collisionless Boltzmann gas is formulated in terms of a set of integrals
defined by molecular paths. In the new formalism, not only that the
difficulties associated with the standard theory are surmounted but also that
some of practical gases become calculable in terms of today's computer.

detection rates or other correlations, but never in the rate of single-photon
detection. We observe nonclassical interference in a singles rate, thanks to
the intrinsic nonlinearity of photon counters. This is due to a dependence of
the effective detection efficiency on the quantum statistics of the light beam.
Such measurements of detector response to photon pairs promise to shed light on
the microscopic aspects of silicon photodetectors, and on general issues of
quantum measurement and decoherence.

which connects F with a given fixed frame F_0. If F is a quantum frame, defined
by a physical object following the laws of quantum physics, the parameters of g
have to be considered as quantum observables. However, these observables are
not compatible and some of them, namely the coordinates of the origin of F,
cannot be represented by self-adjoint operators. Both these difficulties can be
overcome by considering a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) on P,
covariant with respect to the left translations of the group, namely a
covariance system. We develop a construction procedure for this kind of
mathematical structure. The formalism is also used to discuss the quantum
observables measured with respect to a quantum reference frame.
