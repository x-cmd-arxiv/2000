SED's ranging from pre-protostellar to Class I (18K < Tbol < 370K), using SCUBA
at the JCMT. In this paper we present the maps, radial intensity profiles, and
photometry. Pre-protostellar cores do not have power-law intensity profiles,
whereas the intensity profiles of Class 0 and Class I sources can be fitted
with power laws over a large range of radii. A substantial number of sources
have companion sources within a few arcminutes (2 out of 5 pre-protostellar
cores, 9 out of 16 Class 0/I sources). The mean separation between sources is
10800 AU. The median separation is 18000 AU including sources without
companions as a lower limit. The mean value of the spectral index between 450
and 850 microns is 2.8 +- 0.4, with PPCs having slightly lower spectral indices
(2.5 +- 0.4). The mean mass of the sample, based on the dust emission in a 120
arcsecond aperture, is 1.1 +- 0.9 solar masses. For the sources fitted by
power-law intensity distributions (I_nu(b)/I_nu(0) = (b/b_0) ^ m), the mean
value of m is 1.52 +- 0.45 for Class 0 and I sources at 850 microns and 1.44 +-
0.25 at 450 microns. Based on a simple analysis, assuming the emission is in
the Rayleigh-Jeans limit and that T_d(r) ~ r ^ {-0.4}, these values of m
translate into power-law density distributions (n ~ r ^ {-p}) with p ~ 2.1.
However, we show that this result may be changed by more careful consideration
of effects such as beam size and shape, finite outer radii, more realistic
T_d(r), and failure of the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.

to a prediction of a unique nonsingular isothermal sphere for the equilibrium
structure, with a core density which is proportional to the mean background
density at the epoch of collapse. These predicted nonsingular isothermal
spheres are in good agreement with observations of the internal structure of
dark-matter-dominated halos from dwarf galaxies to X-ray clusters. Our model
also reproduces many of the average properties of halos in CDM simulations to
good accuracy, suggesting that it is a useful analytical approximation for
halos which form from realistic initial conditions. While CDM N-body
simulations find profiles with a central cusp, our nonsingular model matches
the simulated halos outside the innermost region well. This model may also be
of interest as a description of halos in nonstandard CDM models like
self-interacting dark matter, which have been proposed to eliminate the
discrepancy between the cuspy halos of standard CDM simulations and observed
halos with uniform-density cores.

are significant differences between their distributions, due to the effects of
density and of shocks. Aromatic Infrared Bands are seen at various places in
the field but they are generally faint. They exhibit a variety of shapes and
relative intensities, suggesting that a diversity of carbonaceous materials are
present. Silicate emission is also clearly visible in the central condensation
and in a few others and emission from hot small grains longward of 10 microns
is present in the whole region. All these dust components are heated by the
very strong far UV radiation of the many young, massive stars contained in the
region. The interstellar radiation field (ISRF) at 1600 A is >= 10^5 times the
ISRF of the solar neighborhood in the peaks of MIR emission. The relative
contributions of the dust components to the MIR spectra seem to depend on the
intensity and the hardness of the far UV field. In general the 15/6.75 microns
intensity ratio is higher than in relatively quiescent galactic regions but it
is not as high as expected for a linear increase with ISRF. We interpret this

investigated. The resulting flow, which is essentially the prototype of the
alpha^2 dynamo of mean-field dynamo theory, produces strong dynamo action with
an additional large scale field on the scale of the box (at wavenumber k=1;
forcing is at k=5). This large scale field is nearly force-free and exceeds the
equipartition value. As the magnetic Reynolds number R_m increases, the
saturation field strength and the growth rate of the dynamo increase. However,
the time it takes to built up the large scale field from equipartition to its
final super-equipartition value increases with magnetic Reynolds number. The
large scale field generation can be identified as being due to nonlocal
interactions originating from the forcing scale, which is characteristic of the
alpha-effect. Both alpha and turbulent magnetic diffusivity eta_t are
determined simultaneously using numerical experiments where the mean-field is
modified artificially. Both quantities are quenched in a R_m-dependent fashion.
The evolution of the energy of the mean field matches that predicted by an
alpha^2 dynamo model with similar alpha and eta_t quenchings. For this model an
analytic solution is given which matches the results of the simulations. The
simulations are numerically robust in that the shape of the spectrum at large
scales is unchanged when changing the resolution from 30^3 to 120^3 meshpoints,
or when increasing the magnetic Prandtl number (viscosity/magnetic diffusivity)
from 1 to 100. Increasing the forcing wavenumber to 30 (i.e. increasing the
scale separation) makes the inverse cascade effect more pronounced, although it
remains otherwise qualitatively unchanged.

again to second order. Our method uses an exact statistical treatment based on
the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation to propagate the probability distribution of
the initial mass field to the final redshifted galaxy density field. We derive
the moment generating function of the PDF and use it to find a new, closed-form

our formalism is general enough to allow a non-deterministic (or stochastic)

factor of two) than previously derived by using empirical calibrations based on
the optical oxygen lines. In the brightest region, 74C, the observation of a
prominent feature due to Wolf-Rayet stars provides an excellent constraint over
some properties of the ionizing clusters. In the light of the current
evolutionary synthesis models, no consistent solution is found to explain at

spectrum of this region. In principle, the presence of WR stars could lead to
large temperature fluctuations and also to a hardening of the ionizing

functions (LF) for QSs in the redshift range $z<3$. Based on BH paradigm, we

fueling is triggered by the encounters of a gas-rich host with its companions
in a group. The dispersion of the dynamical parameters in the encounters
produces a double power-law LF. Strong luminosity evolution (LE) is produced as
these encounters deplete the gas supply in the host; an additional, milder
density evolution obtains since the interactions become progressively rarer as
the groups grow richer but less dense. From the agreement with the optical and
the X-ray data, we conclude that the evolution of the bright quasars is
articulated in two ways. Earlier than $z~3$ the gas-rich protogalaxies grow by
merging, which also induces parallel growth of central holes accreting at
Eddington rates. In the later era of group assemblage the host encounters with
companions drive onto already existing holes further but meager accretion;
these consume the gas in the hosts, and cause supply-limited emissions which
are intermittent, go progressively sub-Eddington and peter out. Then other
fueling processes come to the foreground; we discuss the faint emissions,
especially noticeable in X-rays, which are expected when hosts in the field
cannibalize satellite galaxies with their meager gas contents.

This is significant of a strong confinement of coherence along the chains.

developing a numerical method, we first discuss the dynamical coupling between

generalizes the single-relaxation time lattice-Boltzmann method for the
simulation of hydrodynamic interfaces to include the elastic properties of the
boundary. The implementation of the new method is outlined and it is tested by
simulating the static behavior of spherical bubbles and the dynamics of bending
waves. By means of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem we recover analytically
the equilibrium frequency power spectrum of thermally fluctuating membranes and
the correlation function of the excitations. Also, the non-equilibrium scaling
properties of the membrane roughening are deduced, leading us to formulate a
scaling law describing the interface growth, W^2(L,T)=L^3 g[t/L^(5/2)], where
W, L and T are the width of the interface, the linear size of the system and
the temperature respectively, and g is a scaling function. Finally, the
phenomenology of thermally fluctuating membranes is simulated and the frequency
power spectrum is recovered, confirming the decay of the correlation function
of the fluctuations. As a further numerical study of fluctuating elastic
interfaces, the non-equilibrium regime is reproduced by initializing the system
as an interface immersed in thermally pre-excited fluids.

In sources with high phase-space densities, multi-boson effects modify the
Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radius parameters and simultaneously generate strong
residual correlations. We clarify their effect on the correlation strength
(intercept parameter) and thus explain a variety of previously reported
puzzling multi-boson symmetrization phenomena. Using a class of analytically
solvable Gaussian source models, with and without space-momentum correlations,
we present a comprehensive overview of multi-boson symmetrization effects on
particle interferometry. For event ensembles of (approximately) fixed
multiplicity, the residual correlations lead to a minimum in the correlation
function at non-zero relative momentum, which can be practically exploited to
search, in a model-independent way, for multi-boson symmetrization effects in
high-energy heavy-ion experiments.

address these difficulties we find a new representation for the asymptotic form

try to define a cross section at forward angles, however, we work instead with

graph-based lattice models of statistical mechanics. In particular, using
techniques associated with the Temperley-Lieb algebra and fusion, a set of
boundary Boltzmann weights which satisfies the boundary Yang-Baxter equation is
obtained for each boundary condition. When appropriately specialized, these
boundary weights, each of which depends on three spins, decompose into more
natural two-spin edge weights. The specialized boundary conditions for the
A-D-E cases are naturally in one-to-one correspondence with the conformal
boundary conditions of sl(2) unitary minimal conformal field theories.
Supported by this and further evidence, we conclude that, in the continuum
scaling limit, the integrable boundary conditions provide realizations of the
complete set of conformal boundary conditions in the corresponding field
theories.

apparent paradox because, although a time operator is canonically conjugate to

paradox, we work in a representation where the phase operator is diagonal. The
boundary condition on wave functions is such that they be periodic in the phase
variable, which is related to the (continuous) eigenvalue of the time operator.
Matrix elements of the commutator of the time operator with the Hamiltonian
involve the phase variable itself in addition to periodic functions of the

includes the phase variable itself. The apparent paradox is resolved when this

frontiers of modern theoretical physics like Quantum Gravity, String Theories,

of modern mathematics. But even within non-relativistic quantum mechanics
itself there are fundamental unresolved problems that can be formulated in
elementary terms. These problems are also related to challenging open questions
of modern mathematics; linear algebra and functional analysis in particular.
Two of these problems will be discussed in this article: a) the separability
problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system does
not contain any quantum correlations or entanglement and b) the distillability
problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system can be
transformed to an entangled pure state using local operations (local refers
