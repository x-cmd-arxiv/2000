hadroproduction by primary gamma rays incident upon the earth's atmosphere; for
the results presented in this paper, only primary angles at 0 degrees from
zenith are considered. The FLUKA code is believed to be quite accurate in
reproducing experimental photon hadroproduction data in the 1 GeV to 10 TeV
energy range studied. The charged pions which are so produced can decay to
muons with sufficient energy to reach ground level. The number of these muons
and their radial and energy distribution are studied for incident gamma ray
energies from 1 GeV to 10 TeV. The number of these muons is not negligible;
they can, in certain circumstances, be used to study potential sources of gamma
rays like gamma ray bursts. It is found, for example, that a 10 TeV incident
primary gamma ray produces, on average, 3.4 muons which reach ground level; the
gamma ray energy which produces the maximum number of muons at ground level
depends on the spectral index of the primary gamma spectrum, a constant which
describes how the primary gamma flux rises with decreasing primary energy. An
example: for a differential spectral index of 2.7, there is a broad maximum
number of muons coming from ~ 30 GeV primary gamma ray energy.

This data set has allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of the
characteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency nu_a and peak frequency
nu_m, and the peak flux density F_m: we obtain nu_a \propto t^{-0.15 +- 0.12},
nu_m \propto t^{-1.7 +- 0.4}, and $_m \propto t^{-0.47 +- 0.11}. From the radio
data we find that models of homogeneous or wind-generated ambient media with a

relativistic outflow is collimated (a jet) can account for the observed
evolution of the synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at optical
wavelengths, and the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions that
we present here, provided that the jet transition has not been fully completed
in the first two weeks after the event. These observations provide additional
evidence that rapidly decaying optical/X-ray afterglows are due to jets and
that such transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach the

that naturally explains the properties of the Fe K line, specifically the
detection of the centroid line energy below 6.7 keV and the apparent broadness
of the line. Motivated by recent evidence of nonthermal components in the
spectrum of the Galactic X-ray/gamma-ray background, we consider a model that
is a mixture of thermal plasma components of perhaps supernova origin and
nonthermal emission from the interaction of low energy Cosmic ray electrons
(LECRe) with the interstellar medium. The LECRe may be accelerated in supernova
explosions or by ambient interstellar plasma turbulence. Atomic collisions of
fast electrons produce characteristic nonthermal, narrow X-ray emission lines
that can explain the complex Galactic background spectrum. Using the ASCA GIS
archival data from the Scutum arm region, we show that a two-temperature
thermal plasma model with kT~0.6 and ~2.8 keV, plus a LECRe component models
the data satisfactorily. Our analysis rules out a purely nonthermal origin for
the emission. It also rules out a significant contribution from low energy
Cosmic ray ions, because their nonthermal X-ray production would be accompanied
by a nuclear gamma-ray line diffuse emission exceeding the upper limits
obtained using OSSE, as well as by an excessive Galaxy-wide Be production rate.
The proposed model naturally explains the observed complex line features and
removes the difficulties associated with previous interpretations of the data
which evoked a very hot thermal component (kT~7 keV).

consistent with jet-like behavior in which a power-law decay steepens from
t**(-1.22 +/- 0.04) at early times to t**(-1.53 +/- 0.05) in a gradual
transition at around 2 d. The derivation of the late-time decay slope takes
into account the constant contribution of a host or intervening galaxy which
was measured 110 d after the event at R = 24.56 +/- 0.14, although the light
curve deviates from a single power law whether or not a constant term is
included. The early-time spectral energy distribution of the afterglow can be
described as F_nu ~ nu**(-0.74 +/- 0.05) or flatter between optical and X-ray,
which, together with the slow initial decay, is characteristic of standard
adiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium. Assuming that a reported
absorption-line redshift of 1.02 is correct, the apparent isotropic energy of
6.7 x 10**53 erg is reduced by a factor of ~ 200 in the jet model, and the
initial half-opening angle is ~ 6 deg. GRB 991216 is the third good example of
a jet-like afterglow (following GRB 990123 and GRB 990510), supporting a trend
in which the apparently most energetic gamma-ray events have the narrowest
collimation and a uniform ISM environment. This, plus the absence of evidence
for supernovae associated with jet-like afterglows, suggests that these events
may originate from a progenitor in which angular momentum plays an important

Kelvin-Helmholtz (or shear-layer) instabilities plays a basic role in the
understanding the origin and physical characteristics of these objects.
Numerical simulations by Bodo et al. (1998) have shown that the
three-dimensional non-linear evolution of KH instabilities in supersonic jets
is substantially faster than in the two-dimensional case, leading to a cascade
of modes towards smaller scales and a very effective mixing and momentum
transfer to the ambient medium. On the other hand, Rossi et al. (1997) and
Micono et al. (1998) found, in two dimensions, that radiative losses tend to
reduce and delay mixing effects and momentum transfer to the ambient medium. In
this paper, as a logical next step, we investigate the effects of radiative
losses on the stability of 3D supersonic jets, assuming that the internal jet
density is initially lower, equal and higher than the ambient medium,
respectively. We find that light and equal-density radiative jets evolve in a
qualitatively similar fashion with respect to the corresponding adiabatic ones.
Conversely, we note substantial differences in the evolution of heavy jets:
they remain more collimated and do not spread out, while the momentum gained by
the ambient medium stays within ~ 5 jet radii.

In the formalism proposed by Webbink (1984), we can constrain the efficiency of
the deposition of orbital energy into the envelope to be $1 \la \alpha \la 6$,
for an envelope structure parameter $\lambda=0.5$. We find that the two
standard mass transfer types (stable mass transfer and spiral-in) are both
unable to explain the first phase of mass transfer for these three binaries.
  We use a parametric approach to describe mass transfer in low-mass binaries,
where both stars are of comparable mass and find that the orbital
characteristics of the observed double helium white dwarfs can be well
reproduced if the envelope of the primary is lost with ~1.5 times the specific
angular momentum of the initial binary. In this case no substantial spiral-in
occurs.

To be published in Reviews of Modern Physics",,"10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1041",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  This review discusses progress in efficient solvers which have as their
foundation a representation in real space, either through finite-difference or
finite-element formulations. The relationship of real-space approaches to
linear-scaling electrostatics and electronic structure methods is first
discussed. Then the basic aspects of real-space representations are presented.
Multigrid techniques for solving the discretized problems are covered; these
numerical schemes allow for highly efficient solution of the grid-based
equations. Applications to problems in electrostatics are discussed, in
particular numerical solutions of Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equations.
Next, methods for solving self-consistent eigenvalue problems in real space are
presented; these techniques have been extensively applied to solutions of the
Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham equations of electronic structure, and to eigenvalue
problems arising in semiconductor and polymer physics. Finally, real-space
methods have found recent application in computations of optical response and
excited states in time-dependent density functional theory, and these
computational developments are summarized. Multiscale solvers are competitive
with the most efficient available plane-wave techniques in terms of the number
of self-consistency steps required to reach the ground state, and they require
less work in each self-consistency update on a uniform grid. Besides excellent
efficiencies, the decided advantages of the real-space multiscale approach are
1) the near-locality of each function update, 2) the ability to handle global
eigenfunction constraints and potential updates on coarse levels, and 3) the
ability to incorporate adaptive local mesh refinements without loss of optimal
multigrid efficiencies.

We explore the possibility of relating the distribution of Poincare' recurrence

inverse power law. This is the dynamic property that Zaslavsly [Phys.Today(8),
39(1999)] finds to be responsible for a striking deviation from ordinary
statistical mechanics under the form of Maxwell's Demon effect. We show that
this way of estabi- lishing a connection between thermodynamics and dynamics is
valid only in the case of strong chaos. In the case of sporadic randomness,
resulting at long times in the Levy diffusion processes,the sensitivity to
initial conditions is initially an inverse pow erlaw,but it becomes exponential
in the long-time scale, whereas the distribution of Poincare times keeps its
inverse power law forever. We show that a nonextensive thermodynamics would
imply the Maxwell's Demon effect to be determined by memory and thus to be
temporary,in conflict with the dynamic approach to Levy statistics. The
adoption of heuristic arguments indicates that this effect,is possible, as a
form of genuine equilibrium,after completion of the process of memory erasure.

natural multi-mode device, i.e., it is capable of independently gathering
information on all five quadrupole and one monopole amplitudes of a general
incoming GW. This is because the sphere's degenerate oscillation eigenmodes are
uniquely matched to the structure of the GWs' Riemann tensor components.
Suitable linear combinations of the system readout channels completely
deconvolve the six GW amplitudes. The present article is concerned with the
theoretical reasons for the remarkable properties of a spherical GW detector.
The analysis proceeds from first principles and is based on essentially no 'ad
hoc' hypotheses. The mathematical beauty of the theory is outstanding, and
abundant detail is given for a thorough understanding of the fundamental facts
and ideas. Experimental evidence of the accuracy of the model is also provided,
where possible.

that, in the three-flavour oscillation case, P{alpha,beta} is different from

lepton asymmetry, which gets converted into the present observed baryon
asymmetry of the Universe through the electroweak sphalerons. This model
requires the presence of certain nonholomorphic R-parity violating terms. For
completeness we also present the most general R-parity violating Lagrangian

family of flows produced by three point-vortices of different signs. A collapse
of all three vortices to a single point is then possible. Tracer dynamics is
analyzed by numerical construction of Poincar\'{e} sections, and is found to be
strongly chaotic: advection pattern in the region around the center of
vorticity is dominated by a well developed stochastic sea, which grows as the
vortex system approaches the collapse; at the same time, the islands of regular
motion around vortices, known as vortex cores, shrink. An estimation of the
core's radii from the minimum distance of vortex approach to each other is
obtained. Tracer transport was found to be anomalous: for all of the three
numerically investigated cases, the variance of the tracer distribution grows
faster than a linear function of time, corresponding to a super-diffusive
regime. The transport exponent varies with time decades, implying the presence
of multi-fractal transport features. Yet, its value is never too far from 3/2,
indicating some kind of universality. Statistics of Poincar\'{e} recurrences is
non-Poissonian: distributions have long power-law tails. The anomalous
properties of tracer statistics are the result of the complex structure of the
advection phase space, in particular, of strong stickiness on the boundaries
between the regions of chaotic and regular motion. The role of the different
phase space structures involved in this phenomenon is analyzed. Based on this
analysis, a kinetic description is constructed, which takes into account
different time and space scalings by using a fractional equation.

the size of attractor. In the main region of our studies the dependence of all
dimensionless characteristics of the chaotic attractor on parameter $F$ is very

spectral fluctuations emerge as average behavior of a family of quantum
dynamics drawn from a control parameter interval which becomes vanishingly
small in the classical limit; the family thus corresponds to a single classical
system. We also argue that classically integrable dynamics cannot produce
universal spectral fluctuations since their level dynamics resembles a nearly
ideal Pechukas-Yukawa gas.

A disease that scares us not only because it
is fatal but also because its insidious time course makes us all potential
carriers long before it hands us our heads in a basket. The strange three stage
dynamics of aids is also one of the major puzzles in describing the disease
theoretically (1). Aids starts, like most diseases, in a peak of virus
expression (2,3), which is practically wiped out by the immune system. However
it then remains in the body at a low level of expression until later (some time
years later) when there is an outbreak of the disease which terminally cripples
the immune system causing death from various common pathogens. In this paper we
show, using a microscopic simulation, that the time course of AIDS is
determined by the interactions of the virus and the immune cells in the shape
space of antigens and that it is the virus's ability to move more rapidly in
this space (it's high mutability) that causes the time course and eventual
'victory' of the disease. These results open the way for further experimental
and therapeutic conclusions in the ongoing battle with the HIV epidemic.

2 x 2 system, which lead to a stratification of the 6D set of N=4 pure states.

  changes",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We suggest solving the measurement problem by postulating the existence of a
special future final boundary condition for the universe. Although this is an
extension of the way boundary conditions are usually chosen (in terrestrial
laboratories), it is our only deviation from standard quantum mechanics. Using
two state vectors, or the ""two-state"", to describe completely the state of
systems of interest, we analyze ideal and ""weak"" measurements, and show the
consistency of our scheme. If the final state of a measuring device is assigned
to be one of the possible outcomes of the measurement, an effective reduction
is observed after an ideal measurement process. For final conditions chosen
with an appropriate distribution, the predictions of standard quantum mechanics
may be reconstructed, thus eliminating probability from the description of any
single measurement. The interpretation attained, the Teleological
Interpretation, is an ontological one; it is local and deterministic. Other
special assumptions in the choice of the final boundary condition may explain
certain unaccounted for phenomena, or even supply a mechanism for essential
free will. In this context we believe that a new conception of time should be
adopted.

special properties of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian and can be extended to
more general situations. In this approach the contribution of the dominant
semiclassical paths and the relevant fluctuations about them are evaluated.
