the cluster were acquired in order to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk
fraction in the cluster. From an analysis of the JHKL colors of all sources in
our largest area, we find an infrared excess fraction of > 86%. The JHKL colors
suggest that the infrared excesses arise in circumstellar disks, indicating
that the majority of the sources which formed in the NGC 2024 cluster are
currently surrounded by, and likely formed with circumstellar disks. The excess
fractions remain very high, within the errors, even at the faintest L
magnitudes from our deeper surveys suggesting that disks form around the
majority of the stars in very young clusters such as NGC 2024 independent of
mass. From comparison with published JHKL observations of Taurus, we find the K
- L excess fraction in NGC 2024 to be consistent with a high initial incidence
of circumstellar disks in both NGC 2024 and Taurus. Because NGC 2024 represents
a region of much higher stellar density than Taurus, this suggests that disks
may form around most of the YSOs in star forming regions independent of
environment. We find a relatively constant JHKL excess fraction with increasing
cluster radius, indicating that the disk fraction is independent of location in
the cluster. In contrast, the JHK excess fraction increases rapidly toward the
central region of the cluster, and is most likely due to contamination of the K
band measurements by bright nebulosity in the central regions of the cluster.
We identify 45 candidate protostellar sources in the central regions of the NGC
2024 cluster, and find a lower limit on the protostellar phase of early stellar

this event the average pulse profiles contained faint ``ghost'' pulse

components by a nearly frequency independent time delay that quadratically
diminished to zero over a month. After the dispersion event there was an order
of magnitude increase in the level of scattering, as measured by pulse

a slowing down, at both frequencies at the time of the dispersion jump which we

this slowing down can be explained by the variable perturbing optics of a
triangular plasma prism that is located in the filamentary interface between
the synchrotron nebula and the supernova ejecta and which crosses the line of

are reasonable given previous observations and analysis of these filaments. Our

an equipartition magnetic field near the event horizons of the underlying

the drag induced by curvature radiation. Estimates of the SED (spectral energy

losses arising from photo-pion production in proton collisions with these

photon field is likely to be a limiting factor. Accretion rates on the order of
one solar mass per year, comparable to the Bondi rates and to the stellar mass
loss rates, are associated with (greater than 100 EeV) cosmic ray generation in
the other (electromagnetically dark) galactic core sites. If these sites are

where time-averages are recorded. An RFI ``reference signal,'' is constructed
from the cross power spectrum of the signals from the two polarizations of a
reference horn pointed at the source of the RFI signal. The RFI signal paths
obey simple phase and amplitude closure relations, which allows computation of
the RFI contamination in the astronomical data and the corrections to be
applied to the astronomical spectra.
  Since the method is immune to the effects of multipath scattering in both the

is found that inclusion of the diffusion term which Shaviv neglected in his
analysis results in rather mild growth whose growth rate is $\ll 100$ instead
of enormous amplification $\sim 10^4$ of Shaviv's original claim since the
diffusion suppresses the growth. The growth factor strongly depends on the
amplitude of the large scale velocity field. The nonlinear growth mechanism is
applied to density perturbations of general adiabatic cold dark matter (CDM)

baryon density perturbations are not completely erased by diffusion damping if
there exists gravitational potential of CDM. With employing the perturbed rate
equation which is derived in this paper, the nonlinear evolution of baryon
density perturbations is investigated. It is found that: (1) The nonlinear
growth is larger for smaller scales. This mechanism only affects the
perturbations whose scales are smaller than $\sim 10^2M_\odot$, which are
coincident with the stellar scales. (2) The maximum growth factors of baryon

law) are frequently observed from accreting black holes. These components are
presumably associated with the different parts of the accretion flow (optically
thick and optically thin respectively) in the vicinity of the compact source.
Most of the aperiodic variability of the X-ray flux on the short time scales is
associated with the harder component. We suggest that drastically different
amplitudes of variability of these two components are simply related to the
very different viscous time scales in the geometrically thin and geometrically
thick parts of the accretion flow. In the geometrically thin disks variations
of viscosity or mass accretion rate occurring at large radius from the black
hole on the local dynamical or thermal time scales do not cause any significant
variations of the mass accretion rate at smaller radii due to a very long
diffusion time. Any variations on the time scales shorter than the diffusion
time scale are effectively dampened. On the contrary such variations can easily
survive in the geometrically thick flows and as a result the mass accretion
rate in the innermost region of the flow will reflect modulations of the mass
accretion rate added to the flow at any distance from the black hole. Therefore
if primary instabilities operate on the short time scales then the stability of
the soft component (originating from the geometrically thin and optically thick
flow) and variability of the hard component (coming from the geometrically
thick and optically thin flow) are naturally explained.

agree to the values obtained by the Extragalactic Distance Scale Key Project on
the basis of empirical Period-Luminosity relations referenced to LMC variables.
In the meantime, from the theoretical relations with Z=0.004 and 0.02 we find
that the predicted E(B-V) and mu_0 decrease as the adopted metal content
increases. This suggests a metallicity correction to LMC-based distances as
given by about -0.27 mag/dex. Such a theoretical correction appears supported
by an existing, although weak, correlation between the Cepheid distance and the
[O/H] metallicity of galaxies within a given group or cluster, as well as by a
similar correlation between the H_0 estimate and the [O/H] metallicity of the

typical of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids (Y=0.25, Z=0.008) and stellar
masses ranging from 6.55 to 7.45 solar masses. We find that theoretical light
and velocity curves reproduce the HP, and indeed close to the blue edge the
bump is located along the descending branch, toward longer periods it crosses
at first the luminosity/velocity maximum and then it appears along the rising
branch. In particular, we find that the predicted period at the HP center is
11.24 +- 0.46 d and that such a value is in very good agreement with the
empirical value estimated by adopting the Fourier parameters of LMC Cepheid
light curves. We also find that the models at the HP center are located within
the resonance region but not on the 2:1 resonance line. Interestingly enough,
the predicted Bump Cepheid masses, based on a Mass-Luminosity (ML) relation
which neglects the convective core overshooting, are in good agreement with the
empirical masses of Galactic Cepheids estimated by adopting the Baade-Wesselink
method. Even by accounting for the metallicity difference between Galactic and
LMC Cepheids, this result seems to settle down the long-standing problem of the
Bump mass discrepancy. Finally, the dynamical behavior of a cool Bump Cepheid

been investigated without including scalar field to show that an averaged scale
factor coincides with that of the Friedmann model. In this work we construct
the inhomogeneous universe with an massless scalar field, where we assume that
the averaged scale factor and scalar field are given by those of the Friedmann
model including a scalar field. All of our calculations are carried out in the
framework of Brans-Dicke gravity. In constructing the model of an inhomogeneous
universe, we define the mass of a black hole in the Brans-Dicke expanding
universe which is equivalent to ADM mass if the mass evolves adiabatically, and
obtain an equation relating our mass to the averaged scalar field and scale
factor. As the results we find that the mass has an adiabatic time dependence
in a sufficiently late stage of the expansion of the universe, and that the
time dependence is qualitatively diffenrent according to the sign of the
curvature of the universe: the mass increases decelerating in the closed
universe case, is constant in the flat case and decreases decelerating in the
open case. It is also noted that the mass in the Einstein frame depends on
time. Our results that the mass has a time dependence should be retained even
in the general scalar-tensor gravitiy with a scalar field potential.
Furthermore, we discuss the relation of our results to the uniqueness theorem
of black hole spacetime and gravitational memory effect.

that an extended N = 2 supersymmetry survives to low energies, as suggested by
various constructions. We examine the phenomenological viability and
implications of such a scenario. We show that consistent chiral fermion mass
generation emerges in N=2 theories, which are vectorial, as a result of
supersymmetry breaking at low energies. A rich mirror quark and lepton spectrum
near the weak scale with model-dependent decay modes is predicted. A Z_{2}
mirror parity is shown to play an important role in determining the
phenomenology of the models. It leads, if conserved, to a new stable particle,
the LMP. Consistency of the N=2 framework and its unique spectrum with
electroweak precision data is considered, and the discovery potential in the
next generation of hadron collider experiments is stressed. Mirror quark pair
production provides the most promising discovery channel. Higgs searches are
also discussed and it is shown that there is no upper bound on the prediction
for the Higgs boson mass in the framework of low-energy supersymmetry breaking,

The starting point in this study is a rigorous general expression for the
internal energy of a system of noninteracting oscillators in terms of the sum
over the Matsubara frequencies. Summation over the angular momentum values is
accomplished in a closed form by making use of the addition theorem for the
relevant Bessel functions. For removing the divergences the renormalization
procedure is applied that has been developed in the calculation of the
corresponding Casimir energy at zero temperature. The behavior of the
thermodynamic characteristics in the low and high temperature limits is
investigated.

Karman equations themselves. They are used to define acceleration waves in thin
isotropic elastic plates as discontinuity solutions with finite jumps of second
derivatives of the displacement field at a certain curve - the wave front.
These two balance laws lead through Hadamard's lemma and Kotchin's theorem to a
set of jump conditions on the wave front. Similarly, the other balance laws
lead to additional and independent jump conditions on the curve of
discontinuity. Several examples are given to illustrate the effect of involving
jump conditions of that kind in analysis of acceleration waves in plates. The
examples are composed on the basis of three families of group-invariant
solutions to the time-dependent von Karman equations. They present three kinds
of waveforms pertaining to the class of the so-called relatively undistorded
progressive waves. We analyze the propagation of this special kind of
acceleration waves into a known state of plate motion.

standard axioms of local quantum physics. We also give a group theoretical

invariants in conformal field theory and braided subfactors in operator
algebras. A subfactor with a braiding determines a matrix $Z$ which is obtained
as a coupling matrix comparing two kinds of braided sector induction
(""alpha-induction""). It has non-negative integer entries, is normalized and
commutes with the S- and T-matrices arising from the braiding. Thus it is a
physical modular invariant in the usual sense of rational conformal field
theory. The algebraic treatment of conformal field theory models, e.g.
$SU(n)_k$ models, produces subfactors which realize their known modular
invariants. Several properties of modular invariants have so far been noticed
empirically and considered mysterious such as their intimate relationship to
graphs, as for example the A-D-E classification for $SU(2)_k$. In the subfactor
context these properties can be rigorously derived in a very general setting.
Moreover the fusion rule isomorphism for maximally extended chiral algebras due
to Moore-Seiberg, Dijkgraaf-Verlinde finds a clear and very general proof and
interpretation through intermediate subfactors, not even referring to
modularity of $S$ and $T$. Finally we give an overview on the current state of
affairs concerning the relations between the classifications of braided
subfactors and two-dimensional conformal field theories. We demonstrate in
particular how to realize twisted (type II) descendant modular invariants of
conformal inclusions from subfactors and illustrate the method by new examples.

ignition-type nonlinearity and discuss the following question: What kinds of
velocity profiles are capable of quenching any given flame, provided the
velocity's amplitude is adequately large? Even for shear flows, the answer
turns out to be surprisingly subtle. If the velocity profile changes in space
so that it is nowhere identically constant, (or if it is identically constant
only in a region of small measure) then the flow can quench any initial data.
But if the velocity profile is identically constant in a sizable region, then
the ensuing flow is incapable of quenching large enough flames, no matter how
much larger is the amplitude of this velocity. The constancy region must be
wider across than a couple of laminar propagating front-widths. The proof uses
a linear PDE associated to the nonlinear problem and quenching follows when the
PDE is hypoelliptic. The techniques used allow the derivation of new, nearly
optimal bounds on the speed of traveling wave solutions.

phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external

melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability.
The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined.
In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum
computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is
exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer
eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result
the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against
imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization
of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of
