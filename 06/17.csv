background (2-10 keV), and have also been proposed as the powerhouse of a
fraction of the SCUBA sources which make most of the background at 850um, thus
providing a link between the two spectral windows. We have tackled this issue
by comparing data at 2-10 keV and at 850um for a sample of 34 sources at fluxes
(or limiting fluxes) which resolve most of the background in the two bands. We
present here new SCUBA observations, and new correlations between separate data
sets retrieved from the literature. Similar correlations presented by others
are added for completeness. None of the 11 hard X-ray (2-10 keV) sources has a
counterpart at 850um, with the exception of a Chandra source in the SSA13
field, which is a candidate type 2, heavily absorbed QSO at high redshift. The
ratios F(850um)/F(5keV) (mostly upper limits) of the X-ray sources are
significantly lower than the value observed for the cosmic background. In
particular, we obtain that 2-10 keV sources brighter than 10^-15 erg s^-1
cm^-2, which make at least 75% of the background in this band, contribute for
less than 7% to the submillimeter background. Out of the 24 SCUBA sources, 23
are undetected by Chandra. The ratios F(850um)/F(5keV) (mostly lower limits) of
these SCUBA sources indicate that most of them must be powered either by
starburst activity, or by an AGN which is obscured by a column Nh > 10^25
cm^-2, with a reflection efficiency in the hard X rays significantly lower than
1% in most cases. However, AGNs of this type could not contribute significantly
to the 2-10 keV background.

assumptions on the emission mechanism in GRBs are formulated. It is found that
the observed radiation in sub-MeV energy range is generated by the synchrotron
emission mechanism, though about ten per cent of the total GRB energy should be
converted via the inverse Compton process into ultra-hard spectral domain
(above 100 GeV). We estimate the magnetic field strength in the emitting
region, the Lorentz factor of accelerated electrons, and the typical energy of
IC photons.
  We show that there is a ""line-of-death"" relation for GRBs and derive from
this relation the lower limits on both GRB duration and GRB variability
timescale. The upper limit on the Lorentz factor of GRB fireballs is also
found. We demonstrate that steady-state electron distribution consistent with
the Compton losses may produce different spectral indices, e.g., 3/4 as opposed
to the figure 1/2 widely discussed in the literature. It is suggested that the
changes in the decline rate observed in the lightcurves of several GRB
afterglows may be due to the time evolution of spectral break, which appears in
the synchrotron emission generated by steady-state self-consistent electron
distribution.

several implications for the properties of both for open-system energy density
functionals and the integer-state functionals describing the microscopic
states. The first is that each integer-state energy density functional is a
functional of the original type discovered by Levy. Another is that the
dependence of the open-system functional on the ensemble density is linear
whereas the dependence of the integer-state functional is decidedly nonlinear.
Finally, the derivative discontinuity behavior with respect to particle number
of some open-system density functionals appears to be connected to the
long-range behavior of the effective external potentials of the integer-state
functionals governing the interactions among subsystems in the ensemble.

(supersymmetric) grand unified theories due to copious monopole production at
the end of hybrid inflation. By employing thermal inflation ``driven'' by the
U(1) axion symmetry, the superheavy monopole flux can be naturally suppressed
to values that should be accessible to dedicated large scale experiments. The
U(1) axion symmetry also helps generate the right magnitude for the mu term of
the minimal supersymmetric standard model. An important by-product is the
predicted existence of stable or very long-living fermions possessing
intermediate scale masses of order 10^{12} GeV. Their presence is required for
implementing thermal inflation, and their stability is due to a Z_2 symmetry.
They may constitute a sizable fraction of cold dark matter, and possibly help
explain the ultra-high energy cosmic ray events. The rest of cold dark matter
may consist of axions. Although our discussion is carried out within the
framework of supersymmetric SU(4)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R, it can be extended to
other grand unified gauge groups such as SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R or SO(10).

suggested that BR scaling gives the background around which the fluctuations
are weak. A simple model with BR-scaled parameters is constructed and
reproduces the properties of the nuclear ground state at normal nuclear matter
density successfully. It shows that the tree level in the model Lagrangian is
enough to describe the fluctuations around BR-scaled background. The model
Lagrangian is consistent thermodynamically and reproduces relativistic Landau
Fermi-liquid properties. Such points are important for dealing with hadronic
matter under extreme condition. On the other hand it is shown that the vector
current obtained from the chiral Lagrangian is the same as that obtained from
Landau-Migdal approach. We can determine the Landau parameter in terms of
BR-scaled parameter. However these two approaches provide different results,

nuclear binding systematics. Up to now, microscopic theory has been less
successful than models starting from the liquid drop in describing accurately
the global binding systematics. We believe that there are good prospects to
develop a better global theory, using modern forms of energy density
functionals and treating correlation energies systematically by the RPA.

for the first time in the framework of the cranked relativistic mean field
theory. It is shown that nuclear magnetism modifies the expectation values of
single-particle spin, orbital and total angular momenta along the rotational
axis effectively creating additional angular momentum. This effect leads to the
increase of kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia at given rotational
frequency and has an impact on effective alignments.

(hep-ex/0001012). A case in point is the mass of the Truth Quark. The consensus
analysis of the experimental data indicates that the mass of the Truth Quark is
about 170 GeV. On the other hand, an alternative analysis of the same data
indicates that the mass of the Truth Quark is about 130 GeV. If the design of
future experiments, including trigger, event selection, data analysis
procedures, error analysis, etc., takes into account only the consensus value,
and if the consensus value happens to be incorrect, then results of future
experiments might be compromised.
