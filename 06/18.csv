  Journal, Nov. 10, 2000 issue",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present results from three-dimensional (3-D) numerical simulations
investigating the magnetohydrodynamics of cloud-wind interactions. The initial
cloud is spherical while the magnetic field is uniform and transverse to the
cloud motion. A simplified analytical model that describes the magnetic energy
evolution in front of the cloud is developed and compared with simulation
results. In addition, it is found the interaction of the cloud with a
magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) results in the formation of a highly
structured magnetotail. The magnetic flux in the wake of the cloud organizes
into flux ropes and a reconnection, current sheet is developed, as field lines
of opposite polarity are brought close together near the symmetry axis. At the
same time, magnetic pressure is strongly enhanced at the leading edge of the
cloud from the stretching of the field lines that occurs there. This has an
important dynamical effect on the subsequent evolution of the cloud, since some
unstable modes tend to be strongly enhanced.

transport term used in simple analytic accretion disc modeling, a pseudoscalar
transport term also arises. The essence of this term can be captured even in
simple models for which vertical averaging is interpreted as integration over a
half-thickness and one separately studies each hemisphere. The additional term
highlights a complementarity between mean field magnetic dynamo theory and
accretion disc theory treated as a mean field theory. Such pseudoscalar terms
have been studied, and can lead to large scale magnetic field and vorticity
growth. Here it is shown that vorticity can grow even in the simplest azimuthal
and half-height integrated disc model, for which mean quantities depend only on
radius. The simplest vorticity growth solutions seem to have scales and vortex
survival times consistent those required for facilitating planet formation.
Also it is shown that when the magnetic back-reaction is included to lowest
order, the pseudoscalar driving the magnetic field growth and that driving the
vorticity growth will behave differently with respect to shearing and
non-shearing flows: the former can reverse sign in the two cases, while the
latter will have the same sign.

  Minor corrections and fixed typos",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We present a derivation of the stress field for an interacting quantum system
within the framework of local density functional theory. The formulation is
geometric in nature and exploits the relationship between the strain tensor
field and Riemannian metric tensor field. The resultant expression obtained for
the stress field is gauge-invariant with respect to choice of energy density,
and therefore provides a unique, well-defined quantity. To illustrate this
formalism, we compute the pressure field for two phases of solid molecular
hydrogen.

complexity of the Internet has complicated network protocol design and
evaluation.
  In this paper, we present a method for automatic synthesis of worst and best
case scenarios for multipoint protocol performance evaluation.
  Our method uses a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for
searching the protocol and system state space to synthesize these scenarios.
The algorithm is based on a global finite state machine (FSM) model. We extend
the algorithm with timing semantics to handle end-to-end delays and address
performance criteria. We introduce the notion of a virtual LAN to represent
delays of the underlying multicast distribution tree.
  As a case study, we use our method to evaluate variants of the timer
suppression mechanism, used in various multipoint protocols, with respect to
two performance criteria: overhead of response messages and response time.
Simulation results for reliable multicast protocols show that our method
provides a scalable way for synthesizing worst-case scenarios automatically. We
expect our method to serve as a model for applying systematic scenario
generation to other multipoint protocols.

expansion of the theory of weak interactions works at the tree level, i.e. the
model of dynamical analogy of Cabibbo-Kobayashi- Maskawa matrices and its
further development, are given. It is shown that the quarks and massive vector
bosons must be structural and these structural particles (subparticles) must
interact to generate quark and vector boson masses. In this case the problem of
singularity cancellations does not arise in this model. It is also shown that,
for self consistency of the theory, the weak decays of $K$ mesons must go
through massive vector boson $B$ but not $W$ boson. In the framework of this
model the probability of $\pi \leftrightarrow K$ transitions (oscillations) in
the diagram approach is computed. These transitions are virtual since masses of
$\pi$ and $K$ mesons differ considerably. These transitions (oscillations) can
be registered through $K$ decays after transitions of virtual $K$ mesons to
their own mass shell by using their quasielastic strong interactions.

anti-self-dual solutions have representations in terms of minimal surfaces. The
issue of topological charge is quite subtle because the surfaces that appear
are non-compact. This minimal surface/instanton correspondence allows us to
define a metric on the configuration space of the gauge fields. We obtain the
minimal surface representation of an instanton with arbitrary charge. The
trivial vacuum and the BPST instanton as minimal surfaces are worked out in
detail. BPS monopoles and the geodesics are also discussed.
