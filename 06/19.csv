D62 (2000) 084030","10.1103/PhysRevD.62.084030",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  The presence of a viscous boundary layer under the solid crust of a neutron
star dramatically increases the viscous damping rate of the fluid r-modes. We
improve previous estimates of this damping rate by including the effect of the
Coriolis force on the boundary-layer eigenfunction and by using more realistic
neutron-star models. If the crust is assumed to be perfectly rigid, the
gravitational radiation driven instability in the r-modes is completely
suppressed in neutron stars colder than about 1.5 x 10^8 K. Energy generation
in the boundary layer will heat the star, and will even melt the crust if the
amplitude of the r-mode is large enough. We solve the heat equation explicitly
(including the effects of thermal conduction and neutrino emission) and find
that the r-mode amplitude needed to melt the crust is approximately a_c = 5 x
10^{-3} for maximally rotating neutron stars. If the r-mode saturates at an
amplitude larger than a_c, the heat generated is sufficient to maintain the
outer layers of the star in a mixed fluid-solid state analogous to the pack ice
on the fringes of the Arctic Ocean. We argue that in young, rapidly rotating
neutron stars this effect considerably delays the formation of the crust. By
considering the dissipation in the ice flow, we show that the final spin
frequency of stars with r-mode amplitude of order unity is close to the value
estimated for fluid stars without a crust.

properties comparable to those of isolated non active spirals. Central colors

birefringence, $\Delta n$, and the orientation angle, $\chi$, of the optic axes
in the solution and thereby the generalized viscosity function, $\eta$ (with
the use of stress-optical relations). The DLS method was applied to measure the
velocity-gradient, \gdot, and the flow-type parameter $\lambda$ for the polymer
solutions under flow conditions identical to the TCFB measurements. For low
deformation rates the symmetry of the flow-field was reduced with the use of
polymeric fluids compared to that seen with a Newtonian fluid. A molecular

chain-stretching effects, has been used to numerically simulate the predictions

dWHN-BFSS matrix models. Here we find new compactifications of this theory
whose Hilbert spaces consist of SU(16) conformal blocks on compact

preserve the SU(N) but break SU(16) to the SO(9) symmetry of the 11 dimensional

when temperature of Universe become low enough and symmetry broke. Are there
another sources of rest masses that are consequences of other nature of rest
masses or it is the only methods for generating rest masses? What will be with
massless fields when the laws of symmetry are not exact laws but only are very
good approximation and the time is not homogeneous, as it is in the fractal
world? In this paper based on the fractal theory of time and space (developed
by author earlier) a possible source of rest masses caused by the fractional
dimensions (FD) of the time is considered. It gives rest masses (very small)
for all particles and fields including gravitational and electromagnetic
fields. The estimation of the values of the rest masses gives
$m_{g}=\sqrt{\epsilon (tt_{i})^{-1}}$, $m_{f}= \sqrt{(t_{0}t_{i})^{-1}}$ where
$t_{i}$ is the necessary time for photons and gravitons with rest masses
$m_{ph}$ and $m_{g}$ to get the velocity equal the speed of light (in the
fractal Universe the moving with any velocities is possible), $t_{0}$ is the
time of existence of Universe. Under some assumption preliminary values of rest
masses photons and gravitons are obtained: for a rest mass of photons $
m_{f}\sim 10^{-39}g$, for a rest mass of gravitons $m_{g}\sim10^{-43}g$.

assignment variables and exact rotation/translation of atomic coordinates is
performed, weighted with the corresponding assignment variables. The approach
allows for extensive search of all possible alignments, including those
involving arbitrary permutations. The algorithm is implemented using a C_alpha
representation of the backbone and explored on different protein structure
categories using the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and is successfully compared with
other algorithms. The approach performs very well with modest CPU consumption
and is robust with respect to choice of parameters. It is extremely generic and
flexible and can handle additional user-prescribed constraints easily.
Furthermore, it allows for a probabilistic interpretation of the results.

self-adjoint T, and is satisfied by the Aharonov-Bohm time operator T_0 and the
free Hamiltonian H_0 for the one-dimensional free-particle system. In order to
see the qualitative properties of T_0, the operators T and H satisfying this

deviation of T is directly connected to the survival probability, and H is
absolutely continuous. Hence, it is concluded that the existence of the

the minimum uncertainty states do not exist. Other examples of these operators
