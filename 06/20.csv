region (PDR) associated with the reflection nebula NGC 2023. Using the VLA,
continuum emission is detected at 8.6 GHz from a faint HII region associated
with HD 37903. The C91a emission originates from a 0.4 pc long filament,
extending from the east to the south of the exciting star HD 37903. Within the
filament three C91a clumps can be distinguished, each associated with
filamentary vibrationally excited H2 emission in the direction toward HD 37903.
The HCO+ emission has a clumpy appearance superimposed on a more extended
component. C91a is, in general, closer to the exciting star than HCO+ emission
as expected from PDR models. The morphologies of HCO+ and HCN are quite
similar. Based on the C91a linewidth towards one of the clumps a limit of 170 K
on the kinetic temperature in the ionized carbon layer can be derived. This
value is consistent with PDR models with H2 densities of about 10^5/cm^3.
However, this result suggests surprisingly low limits on the turbulence in the
PDR. We detected a compact 3 mm continuum source in the PDR, which appears to
be a cold ""core"" of density 10^7/cm^3, 0.03 parsec diameter, and 6 solar
masses. We conclude that it may have formed within the PDR. In an appendix,

1993J are clumpy. On the other hand, a lack of structure in emission lines of
calcium implies that the source of calcium emission is uniformly distributed

emission originates in clumpy, newly synthesized material, while calcium
emission arises from material pre-existing in the atmosphere of the progenitor.
Spectra spanning the range 433-2454 days after the explosion show box-like
profiles for the emission lines, clearly indicating circumstellar interaction
in a roughly spherical shell. This is interpreted within the Chevalier &
Fransson (1994) model for SNe interacting with mass lost during prior stellar
winds. At very late times, the emission lines have a two-horned profile,
implying the formation of a somewhat flattened or disk-like structure that is a
significant source of emission. The very high signal-to-noise ratio spectra are
used to demonstrate the potential significance of misinterpretation of telluric

emission lines in the spectrum of both black hole candidates and active
galactic nuclei. These lines are likely to originate from relativistic outflows
(or jets) in the vicinity of the central black hole. Consequently, the profile
of such a line should be distorted by strong gravitational effects near the
black hole, as well as special relativistic effects. In this paper, we present
results from a detailed study on how each process affects the observed line
profile. We found that the profile is sensitive to the intrinsic properties of
the jets (Lorentz factor, velocity profile, and emissivity law), as well as to
the spin of the black hole and the viewing angle (with respect to the axis of
the jets). More specifically, in the case of approaching jets, an intrisically
narrow line (blue-shifted) is seen as simply broadened at small viewing angles,
but it shows a doubly peaked profile at large viewing angles for extreme Kerr
black holes (due to the combination of gravitational focusing and Doppler
effects); the profile is always singly peaked for Schwarzschild black holes.
For receding jets, however, the line profile becomes quite complicated owing to
complicated photon trajectories. To facilitate comparison with observations, we
searched a large parameter space to derive representative line profiles. We
show the results and discuss how to use emission lines as a potential tool for
probing the inner region of a black hole jet system.

describing the general method, we apply the formalism to a series of
statistics, including genus statistics, level-crossing statistics, Minkowski

theory. In CDM-like models, their functional deviations from linear predictions
plotted against the rescaled threshold are generally much smaller than that

hydrogen component of the intergalactic medium (IGM) must have been reionized
at some redshift z>6. Prior to complete reionization, sources of ultraviolet
radiation will be seen behind intervening gas that is still neutral, and their
spectra should show the red damping wing of the Gunn-Peterson trough. While
this characteristic feature may, in principle, totally suppress the
Lyman-alphaa emission line in the spectra of the first generation of objects in
the universe, we show here that the IGM in the vicinity of luminous quasars
will be highly photoionized on several Mpc scales due to the source emission of
Lyman-continuum photons. If the quasar lifetime is shorter than the expansion
and gas recombination timescales, the volume ionized will be proportional to
the total number of photons produced above 13.6 eV: the effect of this local
photoionization is to greatly reduce the scattering opacity between the
redshift of the quasar and the boundary of its HII region. We find that the
transmission on the red side of the Lyman-alpha resonance is always greater
than 50% for sources radiating a total of 1e69.5 ionizing photons into the IGM.
The detection of a strong Lyman-alpha emission line in the spectra of bright
QSOs shining for >1e7 yr cannot then be used, by itself, as a constraint on the
reionization epoch. The first signs of an object radiating prior to the
transition from a neutral to an ionized universe may be best searched for in

galaxies. The halo angular momentum required to avoid strong braking is
unrealistically large, even when rotation is confined to the inner halo only.
We conclude, therefore, that bars are able to maintain their observed high
pattern speeds only if the halo has a central density low enough for the disk

infrared wavelengths to within our time resolution (<4 min), consistent with
the respective emitting regions being physically close near the base of the
outflow. One infrared event appears to have no mm counterpart, perhaps due to
highly variable absorption. The overall radio-mm-infrared spectrum around the
time of the observations does suggest some absorption at lower frequencies. We
calculate the energy and mass-flow into the outflow for a number of different
assumptions, and find that the time-averaged power required to produce the
observed synchrotron emission cannot be much less than 3e38 erg/s, and is
likely to be much larger. This minimum power requirement is found regardless of
whether the observed emission arises in discrete ejections or in an internal

that experienced by sources located closest to the minor axes,
$<\gamma>_{minor}$. We also compute the degree to which the anisotropy in the

of coupled oscillators in the optical rotatory dispersion of the crystals. We
solve the problem using the Chandrasekhar model of two coupled oscillators in
the case when we include all couplings between adjacent oscillators on the
helix that is given by the crystal structure. Further we discuss the results of
coupled oscillators models in the case of the including of the couplings
between even and odd oscillators on the helix. The optical rotatory dispersion
results obtained after the approximations of the oscillator strengths verify
that these couplings have the important influence on the crystal optical

amplitudes and the corresponding strong phases could be extracted from a global
$\chi^2$ fit of the experimental data. We emphasize that in general there are
two, rather than one, relative strong phases in the decomposition. In the
assumption of two equalstrong phases as considered in the literature, the
current data, especially the ones concerning $B\to \pi^0 K^{0(\pm)}$decays,
will imply a large isospin amplitude $|a^c_{3/2}| > 40 $, which is larger by a
factor of five than the one from the naive factorization estimation. When two
different strong phases are considered, all the isospin amplitudes can become,
within the $1\sigma$-level, comparable with the theoretical values. We also
show that the difference between the two strong phases cannot be too large and
will be restricted by the most recent upper bound of $B\to \pi^0\pi^0$ decay.
In any case, the strong phases are found to be large and the branching ratio of
$B\to \pi^0\pi^0$ is likely to be enhanced by an order of magnitude in
comparison with the one obtained from the naive factorization approach. Direct

Irrespective of this problem, we then study an isolated class of flat solutions

integrals on a quotient space Q=M/G and that the reduced path integrals are
completely classified by irreducible unitary representations of G. It is not
necessary to assume that the action of G on M is either free or transitive.
Hence our formulation is applicable to a wide class of manifolds, which
includes inhomogeneous spaces, and it covers all the inequivalent
quantizations. To describe the path integral on inhomogeneous space,
stratification geometry, which is a generalization of the concept of principal
fiber bundle, is necessarily introduced. Using it we show that the path
integral is expressed as a product of three factors; the rotational energy
amplitude, the vibrational energy amplitude, and the holonomy factor. When a
singular point arises in $ Q $, we determine the boundary condition of the path
integral kernel for a path which runs through the singularity.

represents a variant of the minimum-phase property for general smooth nonlinear
control systems. The definition of output-input stability does not rely on a
particular choice of coordinates in which the system takes a normal form or on
the computation of zero dynamics. In the spirit of the ``input-to-state
stability'' philosophy, it requires the state and the input of the system to be
bounded by a suitable function of the output and derivatives of the output,
modulo a decaying term depending on initial conditions. The class of
output-input stable systems thus defined includes all affine systems in global
normal form whose internal dynamics are input-to-state stable and also all
left-invertible linear systems whose transmission zeros have negative real
parts. As an application, we explain how the new concept enables one to develop
a natural extension to nonlinear systems of a basic result from linear adaptive
control.

extended to the cases beyond the SU(2) orbital symmetry. Using parameters fixed
by baryon properties and $NN$ scattering, we find a mild attraction in the
$IJ^P=00^-$ channel, but it is not strong enough to form a deeply bound state
as proposed for the $d'$ state. Nor does the (isospin) I=2 N$\Delta$
configuration have a deeply bound state. These results show that if a narrow
dibaryon $d'$ state does exist, it must have a more complicated structure.

Our analysis clearly shows the necessity of measurements of $\lambda$, the
ratio of axial/vector couplings. The current situation in neutron beta decay is
that one cannot yet quote a single consistent value for $|V_{ud}|$ from it. We
also discuss the region of parameter space in the $|V_{ud}|$--$\lambda$ plane
where new physics effects should lie, if they contribute to neutron beta decay.

an isolated vortex in superconducting quark matter. We obtain a solution for

information about the off-shell nucleon-nucleon amplitude which would allow one
to distinguish among nucleon-nucleon potentials based on their off-shell
properties. There have been many calculations and many experiments devoted to
this aim. We show here, in contrast to this standard view, that such off-shell
amplitudes are not measurable as a matter of principle. This follows formally
from the invariance of the S-matrix under transformations of the fields. This
result is discussed here and illustrated via two simple models, one applying to
spin zero, and one to spin one half, processes. The latter model is very
closely related to phenomenological models which have been used to study
off-shell effects at electromagnetic vertices.

evidence for clustering of matter on spatial scales beyond 100 Mpc, which is
beyond the distance at which clustering of matter is now generally accepted to

that the Higgs cannot be a physical particle. Higgs is the underlying `vacuum'
over which the whole edifice of the Standard Model stands. Also on most general
grounds it is established here that as per the Standard Model there is no
electric charge above the electro-weak phase transition temperature. Hence
there was no electric charge present in the Early Universe. The Superstring

conceptual difficulties arise when we try to define the information gain in a

that, in contrast to classical measurement, quantum measurement, with very few
