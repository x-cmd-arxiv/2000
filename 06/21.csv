Deep Field. One of the survey regions is configured so that some galaxy pairs
span angular separations of up to 1 deg. The median redshift is $z_{med}\approx
0.55$. Strong clustering is obvious, with every pencil-beam field containing a
handful of narrow redshift-space features, corresponding to galaxy structures
with sizes of 5 to 20 Mpc. The structures are not obviously organized on
planes, though one prominent, colinear triplet of structures is observed,
spanning $\sim 20$ Mpc. This may be evidence of a filament. A galaxy--galaxy
correlation function calculation is performed. No significant evolution of
clustering (relative to stable clustering) is found in the redshift range
0.3<z<1.0. This is not surprising, since uncertainties in the correlation
amplitude estimated from surveys like these are large; field-to-field
variations and covariances between data points are both shown to be
significant. Consistent with other studies in this redshift range, the
galaxy--galaxy correlation length is found to be somewhat smaller than that
predicted from local measurements and an assumption of no evolution. Galaxies
with absorption-line-dominated spectra show much stronger clustering at
distances of <2 Mpc than typical field galaxies. There is some evidence for
weaker clustering at intermediate redshift than at low redshift, when the
results presented here are compared with surveys of the local Universe. In
subsets of the data, the measured pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies
ranges from 200 to $600 km s^{-1}$, depending on the properties of the dominant
redshift structures in each subset.

curve, yet samples are too numerous to examine each galaxy in detail.
Therefore, one goal of rotation curve measurement techniques is to flag cases
in which the kinematic structure of the galaxy is more complex than a
single-valued curve.
  We examine cross-correlation as a technique that is easily automated and
works for low signal-to-noise spectra. We show that the technique yields
well-defined errors which increase when the simple spectral model (template) is
a poor match to the data, flagging those cases for later inspection.
  We compare the technique to the more traditional, parametric technique of
simultaneous emission line fitting. When the line profile at a single slit
position is non-Gaussian, the techniques disagree. For our model spectra with
two well-separated velocity components, assigned velocities from the two
techniques differ by up to ~52% of the velocity separation of the model
components. However, careful use of the error statistics for either technique
allows one to flag these non-Gaussian spectra.

there are strong biases against the discovery of peculiar SNe Ia introduced by
at least four observational effects: the Malmquist bias, the age of the SN Ia
at the time of its discovery, the shape of its light curve, and its degree of
extinction. Surveys with low observation frequency (less than once per 10 days)
tend to discover SNe Ia which are too old for observers to easily recognize
their peculi arity. Subluminous SNe Ia are underrepresented in
magnitude-limited surveys because they can only be found within a small volume
and they remain above the detection limit for less time. Conversely,
overluminous SNe Ia are more easily found in magnitude-limited surveys although
their likely association with dusty regions reduces the volume in which they
can be discovered. The unbiased rate of peculiar SNe Ia can be recovered only
in distance-limited surveys with high observation frequencies and with
detection limits which are fainter than the peak magnitude of a subluminous SN

better than previous limits. In terms of the constant $\xi $ of non-minimally

rest-frame integrated color of the host galaxies is on average R-H=2.3+-0.3,

$a$ is the lattice constant, and henceforth will be set to 1) can
simultaneously reproduces the always existing IC peaks in the superconducting

frequency change. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO), a moderate $\Delta(0)/v_F
a$ and proximity of the van Hove singularity (vHS) at ${\bar M}=(0,\pi)$ to the
Fermi level can reproduce the frequency- and temperature-driven shifting IC
peaks in the SC state, and the vanishing of the IC peak in the normal state.
The commensurate peak is found to be more appropriately described as a random
phase approximation (RPA) effect. We address the conditional peak shifting
behavior to a refined consideration on the nesting effect which is previously
overlook. As a result, both the data on LSCO and the recent data on YBCO (on

  covering finite-connectivity random graphs","24 pages, 9 figures","Theoretical Computer Science 265, 199 (2001)",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cs.CC",,"  The vertex-cover problem is studied for random graphs $G_{N,cN}$ having $N$
vertices and $cN$ edges. Exact numerical results are obtained by a
branch-and-bound algorithm. It is found that a transition in the coverability
at a $c$-dependent threshold $x=x_c(c)$ appears, where $xN$ is the cardinality
of the vertex cover. This transition coincides with a sharp peak of the typical
numerical effort, which is needed to decide whether there exists a cover with
$xN$ vertices or not. For small edge concentrations $c\ll 0.5$, a cluster
expansion is performed, giving very accurate results in this regime. These
results are extended using methods developed in statistical physics. The so
called annealed approximation reproduces a rigorous bound on $x_c(c)$ which was
known previously. The main part of the paper contains an application of the
replica method. Within the replica symmetric ansatz the threshold $x_c(c)$ and
the critical backbone size $b_c(c)$ can be calculated. For $c<e/2$ the results
show an excellent agreement with the numerical findings. At average vertex
degree $2c=e$, an instability of the simple replica symmetric solution occurs.

two distinct coexisting energy gaps near optimum doping and in the overdoped

studies of QP recombination as a function of doping and temperature suggest
that the ground state of the cuprates is a mixed Boson-Fermion system with

parameter expected to be a few orders of magnitude above the Planck length. The
curvature-dependent effective gravitational constant defined by dL/dR = 1/16 pi
G_eff is G_eff = G \sqrt{1+l^4 R^2}^{3}, and tends to infinity for large $R$,
in contrast to most other approaches where G_eff-> 0. The theory possesses
neither ghosts nor tachyons. In a curvature-saturated cosmology, the
coordinates with ds^2 = a^2 [da^2/B(a) - dx^2 - dy^2- dz^2] are most convenient
since the curvature scalar becomes a linear function of $B(a)$. Solutions with
a big-bang singularity have a much milder behavior of the curvature than in
Einstein's theory. In synchronized time, the metric is given by ds^2 = dt^2 -
t^{6/5(dx^2 + dy^2+ dz^2). On the technical side we show that two different
conformal transformations make L_cs asymptotically equivalent to the

a composite of top quarks, having the quantum numbers of the Higgs doublet and

trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. The mass of the top quark is correctly
predicted to within 20%, without the need to add a fundamental Yukawa

one hand, a deep and natural generalisation of symmetry groups for certain
integrable systems, and on the other as part of a generalisation of geometry
itself powerful enough to make sense in the quantum domain. Just as the last
century saw the birth of classical geometry, so the present century sees at its
end the birth of this quantum or noncommutative geometry, both as an elegant
mathematical reality and in the form of the first theoretical predictions for
Planck-scale physics via ongoing astronomical measurements. Noncommutativity of
spacetime, in particular, amounts to a postulated new force or physical effect

procedure with respect to a \v{C}ech resolution of any covering map of a

associated to the base-point Riemann surface. From it, we obtain a variational
characterization of Hubbard's universal family of projective structures,

  with Gauss Heat Bath","21 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1134/1.1348475",,"nlin.CD cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Large entropy fluctuations in a nonequilibrium steady state of classical
mechanics were studied in extensive numerical experiments on a simple 2-freedom
model with the so-called Gauss time-reversible thermostat. The local
fluctuations (on a set of fixed trajectory segments) from the average heat
entropy absorbed in thermostat were found to be non-Gaussian. Approximately,
the fluctuations can be discribed by a two-Gaussian distribution with a
crossover independent of the segment length and the number of trajectories
('particles'). The distribution itself does depend on both, approaching the
single standard Gaussian distribution as any of those parameters increases. The
global time-dependent fluctuations turned out to be qualitatively different in
that they have a strict upper bound much less than the average entropy
production. Thus, unlike the equilibrium steady state, the recovery of the
initial low entropy becomes impossible, after a sufficiently long time, even in
the largest fluctuations. However, preliminary numerical experiments and the
theoretical estimates in the special case of the critical dynamics with
superdiffusion suggest the existence of infinitely many Poincar\'e recurrences
to the initial state and beyond. This is a new interesting phenomenon to be
farther studied together with some other open questions. Relation of this
particular example of nonequilibrium steady state to a long-standing persistent
controversy over statistical 'irreversibility', or the notorious 'time arrow',

chiral spin liquid states on the torus to construct quantum error correcting
codes is investigated. It is shown that codes constructed using these states on
finite periodic lattices do not meet the necessary and sufficient conditions
for correcting even a single qubit error with perfect fidelity. However, for
large enough lattice sizes these conditions are approximately satisfied, and
the resulting codes may therefore be viewed as approximate quantum error
correcting codes.

  quantum interference","RevTex 4 pages, 1 ps figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A solid state device to discriminate all the four Bell states is proposed.
The device is composed of controlled absorption crystals, rotators, and
retarders. The controlled absorption, where the state of one photon affects the
absorption of the other photon, is realized by two photon absorption in a cubic
crystal. The controlled absorption crystal detects a particular Bell state and
is transparent for the other Bell states. The rotators and retarders transform
a Bell state to another. This device may solve the problems in the early
quantum teleportation experiments in photon polarization states.

Lett. 86 (2001) 2699-2703","10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.2699",,"quant-ph",,"  The temporal evolution of an unstable quantum mechanical system undergoing
repeated measurements is investigated. In general, by changing the time
interval between successive measurements, the decay can be accelerated (inverse
quantum Zeno effect) or slowed down (quantum Zeno effect), depending on the
features of the interaction Hamiltonian. A geometric criterion is proposed for
a transition to occur between these two regimes.

coherently prepared in a dark state by continuous-wave low-intensity laser
radiation. Our experiment is performed in sodium vapor excited in $\Lambda $
configuration on the D$_{1}$ line by two laser fields of resonant frequencies
$\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, and probed by a third field $% \omega_{3}$.
First-order sidebands for frequencies $\omega_{1}$, $\omega_{2}$ and up to the
third-order sidebands for frequency $\omega_{3}$ are observed. The generation
starts at a power as low as 10 microwatt for each input field. Dependencies of
the intensities of both input and generated waves on the frequency difference
($\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}$), on the frequency $\omega_{3}$ and on the optical
density are investigated.
