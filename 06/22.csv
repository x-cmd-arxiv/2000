at the intersection of filaments in the plane of a cosmological pancake by
gravitational instability during pancake collapse. Such halos resemble the
virialized objects found in N-body simulations in a CDM universe and,
therefore, serve as a convenient, scale-free test-bed model for galaxy
formation. ASPH/P3M simulations reveal that such explosions are anisotropic.
The energy and metals are channeled into the low density regions, away from the
pancake plane. The pancake remains essentially undisturbed, even if the
explosion is strong enough to blow away all the gas located inside the halo at
the onset of the explosion and reheat the IGM surrounding the pancake. Infall
quickly replenishes this ejected gas and gradually restores the gas fraction as
the halo mass continues to grow. Estimates of the collapse epoch and SN
energy-release for galaxies of different mass in the CDM model can relate these
results to scale-dependent questions of blow-out and blow-away and their
implication for early IGM heating and metal enrichment and the creation of
dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.

  Pal 12's young age for a globular cluster led to the hypothesis that the
cluster originated in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and was later captured
by the Milky Way (Lin and Richer 1992). Here we investigate this hypothesis
using the complete kinematical data. We present the orbital characteristics of
Pal 12 and compare them with those of the LMC and Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
(Sgr). The present kinematical data suggest that, from the two parent
candidates for Pal 12, Sgr presents a more plausible case for the host galaxy
than the LMC.
  We explore this scenario in the context of the uncertainties in the orbits
and using two different analyses: the direct comparison of the orbits of Pal 12
and Sgr as a function of time, and the analytical model of Sgr's tidal
disruption developed by Johnson (1998). We find that, within the present
uncertainties of the observables, this scenario is viable in both methods.
Moreover, both methods place this event at the same point in time. Our best
estimate of the time of Pal 12's tidal capture from Sgr is ~ 1.7 Gyr ago.

leading order in 1/N diagrams for the quartic O(N) model. These two approaches
have the property that they preserve both boundedness and positivity for
expectation values of operators in our numerical simulations. These
approximations can be understood either in terms of a truncation to the
infinitely coupled Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy of equations, or by choosing a
particular two-particle irreducible vacuum energy graph in the effective action
of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism. We confine our discussion to the
case of quantum mechanics where the Lagrangian is $L(x,\dot{x}) = (1/2)
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{x}_i^2 - (g/8N) [ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 - r_0^2 ]^{2}$. The
key to these approximations is to treat both the $x$ propagator and the $x^2$
propagator on similar footing which leads to a theory whose graphs have the
same topology as QED with the $x^2$ propagator playing the role of the photon.
The bare vertex approximation is obtained by replacing the exact vertex
function by the bare one in the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations for the one and
two point functions. The second approximation, which we call the dynamic Debye
screening approximation, makes the further approximation of replacing the exact
$x^2$ propagator by its value at leading order in the 1/N expansion. These two
approximations are compared with exact numerical simulations for the quantum
roll problem. The bare vertex approximation captures the physics at large and
modest $N$ better than the dynamic Debye screening approximation.

equation of state (EoS). We find that, when TBFs are included, the stellar core
is almost equally populated by nucleons and hyperons. The resulting EoS, which
turns out to be extremely soft, has been used in order to calculate the static
structure of neutron stars. We obtain a value of the maximum mass of 1.26 solar
masses (1 solar mass $M_o \simeq 1.99 \cdot 10^{33} g$). Stellar rotations
increase this value by about 12%.

and (b) physical completeness of state descriptions, enable us to deduce a
Symmetric Permutation Rule(SPR): that by taking care with our state
descriptions, it is always possible to construct state vectors (or wave
functions) that are purely symmetric under pure permutation for all particles,
regardless of type distinguishability or spin. The conventional exchange
antisymmetry for two identical half-integer spin particles is shown to be due
to a subtle interdependence in the individual state descriptions arising from
an inherent geometrical asymmetry. For three or more such particles, however,
antisymmetrization of the state vector for all pairs simultaneously is shown to
be impossible and the SPR makes observably different predictions, although the
usual pairwise exclusion rules are maintained. The usual caveat of fermion
antisymmetrization - that composite integer spin particles (with fermionic
consitituents) behave only approximately like bosons - is no longer necessary.

transmission of the beam-splitter allows one to get the spectra of quadrature
fluctuations with forms of interest to us. It is shown that the choice of the
geometrical phase gives one the control of the position of the ellipse of
squeezing in the quadrature space XY. The extended Mandel parameter is
introduced and the photon statistics is scanned at all frequencies. It is
established that the sub- and super-Poissonian statistics formation can be
determined by the choice of the nonlinear phase addition and initial linear
phase shift between pulses. It is also shown that the self-phase modulation
(SPM) leads to the additional modulation of total photon number at the outputs
of the beam-splitter.
