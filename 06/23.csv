is described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, clustering
statistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,
correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory with
halo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, and
galaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function of
halo mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power
spectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and
the galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales
than their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. We find
that requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the APM
galaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at
large scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small
masses, m =10^10 Msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number
of galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass
limit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity
function or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum,
bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. Although halo
models agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher
order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are
spherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the
bispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite volume effects
in higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.

reconnection is dominated by repeated formation and subsequent coalescence of
magnetic islands (known as ``secondary tearing'' or ``impulsive bursty'' regime
of reconnection), while a continuously growing plasmoid is fed by newly
coalescing islands. Such a model, involving a current sheet and a growing

individual stars in individual images, a step that is fraught with dangers when
the images are undersampled. The key to avoiding systematic positional error in
undersampled images is to determine an extremely accurate point-spread function
(PSF). We apply the concept of the {\it effective} PSF, and show that in images
that consist of pixels it is the ePSF, rather than the often-used instrumental
PSF, that embodies the information from which accurate star positions and
magnitudes can be derived. We show how, in a rich star field, one can use the
information from dithered exposures to derive an extremely accurate effective
PSF by iterating between the PSF itself and the star positions that we measure
with it. We also give a simple but effective procedure for representing spatial
variations of the HST PSF. With such attention to the PSF, we find that we are
able to measure the position of a single reasonably bright star in a single
image with a precision of 0.02 pixel (2 mas in WF frames, 1 mas in PC), but
with a systematic accuracy better than 0.002 pixel (0.2 mas in WF, 0.1 mas in
PC), so that multiple observations can reliably be combined to improve the
accuracy by $\surd N$.

Mid-IR emission from NGC1052, NGC1155, and NGC6958 follows a de Vaucouleurs
profile. The ratio of 15/7 micron flux decreases with radius in these galaxies,
approaching the values empirically observed for purely stellar systems. In
NGC5866, the 7 and 15 micron emission is concentrated in the edge-on dust lane.
All the galaxies are detected in the [CII] line, and the S0s NGC1155 and
NGC5866 are detected in the [OI] line as well. The ISO-LWS observations of the
[CII] line are more sensitive measures of cool, neutral ISM than HI and CO by
about a factor of 10-100. Three of four early type galaxies, namely NGC1052,
NGC6958 and NGC5866, have low ratio FIR/Blue and show a lower [CII]/FIR, which
is due to a softer radiation field from old stellar populations. The low
[CII]/CO ratio in NGC5866 ([CII]/CO(1-0) < 570) confirms this scenario. We
estimate the UV radiation expected from the old stellar populations in these
galaxies and compare it to that needed to heat the gas to account for the
cooling observed [CII] and [OI] lines. In three out of four galaxies, NGC1052,
NGC5866 and NGC6958, the predicted UV radiation falls short by a factor of 2-3.
In view of the observed intrinsic scatter in the ""UV-upturn"" in elliptical
galaxies and its great sensitivity to age and metallicity effects, this is not
significant. However, the much larger difference (about a factor of 20) between
the UV radiation from old stars and that needed to produce the FIR lines for
NGC 1155 is strong evidence for the presence of young stars, in NGC1155.

about 1.5 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 where the contribution of discrete sources to
the CXB grows to 40-50%. A hardness ratio analysis reveals the presence of a
wide range of spectral shapes and that a fairly large fraction of sources
appear to be heavily absorbed, some of which showing soft components. A
comparison of the flux distribution of different subsamples confirms the
existence of a spectral hardening with decreasing flux. This effect is probably
due to an increasing percentage of absorbed sources at faint fluxes, rather
than to a gradual flattening of the spectral slope. Nearly all the sources for
which adequate ROSAT exposures exist, have been detected in the soft X-rays.
This confirms that soft spectral components are present even in strongly
absorbed objects, and that a large population of sources undetectable below a
few keV does not exist. A Ve/Va test provides evidence for the presence of
cosmological evolution of a magnitude similar to that found in soft X-ray
extragalactic sources. Evolution is present both in normal and absorbed
sources, with the latter population possibly evolving faster,although this
effect could also be the result of complex selection effects.

and X-ray properties known to be part of the Boroson and Green eigenvector 1.
We show that the steep soft-X-rays, which characterize the NLSy1s SEDs, change
the equilibrium of the two phase cloud-intercloud medium resulting in somewhat
higher BLR cloud densities, lower ionization parameter and larger BLR radii.
These modified conditions can explain the unusual emission line properties we
find in NLSy1.
  Using a specific model of an accretion disk with corona presented by Witt,
Czerny and Zycki (1997), we also show that the steep soft and hard-X-ray
continua can be explained if the $L/L_{Edd}$ ratios are larger than in
``normal'' Seyfert1/QSO strengthening earlier suggestions that the $L/L_{Edd}$
is the physical parameter driving this eigenvector.

generate delocalized states at the Fermi energy, which give rise to a finite

represents a very good initial state to achieve extremely accurate energies and
correlation functions with few Lanczos iterations. For large sizes ($L\le 98$)
the behavior is similar: the low-energy d-wave order parameter $P_d$ is weakly
affected by a couple of Lanczos iterations in the low doping $\delta\sim 10%$

the dephasing rate for electron transport through a quantum dot in the Coulomb

phase of the transmission amplitude. It is shown that the evolution of the
transmission phase may be dominated by non-universal features in the short-time
dynamics of the quantum dot. The controlled dephasing in Coulomb coupled
conductors is investigated. Examples comprise a single or multiple quantum dots
in close vicinity to a quantum point contact. The current through the quantum
point contact ""measures"" the state of the dots and causes dephasing. The
dephasing rate is derived using widely different theoretical approaches. The
Coulomb coupling between mesoscopic conductors may prove useful for future work
on electron coherence and quantum computing.

superconductors is a subject of ongoing intensive research. Over the last
decade, a variety of conceptually and methodologically different approaches to
the problem have been developed. Unfortunately, many of these theories
contradict each other, and the current literature displays a lack of consensus
on even the most basic physical observables. Adopting a symmetry-oriented
approach, the present paper attempts to identify the origin of the disagreement
between various previous approaches, and to develop a coherent theoretical
description of the different low-energy regimes realized in weakly disordered
d-wave superconductors. We show that, depending on the presence or absence of
time-reversal invariance and the microscopic nature of the impurities, the
system falls into one of four different symmetry classes. By employing a
field-theoretical formalism, we derive effective descriptions of these
universal regimes as descendants of a common parent field theory of
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten type. As well as describing the properties of each
universal regime, we analyse a number of physically relevant crossover
scenarios, and discuss reasons for the disagreement between previous results.
We also touch upon other aspects of the phenomenology of the d-wave
superconductor such as quasi-particle localization properties, the spin quantum
Hall effect, and the quasi-particle physics of the disordered vortex lattice.

identify a new static solution of the vacuum field equations which provides an
important test bed for characteristic evolution codes. We also show how
linearized solutions of the Bondi equations can be generated by solutions of
the scalar wave equation, thus providing a complete set of test beds in the
weak field regime. These tools are used to establish that the algorithm is
second order accurate and stable, subject to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition. In addition, the numerical versions of the Bondi mass and news
function, calculated at scri on a compactified grid, are shown to satisfy the
Bondi mass loss equation to second order accuracy. This verifies that numerical
evolution preserves the Bianchi identities. Results of numerical evolution
confirm the theorem of Christodoulou and Klainerman that in vacuum, weak
initial data evolve to a flat spacetime. For the class of asymptotically flat,
axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes, for which no nonsingular analytic solutions are
known, the algorithm provides highly accurate solutions throughout the regime

assumption of conformal flatness is seen. The position of the ISCO is found to
be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the spin on each black hole. At close

clarified. The phase of this theory with spontaneously broken conformal
symmetry gives various formulations of N=1 supergravity interacting with
matter, depending on the choice of the R-symmetry fixing.
  We have found that the locally superconformal theory is useful for describing
the physics of the early universe with a conformally flat FRW metric. Few
applications of superconformal theory to cosmology include the study of i)
particle production after inflation, particularly the non-conformal helicity
1/2 states of gravitino, ii) the super-Higgs effect in cosmology and the
derivation of the equations for the gravitino interacting with any number of
chiral and vector multiplets in the gravitational background with varying
scalar fields, iii) the weak coupling limit of supergravity and
gravitino-goldstino equivalence. This explains why gravitino production in the
early universe is not suppressed in the limit of weak gravitational coupling.

theories, interpreted as a strong coupling limit of supergravity.

realized by placing cold atoms in a pulsed, far-detuned, standing wave. If the

is pulsed quasi-periodically with two different frequencies, dynamical
localization is observed or not, depending on the two frequencies being
