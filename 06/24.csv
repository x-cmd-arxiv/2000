rapid passage of a companion galaxy could cause them. We examine whether the
center of mass of the visible matter becomes displaced from the center of mass
of the dark halo during the intruder's passage, thereby causing an asymmetric
response and asymmetric structure. Two dimensional $N$-body simulations
indicate that this can happen.
  We also explore some consequences of this offset. These include the center of
mass of the visible disk following a decaying orbit around the halo center of
mass and the development of transient one-armed spirals that persist for up to
six rotation periods.
  We then study the results of a variety of initial conditions based on such
offsets. We report on the results of several runs in which we initially offset
a disk from its halo's center of mass by an amount typical of the above
interaction. In some runs the halo is free to move, while in others it is held
fixed. We used three different mass distributions for the halo in these runs.
We find that the disk's center of mass spiraled inward creating a variety of
observed or observable phenomena including one-armed spirals, massive clumps of
particles, and counter-rotating waves. The systems settle into relatively
axisymmetric configurations. Whether or not the end states included a bar
depended on a variety of initial conditions.

changes during the observation. Ourmain result is that we find the X-ray
spectral index to be correlated with the UV flux. Furthermore, the broad-band
X-ray photon flux is also correlated with the UV continuum. These correlations
point towards a model in which the X-rays originate via thermal Comptonization
of UV seed photons. Furthermore, the UV is also correlated with the
extrapolation of the X-ray power law into the soft X-ray/EUV region. Our data
analysis therefore re-opens the possibility the the UV photons and their
variability arise from reprocessing, as long as the primary source of heating
is photo-electric absorption in the reprocessor, rather than Compton
downscattering, A coherent picture of the X-ray/UV variability can therefore be
constructed whereby absorption and reprocessing of EUV/soft X-rays in a
standard accretion disk produce a variable seed photon distribution which are
in turn up-scattered into the X-ray band. We also find a significant
correlation between the 2-10 keV flux and the 6.4 keV iron K-line suggesting
that at least some portion of the line originates within ~1 lt day of the X-ray
continuum source. Neither the power law photon index nor the Compton reflection
component are correlated with the 2-10 keV flux. The latter is not correlated
with the iron K line flux either. We do find an apparent correlation between
the X-ray spectral index and the strength of the Compton reflection component.
In an Appendix we show, however, that this can be produced by a combination of
statistical and systematic errors. We conclude the apparent variations in the
Compton reflection component may be an artifact of these effects.

spectral index n=0.8. In each model, one run was conducted using a spatially
uniform grid of particles and one using a refined grid in a large void. In all
three models and all environments tested, the mean angular momentum of merger
remnants (halo interaction products with mass ratios 3:1 or less) is greater
than non-merger remnants. Furthermore, the dispersion in the merger-remnant
angular momentum distribution is smaller than the dispersion of the non-merger
distribution. The interpretation most consistent with the data is that the
orbital angular momentum of the interactors is important in establishing the
final angular momentum of the merger product. I give the angular momentum

method can underestimate the mass of progenitors by 20%, hence yielding
improper formation redshifts of halos. With this caveat, however, the general

galaxy-size Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos in a flat, low-density cosmological
model with vacuum energy. We show thatalthough increasing the mass and force
resolution allows us to probe deeper into the inner halo regions, it does not
lead to steeper inner density profiles. Instead, the halo profiles converge at
scales larger than four times the formal resolution or the radius containing
more than 200 particles, whichever is larger. In the simulations presented in
this paper, we are able to probe density profile of a relaxed isolated
galaxy-size halo at scales r=(0.005-1)r_vir. We find that the density
distribution can be well approximated by the profile suggested by Moore etal
(1998): rho= x^{-1.5}(1+x^{1.5})^-1, where x=r/r_s and r_s is the
characteristic radius. The analytical profile proposed by Navarro et al. (1996)
rho= x^{-1}(1+x)^-2, also provides a good fit, with the same relative errors of
about 10% for radii larger than 1% of the virial radius. Both analytical
profiles fit equally well because for high-concentration galaxy-size halos the
differences between these profiles become significant only at scales well below
0.01r_vir. We also find that halos of similar mass may have somewhat different
parameters (characteristic radius, maximum rotation velocity, etc.) and shapes
of their density profiles. We associate this scatter in properties with
differences in halo merger histories and the amount of substructure present in
the analyzed halos.

  version","Astrophys.J.560:599-605,2001","10.1086/323070",,"astro-ph",,"  Studies of quasar absorption lines reveal that the low density intergalactic
medium at z ~ 3 is enriched to 0.001-0.01 solar metallicity. This enrichment
may have occurred in an early generation of Population III stars at redshift z
>~ 10, by protogalaxies at 6 <~ z <~ 10, or by larger galaxies at 3 <~ z <~ 6.
This paper addresses the third possibility by calculating the enrichment of the
IGM at z >~ 3 by galaxies of baryonic mass >~ 10^8.5 solar masses. We use
already completed cosmological simulations to which we add a prescription for
chemical evolution and metal ejection by winds, assuming that the winds have
properties similar to those observed in local starbursts and Lyman-break
galaxies. Results are given for a number of representative models, and we also
examine the properties of the galaxies responsible for the enrichment as well
as the physical effects responsible for wind escape and propagation. We find
that winds of velocity >~ 200-300 km/s are capable of enriching the IGM to the
mean level observed, though many low-density regions would remain metal free.
Calibrated by observations of Lyman-break galaxies, our calculations suggest
that most galaxies at z >~ 3 should drive winds that can escape and propagate
to large radii. The primary effect limiting the enrichment of low-density IG
gas in our scenario is then the travel time from high- to low-density regions,
implying that the metallicity of low-density gas is a strong function of
redshift.

as the mass-metallicity relation of observed galaxies, suggest that galaxies
lose a significant fraction of their metals to the intergalactic medium (IGM).
Theoretical studies of this process have concentrated on metal removal by
dynamical processes or supernova-driven winds. Here, we investigate the
enrichment of the IGM by the expulsion of dust grains from galaxies by
radiation pressure. We use already completed cosmological simulations, to which
we add dust assuming that most dust can reach the equilibrium point between
radiation pressure and gravitational forces. We find that the expulsion of dust
and its subsequent (partial) destruction in the IGM can plausibly account for
the observed level of C and Si enrichment of the z=3 IGM. At low-z, dust
ejection and destruction could explain a substantial fraction of the metals in
clusters, but it cannot account for all of the chemical species observed. Dust
expelled by radiation pressure could give clusters a visual opacity of up to
0.2-0.5 mag in their central regions even after destruction by the hot
intracluster medium; this value is interestingly close to limits and claimed
observations of cluster extinction. We also comment on the implications of our
results for the opacity of the general IGM. Finally, we suggest a possible
`hybrid' scenario in which winds expel gas and dust into galaxy halos but
radiation pressure distributes the dust uniformly through the IGM.

selecting hard sources: the survey has > 10 times as much effective area to
hard sources as it has to soft sources above a 0.5 - 2 keV flux level of 10^-14
erg/cm^2/s. The distribution of best fit spectral slopes of the hard sources
suggests that a typical ROSAT hard source in our survey has a spectral slope
alpha ~0. The hard sources have a steep number flux relation (dN/dS propto
S^-gamma with a best fit value of gamma = 2.72 +- 0.12) and make up about 15%
of all 0.5 - 2 keV sources with S > 10^-14 erg/cm^2/s. If their N(S) continues

the harder average spectra of ROSAT sources with S < 10^-14. They probably make
a strong contribution to the X-ray background at faint fluxes and could be the

largest number of different sequences have high symmetry. However only certain
symmetries are enhanced, e.g. x/y-mirror symmetry and $180^o$ rotation, while
others are suppressed. If it takes a large number of mutations to destabilize
the native state of a protein, then, by definition, the state is highly

high symmetry. It appears that the relationship between designability and

the model reproduces a set of known results in different limiting cases, and

drastically decreasing the extensional strength or measured Weissenberg number

of warped long-wavelength solutions of general relativity coupled to scalars
and gauge fields suggests that such an effect might be possible. However, in
some basic realizations of such solutions in M theory, we find that this effect
does not persist microscopically. It turns over either to screening or the

studied. In particular, the nucleon and pion flow in S+S and Pb+Pb collisions
at 160 AGeV is investigated. For simulations the microscopic quark-gluon string
model (QGSM) is applied. It is found that the directed flow of pions $v_1(y,
\Delta p_t)$ changes sign from a negative slope in the low-$p_t$ region to a
positive slope at $p_t \geq 0.6$ GeV/c as recently also observed
experimentally. The change of the flow behaviour can be explained by early
emission times for high-$p_t$ pions. We further found that a substantial amount
of high-$p_t$ pions are produced in the very first primary NN collisions at the
surface region of the touching nuclei. Thus, at SPS energies high-$p_t$
nucleons seem to be a better probe for the hot and dense early phase of nuclear
collisions than high-$p_t$ pions. Both, in the light and in the heavy system
the pion directed flow $v_1(p_t, \Delta y)$ exhibits large negative values when
the transverse momentum approaches zero, as also seen experimentally in Pb+Pb
collisions. It is found that this effect is caused by nuclear shadowing. The
proton flow, in contrary, shows the typical linear increase with rising $p_t$.

operations leads to the conclusion that permutation operations are
maximally-inseparable. For even N, we find the minimum SE and CC resources
which are sufficient to perform an arbitrary collective operation. These
minimum resources are 2(N-1) ebits and 4(N-1) bits, and these limits can be
attained using a simple teleportation-based protocol. We also obtain lower
