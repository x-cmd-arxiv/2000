ferromagnetic layer and Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 and Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3 as the spacer layers.
All the multilayers were grown on LaAlO3 (100) by pulse laser deposition. An
enhanced magnetoresistnace (defined (RH- R0)/R0) of more than 98% is observed
in these multilayers. Also a low field magnetoresistance of 41% at 5000 Oe is
observed in these multilayer films. The enhanced MR is attributed to the
induced double exchange in the spacer layer, which is giving rise to more
number of conducting carriers. This is compared by replacing the spacer layer
with LaMnO3 where Mn exists only in 3+ state and no enhancement is observed in
the La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 / LaMnO3 multilayers as double exchange mechanism can not
be induced by external magnetic fields.

  4-dimensional spacetime","Latex, 17 pages, No figure",,,,"gr-qc",,"  A lattice quantum gravity model in 4 dimensional Riemannian spacetime is
constructed based on the SU(2) Ashtekar formulation of general relativity. This
model can be understood as one of the family of models sometimes called ``spin
foam models.'' A version of the action of general relativity in continuum is
introduced and its lattice version is defined. A dimensionless ``(inverse)
coupling'' constant is defined so that the value of the action of the model is
finite per lattice point. The path integral of the model is expanded in the
characters and shown to be written as a sum over surface-like excitations in
spacetime. A 3 dimensional version of the model exists and can be reduced to
lattice BF theory. The expectation values of some quantities are computed in 3
dimensions and the meanings of the results are discussed. Although the model is
studied on a hyper cubic lattice for simplicity, it can be generalized to a
randomly triangulated lattice with small modifications.

One is the regular null geodesics and the other two are the null geodesics
which terminate at the singularity. The central massless singularity is
timelike naked singularity and satisfies the strong curvature condition along
the null geodesics except for the instant of singularity formation. The cluster
dynamically asymptotes to the singular static Einstein cluster in which
centrifugal force is balanced with gravity. The HIN solution provides an
interesting example which demonstrates that collisionless particles invoke
timelike naked singularity.

the traditional procedure of averaging over individuals and representing the
collective dynamics in terms of densities that obey partial differential
equations (PDE). The simulations show even for very simple elementary reactions
the spontaneous emergence of localized complex structures. In turn the
effective dynamics of these structures affects the average behavior of the
system in a very decisive way: systems which would according to the
differential equations approximation die, display in reality a very lively
behavior. Our conclusions are supported both by explicit microscopic
simulations and by analytic calculations. As the optimal method we propose a
mixture of microscopic simulation (MS) systems describing each reaction
separately, and average methods describing the average behavior of the agents.

resonances are found to be significant relative to the non-resonant amplitudes
in changing the differential cross sections at large scattering angles and
various spin observables. In particular, we suggest that a crucial test of our
predictions can be made by measuring the parity asymmetry and beam-target
double asymmetry at forward scattering angles.
