weak s-process, which along with the gamma-process and explosive helium and
carbon burning, produces nearly solar abundances of almost all nuclei from A=60

inelastically with the feeding infall. The disc-infall interaction determines
the dynamics and luminosity of the accretion flow. The inviscid disc radius can

a Comptonized X-ray spectrum with a break at $\sim 100$ keV. This accretion

with deep observations, the line emission extends well beyond the size of the
radio source but along the radio axis. Structures of similar surface brightness
would have not been seen in the snapshot images. These emission line structures
extend to scales of 10 to 30 kpc and cover a projected angle, when seen from
the nucleus, of 30 to 110 degrees, indicating that the nuclear illumination is
anisotropic. Photon counting arguments also support this interpretation. In six
objects the radio emission extends over more than 1 arcsec. In these cases the
line emission has an elongated structure, linking the nucleus to the
radio-lobes, possibly tracing the path of the invisible radio jets.
Nevertheless the emission line morphologies do not show the bow shocks at the
extremities of the radio lobes expected if they are sources whose expansion is
frustrated by a dense external medium. Our data favour the alternative model in
which CSSs are the young phase of the large size radio sources. When

rotation which results from deposition of planet's orbital angular momentum. It

that indeed about 50 percent of PNs progenitors do have close planets around
them, but the planets can have much lower masses, as low as 0.01 times
Jupiter's mass. To support this claim I follow the angular momentum evolution
of single stars as they evolve to the post-AGB phase. The prediction that on
average several such planets orbit each star, as in the solar system, still
holds.

agreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate
density and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of
redshift also agree well. Two ``quiescent'' models without starbursts are also
investigated. In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains
constant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc
dynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent
model is strongly ruled out as it does not produce enough high redshift
galaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent
model fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at
high redshift. A general conclusion is that star formation at high redshift
must be more efficient than locally. The collisional starburst model appears to
accomplish this naturally without violating other observational constraints.

hopping along the third direction, which normally tends to smear out the Landau
quantization gaps, can rather give rise to a fractal energy spectram akin to
Hofstadter's butterfly when a criterion, found here by mapping the problem to
two dimensions, is fulfilled by anisotropic (quasi-one-dimensional) systems. In
3D the angle of the magnetic field plays the role of the field intensity in 2D,
so that the butterfly can occur in much smaller fields. The mapping also
enables us to calculate the Hall conductivity, in terms of the topological
invariant in the Kohmoto-Halperin-Wu's formula, where each of $\sigma_{xy},
\sigma_{zx}$ is found to be quantized.

anomalous magnetic moment moving in the classical electromagnetic external

a purely quantum nature, it was observed for certain particular external field

corresponds to the classical radiation from an evolving magnetic dipole. We
argue that this correspondence has a more general validity in the case of an
unpolarized particle and derive a general formula for radiation in terms of the
external field strength and its derivatives. A classical dynamics of the spin
is described by the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation.

preserves half of the space-time supersymmetries of the string theory. Our
study indicates that there exists a decoupling limit for which the resulting

theory (NCYM). We also discuss independently the decoupling limit for NCYM in
this D3 brane background. Here we find that S-duality of NCYM theory does not
always give a NCOS theory. Instead, it can give an ordinary Yang-Mills with a
singular metric and an infinitely large coupling. We also find that the open
string coupling relation between the two S-duality related theories is modified
such that S-duality of a strongly coupled open-string/Yang-Mills theory does
not necessarily give a weakly coupled theory. The relevant gravity dual

forms use the assumption that the sourse of non-perturbative effects is not
specified and as a result represent the most general parametrization of
non-perturbative effects. We found that the allowed non-perturbative
superpotential is severely constrained when we use the cusp forms of the
modular group for its construction. By construction the poles of the
superpotential are either inside the fundamental domain or beyond. We also
found limits on the parameters of the superpotential by demanding that the
truncated potential for the gaugino condensate never breaks down at finite
values in the moduli space. The latter constitutes a criterion for avoiding
poles in the fundamental domain. However, the potential in most of the cases
avoids naturally singularities inside the fundamental domain, rendering the
potential finite. The minimum values of the limits on the parameters in the
superpotential may correspond to vacua with vanishing cosmological constant.

manifold. The path integral with twist operators is replaced by a path integral
on a covering space with no operator insertions. Thus, even though the CFT is
defined on the sphere, the correlators are expressed in terms of partition
functions on Riemann surfaces with a finite range of genus g. For large N, this
genus expansion coincides with a 1/N expansion. The contribution from the
covering space of genus zero is `universal' in the sense that it depends only
on the central charge of the CFT. For 3-point functions we give an explicit
form for the contribution from the sphere, and for the 4-point function we do
an example which has genus zero and genus one contributions. The condition for
the genus zero contribution to the 3-point functions to be non--vanishing is
similar to the fusion rules for an SU(2) WZW model. We observe that the 3-point
coupling becomes small compared to its large N limit when the orders of the
twist operators become comparable to the square root of N - this is a
manifestation of the stringy exclusion principle.

a problem of time optimal control of the unitary propagator. Radio frequency
pulses are used in coherent spectroscopy to implement a unitary transfer of
state. Pulse sequences that accomplish a desired transfer should be as short as
possible in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the
sensitivity of the experiments. Here, we give an analytical characterization of

general proofs are no more difficult than the specific problems of current
interest. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to
study have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right
invariant system on a compact Lie group, what is the minimum time required to
steer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In NMR
spectroscopy and quantum computing, this translates to, what is the minimum
