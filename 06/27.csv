mean matter density of the universe. Current measurements based on cluster
temperature surveys indicate that Omega_M ~ 0.3 with a 1-sigma statistical
error ~0.1, but the systematic errors in this method are of comparable size.
Many more high-z cluster temperatures will be arriving from Chandra and XMM in
the near future. In preparation for future cluster temperature surveys, this
paper analyses the cluster mass-temperature relation, with the intention of
identifying and reducing the systematic errors it introduces into measurements
of cosmological parameters. We show that the usual derivation of this relation
from spherical top-hat collapse is physically inconsistent and propose a more
realistic derivation based on a hierarchical merging model that more faithfully
reflects the gradual ceasing of cluster evolution in a low-Omega_M universe. We
also analyze the effects of current systematic uncertainties in the M-T
relation and show that they introduce a systematic uncertainty of ~0.1 in the
best-fitting Omega_M. Future improvements in the accuracy of the M-T relation
will most likely come from comparisons of predicted cluster temperature
functions with temperature functions derived directly from large-scale
structure simulations.

spectrum shows unambiguous broad absorption features while its double-lobed
radio morphology and luminosity clearly indicate a classic Fanaroff-Riley Type
II radio source. Its radio luminosity places it at the extreme of the recently
established class of radio-loud broad absorption line quasars (Becker et al.

that FIRST J101614.3+520916 is a typical FR-II quasar which has been
rejuvenated as a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar with a Compact Steep
Spectrum core. The direction of the jet axis of FIRST J101614.3+520916 can be
estimated from its radio structure and optical brightness, indicating that we
are viewing the system at a viewing angle of > 40 degrees. The position angles
of the radio jet and optical polarization are not well-aligned, differing by 20
to 30 degrees. When combined with the evidence presented by Becker et al.
(2000) for a sample of 29 BAL quasars showing that at least some BAL quasars
are viewed along the jet axis, the implication is that no preferred viewing
orientation is necessary to observe BAL systems in a quasar's spectrum. This,
and the probable young nature of compact steep spectrum sources, leads
naturally to the alternate hypothesis that BALs are an early stage in the lives
of quasars.

a peak at 1. The projected separation is in the range ~ 3 - 22 pc with a

Colour-Magnitude Diagrams using the OGLE-II photometric survey. The cluster
multiplets in general occur in OB stellar associations and/or HII region

The shocks heat the expanding ejecta, generate a tangled magnetic field and

largely considered for the origin of the spectrum and the fast variability in
gamma-ray bursts, here we consider it in the contest of relativistic jets of
blazars. We calculate the expected spectra, light curves and time correlations
between emission at different wavelengths. The dynamical evolution of the wind
explains the minimum distance for dissipation (~10^{17} cm) to avoid
$\gamma$--$\gamma$ collisions and the low radiative efficiency required to
transport most of the kinetic energy to the extended radio structures. The
internal shock model allows to follow the evolution of changes, both dynamical
and radiative, along the entire jet, from the inner part, where the jet becomes
radiative and emits at high energies ($\gamma$-jet), to the parsec scale, where
the emission is mostly in the radio band (radio-jet). We have produced some

south-east of NGC3077 where we recently detected molecular gas in the CO
(J=1-0) and (2-1) transitions. We find that the molecular gas is much more
extended than previously thought (several kpc). The CO emission can be
separated into at least 3 distinct complexes with equivalent radii between
250pc and 700pc and all well confined over a narrow range in velocity. For one
complex we have also obtained a CO (3-2) spectrum using the KOSMA 3m radio
telescope; utilizing an LVG model we find that the kinetic temperature for this
complex must be about 10K, and the H2 volume density between 600 and
10000cm^-3. Mass estimates based on virialization yield a total mass for the
complexes of order 2-4 10^7 M_sun, i.e. more than the estimated molecular mass
within NGC3077 itself. This implies that interactions between galaxies can
efficiently remove heavy elements and molecules from a galaxy and enrich the
intergalactic medium. A comparison of the distribution of HI and CO shows no
clear correlation. However, CO is only found in regions where the HI column
density exceeds 1.1 10^21 cm^-2. HI masses for the molecular complexes mapped
are of the same order as the corresponding molecular masses. Since the tidal
arm with its molecular complexes has all the ingredients to form stars in the
future, we are thus presumably witnessing the birth of a dwarf galaxy. This
process could be important for the formation of dwarf galaxies especially at
larger look-back times in the universe where galaxy interactions may have been
more frequent.

annihilations, production of secondary particles during annihilations, baryon
diffusion, and hydrodynamic processes are coupled to the nuclear reaction
network. We identify two dominant effects, according to the typical spatial
dimensions of the domains. Small antimatter domains are dissipated via neutron
diffusion prior to He4 synthesis at T_He4 \approx 80 keV, leading to a
suppression of the primordial He4 mass fraction. Larger domains are dissipated
below T_He4 via a combination of proton diffusion and hydrodynamic expansion.
In this case the strongest effects on the elemental abundances are due to
anti-p He4 annihilations, leading to an overproduction of He3 relative to H2
and to overproduction of Li6 via non-thermal nuclear reactions. Both effects
may result in light element abundances deviating substantially from the
standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis yields and from the observationally inferred
values. This allows us to derive stringent constraints on the antimatter
parameters. For some combinations of the parameters, one may obtain both, low
H2 and low He4, at a common value of the cosmic baryon density, a result

initial conditions of low-mass, isolated star formation. In previous
submillimeter dust continuum studies of such pre-stellar cores, it was found
that the derived column density profiles did not follow a single power-law such
as N[H2] \propto r^(-1) throughout their full extent but flattened out near
their center. These submillimeter observations however could not constrain the
density profiles at radii greater than ~ 10000 AU. The present absorption study
uses ISOCAM's sensitivity to map these pre-stellar cores in absorption against
the diffuse mid-infrared background. The goal was to determine their structure
at radii that extend beyond the limits of sensitivity of the submillimeter
continuum maps and at twiceas good an angular resolution. Among the 24 cores
observed in our survey, a majority of them show deep absorption features. The
starless cores studied here all show a column density profile that flattens in

a radius of ~ 5000-10000 AU, the typical column density profile steepens with
distance from core center and gets steeper than N[H2] \propto r^(-1), until it
eventually merges with the low-density ambient molecular cloud. At least three
of the cores present sharp edges at R ~ 15000-30000 AU and appear to be
decoupled from their parent clouds, providing finite reservoirs of mass for
subsequent star formation.

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The luminosity evolution of stars with highly condensed cores surrounded by
nuclear-burning shell(s) is analytically investigated with the aid of homology
relations. With respect to earlier works using a similar approach (e.g. Refsdal
& Weigert 1970; Kippenhahn 1981), the major improvement is that we derive all
the basic dependences (i.e. on core mass, core radius, and chemical
composition) in a completely generalised fashion, then accounting for a large
range of possible physical properties characterising the burning shell(s).
Parameterised formulas for the luminosity are given as a function of the (i)
relative contribution of the gas to the total pressure (gas plus radiation),
(ii) opacity source, and (iii) dominant nuclear reaction rates. In this way,
the same formalism can be applied to shell-burning stars of various
metallicities and in different evolutionary phases. In particular, we present
some applications concerning the luminosity evolution of RGB and AGB stars with
different chemical compositions, including the case of initial zero
metallicity. It turns out that homology predictions provide a good
approximation to the results of stellar model calculations. Therefore, the
proposed formalism is useful to understand the possible differences in the
luminosity evolution of shell-burning stars within a unified interpretative
framework, and can be as well adopted to improve the analytical description of
stellar properties in synthetic models.

characteristics very similar to those of ``normal'' giant ellipticals. The
luminosity, ellipticity, isophote twisting and amount of disky or boxy
isophotes are consistent with those found in non-active ellipticals and in
radio galaxies. In all cases the BL Lac nucleus is well centered in the main
body of its host galaxy, a result that argues strongly against the microlensing
hypothesis for any significant fraction of the population. A search for faint
sub-structures in the host galaxies has not revealed notable signatures of
tidal distortions or sub-components (faint disks, bars, X features, etc.), and
with only one exception, there are no prominent dusty features in the central
regions. Instead, the BL Lac host galaxies are smooth and unperturbed,
suggesting that strong external gravitational interactions are not important to
ongoing activity. A careful examination of the environment around the nucleus,
however, shows a high incidence of close companion objects, whose nature
remains unclear pending spectroscopic observations.

However the predicted number density of Lyman-limit systems by satellites is
\~0.1 (per unit redshift), which is four times smaller than that by halo

predicted number density of strong lines can be as much as 60% of the HST

topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and
topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically
present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in
spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from
the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and
hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based
approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and
Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with,
or better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and
automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves
comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no
hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a
significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination
of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic
models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the
literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause
and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas
pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.

  PostScript figures","Ph.D. Thesis, University of Pittsburgh, 2000",,,"gr-qc",,"  From Einstein's theory we know that besides the electromagnetic spectrum,
objects like quasars, active galactic nuclei, pulsars and black holes also
generate a physical signal of purely gravitational nature. The actual form of
the signal is impossible to determine analytically, which lead to use of
numerical methods.
  Two major approaches emerged. The first one formulates the gravitational
radiation problem as a standard Cauchy initial value problem, while the other
approach uses a Characteristic Initial value formulation. In the strong field
region, where caustics in the wavefronts are likely to form, the Cauchy
formulation is more advantageous. On the other side, the Characteristic
formulation is uniquely suited to study radiation problems because it describes
space-time in terms of radiation wavefronts.
  The fact that the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems are
complementary suggests that one may want to use the two of them together. In a
full nonlinear problem it would be advantageous to evolve the inner (strong
field) region using Cauchy evolution and the outer (radiation) region with the
Characteristic approach. Cauchy Characteristic Matching enables one to evolve
the whole space-time matching the boundaries of Cauchy and Characteristic
evolution. The methodology of Cauchy Characteristic Matching has been
successful in numerical evolution of the spherically symmetric
Klein-Gordon-Einstein field equations as well as for 3-D non-linear wave
equations. In this thesis the same methodology is studied in the context of the
Einstein equations.

corrections and express the factorizable virtual corrections in terms of the
known corrections to on-shell W-pair production and W decay. The calculation of
the bremsstrahlung corrections, i.e. the processes e+e- --> 4f+gamma in lowest
order, is based on the full matrix elements. The matching of soft and collinear
singularities between virtual and real corrections is done alternatively in two
different ways, namely by using a subtraction method and by applying
phase-space slicing. The O(alpha) corrections as well as higher-order
initial-state photon radiation are implemented in the Monte Carlo generator
RACOONWW. Numerical results of this program are presented for the
W-pair-production cross section, angular and W-invariant-mass distributions at
LEP2. We also discuss the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty of our approach.

shown that we can also get Dirac equation with four-fermion interaction in the

K\""{a}hler, we also generalize the construction to obtain N=2 SCVA's. We study
the BRST cohomology groups of the topological vertex algebras obtained by the
$A$ twist and the $B$ twist from these N=2 SCVA's. We show that for one of
them, the BRST cohomologies are isomorphic to $H^*(M, \Lambda^*(T^*M))$ and
$H^*(M, \Lambda^*(TM))$ respectively. This provides a mathematical formulation
of the $A$ theory and $B$ theory in physics literature. The connection with
elliptic genera is also discussed. Furthermore, when the manifold is
hyperk\""{a}hler, we generalize our constructions to obtain N=4 SCVA's. A
heuristic relationship with super loop space is also discussed.

and vector bundles. Our first result is a generalization of the Hard Lefschetz
theorem for cohomology with values in a pseudo-effective line bundle. The
Lefschetz map is shown to be surjective when (and, in general, only when) the
pseudo-effective line bundle is twisted by its multiplier ideal sheaf. This
result has several geometric applications, e.g. to the study of compact
K\""ahler manifolds with pseudo-effective canonical or anti-canonical line
bundles. Another concern is to understand pseudo-effectivity in more algebraic
terms. In this direction, we introduce the concept of an ""almost"" nef line
bundle, and mean by this that the degree of the bundle is nonnegative on
sufficiently generic curves. It can be shown that pseudo-effective line bundles
are almost nef, and our hope is that the converse also holds true. This can be
checked in some cases, e.g. for the canonical bundle of a projective 3-fold.
  From this, we derive some geometric properties of the Albanese map of compact
K\""ahler 3-folds.

Hamiltonian both in the momentum representation and in the position
representation (field theory). Solution of the two-mode problem including only
one mode each for the atomic and molecular condensates displays analogs of Rabi
oscillations and rapid adiabatic passage. A classical version of the field
theory for atoms and molecules is used to demonstrate that, in the presence of
photoassociating light, a joint-atom molecule is unstable against growth of
density fluctuations. Experimental complications, including spontaneous
emission and unwanted ""rogue"" photodissociation from a photoassociated molecule
are analyzed. A two-color Raman scheme is studied as a method to set up an
effective two-mode scheme with reduced spontaneous emission losses. We discuss
photoassociation rates and photoassociation Rabi frequencies for high-lying
