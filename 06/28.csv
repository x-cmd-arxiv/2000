of a substantial fraction of the flux of its intrinsic Lyman alpha emission
line on both sides of the Lyman alpha wavelength. The observed line profile is
richly informative. We show that a sufficiently accurate, high spectral
resolution ($R\approx 10^4$) measurement of the line profile of a bright quasar
is feasible using the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) as well as large
ground-based telescopes. Such a measurement has two potentially important
applications. First, the red side of the Lyman alpha emission line provides a
way to measure the quasar lifetime. Second, the blue side provides a direct
measure of the density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium at the quasar
redshift. The estimate of the absorption of the red side is limited by the
accuracy to which the intrinsic profile of the Lyman alpha emission line is
known. The blue side, however, does not sensitively depend on the intrinsic
profile, because the former is much narrower than the latter.

scenario is that of slow-roll inflation. However, very often, the unphysical
power-law inflation scenario is (implicitly) assumed in the CMB data analysis.
We show that the predicted multipole moments differ significantly in both
cases. We identify several misconceptions present in the literature (and in the
way inflationary relations are often combined in popular numerical codes). For
example, we do not believe that, generically, inflation predicts the relation
n_S - 1 = n_T for the spectral indices of scalar and tensor perturbations or
that gravitational waves are negligible. We calculate the CMB multipole moments
for various values of the slow-roll parameters and demonstrate that an
important part of the space of parameters (n_S, n_T) has been overlooked in the

the spatial distributions of cooling gas and absorbing material for a sample of

addition to adaptively-smoothed images in different bands. Most of the cooling
flow clusters display little substructure, unlike several of the

  We fitted an isothermal plasma model with galactic absorption and constant
metallicity to the mid-over-high energy colours in our clusters. Those clusters
with known strong cooling flows have inner contours which fit a significantly
lower temperature than the outer contours. Clusters in the sample without
strong cooling flows show no significant temperature variation. We also had to
increase the levels of absorbing material to fit the low-over-high colours at

accumulate absorbing material. No evidence for increased absorption was found

attempt to identify blue stragglers whose spectra are least contaminated by
binary effects (contamination by a binary companion or absorption by
circumstellar material). These ``best'' stragglers have metallicities ([Fe/H] =
-0.05) and abundance ratios of the blue stragglers are not significantly
different from those of the turnoff stars. Based on arguments from
hydrodynamical models of stellar collisions, we assert that the current upper
limits for the lithium abundances of all blue stragglers observed in M67 (by us
and others) are consistent with no mixing during the formation process,
assuming pre-main sequence and main sequence depletion patterns observed for
M67 main sequence stars. We discuss composition signatures that could more
definitively distinguish between blue straggler formation mechanisms in open
cluster stars.
  We confirm the spectroscopic detection of a binary companion to the straggler
S 1082. From our spectra, we measure a projected rotational speed of 90+/-20
km/sec for the secondary, and find that its radial velocity varies with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of ~ 25 km/sec. Because the radial velocities do not
vary with a period corresponding to the partial eclipses in the system, we
believe this system is currently undergoing mass transfer. In addition we
present evidence that S 984 is a true blue straggler (and not an unresolved
pair). If this can be proven, our detection of lithium may indicate a

general, an average rotation may increase the MS lifetime up to about 30 %; for

the rotational velocities at break-up: 1) The usual solution, which is shown to
apply when the Eddington ratio $\Gamma$ of the star is smaller than formally
0.639. 2) Above this value of $\Gamma$, there is a second root, inferior to the
first one, for the break-up velocity. This second solution tends to zero, when
$\Gamma$ tends towards 1. This second root results from the interplay of
radiation and rotation, and in particular from the reduction by rotation of the
effective mass in the local Eddington factor. The analysis made here should
hopefully clarify a recent debate between Langer (\cite{La97,La98}) and Glatzel
(\cite{Gla98}).
  The expression for the global mass loss-rates is a function of both $\Omega$
and $\Gamma$, and this may give raise to extreme mass loss-rates ($\Omega
\Gamma $-limit). In particular, for O-type stars, LBV stars, supergiants and
Wolf-Rayet stars, even slow rotation may dramatically enhance the mass loss
rates. Numerical examples in the range of 9 to 120 M$_{\odot}$ at various

similar for both types of particles and, for some energy spectra, exhibits
features specific to multiple-step Bose-Einstein condensation, for instance the
appearance of maxima in the specific heat.
  In the case of fermions, as the particle density increases, another
phenomenon is also observed. For certain types of single particle hamiltonians,
the specific heat is approaching asymptotically a divergent behavior at zero
temperature, as the Fermi energy $\epsilon_{\rm F}$ is converging towards any
value from an infinite discrete set of energies: ${\epsilon_i}_{i\ge 1}$. If
$\epsilon_{\rm F}=\epsilon_i$, for any i, the specific heat is divergent at T=0

approaches zero at low enough temperatures. The results are particularized for

The DCA incorporates non-local corrections to local approximations such as the
Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) by mapping the lattice problem with
disorder, and in the thermodynamic limit, to a self-consistently embedded
finite-sized cluster problem. It satisfies all of the characteristics of a
successful cluster approximation. It is causal, preserves the point-group and
translational symmetry of the original lattice, recovers the CPA when the
cluster size equals one, and becomes exact as $N_c\to\infty$. We use the DCA to
study the Anderson model with binary diagonal disorder. It restores sharp
features and band tailing in the density of states which reflect correlations
in the local environment of each site. While the DCA does not describe the
localization transition, it does describe precursor effects of localization.

high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductors is that they are all
derived from the hole-doping of their insulating antiferromagnetic (AF) parent
compounds. From the outset, the intimate relationship between magnetism and
superconductivity in these copper-oxides has intrigued researchers. Evidence
for this link comes from neutron scattering experiments that show the
unambiguous presence of short-range AF correlations (excitations) in cuprate
superconductors. Even so, the role of such excitations in the pairing mechanism
and superconductivity is still a subject of controversy. For
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, where $x$ controls the hole-doping level, the most
prominent feature in the magnetic excitations spectra is the ``resonance''.
Here we show that for underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$, where $x$ and $T_c$
are below the optimal values, modest magnetic fields suppress the resonance
significantly, much more so for fields approximately perpendicular rather than
parallel to the CuO$_2$ planes. Our results indicate that the resonance
measures pairing and phase coherence, suggesting that magnetism plays an
important role in the superconductivity of cuprates. The persistence of a field
effect above $T_c$ favors mechanisms with preformed pairs in the normal state
of underdoped cuprates.

perfect nesting of the Fermi surface leads to a metal-insulator transition at
arbitrarily small values of U, always accompanied by antiferromagnetic

transition takes place at a finite value of U, and frustration induces a
non-trivial competition among different magnetic phases. Indeed, within the
mean-field approximation in the slave-boson approach, as the interaction grows
the paramagnetic metal turns into a metallic phase with incommensurate spiral
ordering. Increasing further the interaction, a linear spin-density-wave is
stabilized, and finally for strong coupling the latter phase undergoes a

found from arguments of unification and anomaly cancellation under the

necessarily contains a part with coefficient proportional to the one loop beta

this symmetry. This gives circumstantial evidence for the existence of this

$n$-pointed curves of genus $g$. Our motivating conjecture is that a divisor on
$\mgn$ is ample iff it has positive intersection with all 1-dimensional strata
(the components of the locus of curves with at least $3g+n-2$ nodes). This
translates into a simple conjectural description of the cone by linear
inequalities, and, as all the 1-strata are rational, includes the conjecture
that the Mori cone is polyhedral and generated by rational curves. Our main
result is that the conjecture holds iff it holds for $g=0$. More precisely,
there is a natural finite map $r: \vmgn 0. 2g+n. \to \mgn$ whose image is the
locus $\rgn$ of curves with all components rational. Any 1-strata either lies
in $\rgn$ or is numerically equivalent to a family $E$ of elliptic tails and we
show that a divisor $D$ is nef iff $D \cdot E \geq 0$ and $r^*(D)$ is nef. We
also give results on contractions (i.e. morphisms with connected fibers to
projective varieties) of $\mgn$ for $g \geq 1$ showing that any fibration
factors through a tautological one (given by forgetting points) and that the
exceptional locus of any birational contraction is contained in the boundary.
Finally, by more ad-hoc arguments, we prove the nefness of certain special
classes.

thermal energies has recently been calculated using effective field-theory
methods. A comparison of this calculation with much more elaborate calculations
performed in the 70's is made. This allows one to assess the validity of this
new approach as presently used. It is found to overshoot the almost exact
calculations by a factor close to 2 for the contribution involving the ^3S_1
component of both the initial and final states. This is much larger than
anticipated by the authors. This discrepancy is analyzed and found to originate
from the over-simplified description of the deuteron and capture states which
underlies the new approach. The claim that earlier determinations of the sign
would be in error is also examined. It is found that the sign discrepancy is
most probably due, instead, to the fact that the pion-nucleon interaction
referred to by the authors corresponds to a parity-non-conserving potential
with a sign opposite to what is currently used. Some estimates and constraints
relative to the pnc piNN coupling, h^1_{\pi}, which the above asymmetry is
dependent on, are reviewed. Further details are given in an Appendix.

plays the essential role to define the off-shell T-matrix uniquely when the
complete Pauli-forbidden state exists. We analyze this using a simple solvable
model with no quark-quark interaction, and calculating the most general
T-matrix in the formulation developed by Noyes and Kowalski. This formulation
gives a certain condition for the existence of the solution in the
Lippmann-Schwinger resonating-group method. A new procedure to deal with the
corrections for the reduced masses and the internal-energy terms in the Lambda
N - Sigma N coupled-channel resonating-group equation is proposed.

  distribution for the small ""driving weights""",,,,,"physics.ed-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  The expansions or the compressions of the ideal gas in the quasi-static
Carnot cycle, can be performed (on adiabatic or isothermal way) by slowly
increasing or decreasing the external pressure by means of small weights acting
on the piston of the vessel containing the gas. We call them shortly the
``driving weights'' (dw). Let N be their number, a large one.
  To determine the work performed by the ideal gas in the cycle the ``driving
weights'' must be handled carefully. If we let them move on-off the piston only
horizontally, their vertical motions will be due only to the gas. Here we show
that, at the end, while some of them will have moved down (will have negative
raising) the remaining ones (the majority) will have moved up (will have
positive raising) so that the total work performed by the ideal gas equals the
total variation of the gravitational potential energy of the ``driving
weghts''.
  The cycle is performed in 2N time-steps. For each step t_i, with i in
1,..,2N, we give H(t_i), and DH(t_{i-1},t_i), respectively the height and the
raising of the piston. Moreover the overall raising of the individual dw's
(i.e. h_k, with k in 1...N), and their distribution are given in simple,
general cases. The efficiency and the dissipated work are also evaluated.
  This paper is aimed at imparting a deeper understanding of the ideal Carnot
Engine and may also be useful as a segment in a didactic path on elementary
calculus and statistics.

scalability. The resource requirements are analyzed for ideal linear optics

processes in non-ideal optics, including detector inefficiencies. The main
conclusion of our work is that the resource requirements for implementing
quantum communication or computation with LOQC are reasonable. Furthermore,
this work clearly demonstrates how special knowledge of the error behavior can
be exploited for greatly improving the fault tolerance and overheads of a

systems (qubits) for sending them in secrecy without entangled qubits shared by
two legitimate users (Alice and Bob). This method has the following two
properties. First, even if an eavesdropper (Eve) steals qubits, she can extract
information from them with certain probability at most. Second, Alice and Bob
can confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring
a signature. If Eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and
sends alternative ones (the Intercept/Resend attack), a probability that Alice
and Bob do not notice Eve's action is equal to (3/4)^m or less. Passwords for
decryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are
disclosed through a public channel. Enciphering classical information by this
method is equivalent to the one-time pad method with distributing a classical
key (random binary string) by the BB84 protocol. If Eve takes away qubits,
Alice and Bob lose the original quantum information. If we apply our method to
a state in iteration, Eve's success probability decreases exponentially. We
cannot examine security against the case that Eve makes an attack with using
entanglement. This remains to be solved in the future.
