verify the primary dependence of the M-DDO51 color on luminosity, and

low-luminosity spiral (M_B,i=-17.0) with a diffuse, low surface brightness
stellar disk and no discernible bulge component. Within 0.25' (725 pc) of the
disk center the global luminosity profile of UGC7321 can be reasonably
characterized by an exponential function with a scale height h_z=2.9"" (140 pc)
in H and h_z=3.1"" (150 pc) in R, making this among the thinnest galaxy disks
know. Near the disk center we derive a ratio of disk scale length to global
disk scale height h_r/h_z=14 in both H and R; near the edge of the disk,
h_r/h_z=10. At intermediate galactocentric radii (0.25'<r<1.5'), the disk of
UGC7321 becomes less peaked than an exponential near the galactic plane. At
these radii the vertical luminosity profiles can be well reproduced by a linear
combination of two isothermal disk components of differing scale heights. These
fits, together with the strong disk color gradients by Matthews, Gallagher, &
van Driel (1999), suggest that UGC7321 has multiple disk subcomponents
comprised of stellar populations with different ages and velocity dispersions.
Thus even examples of the thinnest pure disk galaxies exhibit complex structure
and signatures of dynamical heating.

significant fraction of the molecular interstellar medium resides in low column

not only of theoretical interest, but can be useful in planning supernova

supernovae are located at N discrete redshifts, with equal number of supernovae
at each redshift and with one redshift always being the maximum one probed.

satisfy the gravitino bound and the Universe becomes radiation dominated early
enough for nucleosynthesis. We illustrate the idea by considering steep

perturbations (both amplitude and slope) and reheat successfully. The scalar

X-ray source exhibits a number of flares with factors of 3-4 flux changes

the behaviour of other low luminosity active galaxies. It provides further
support for an accreting black hole model rather than an extreme stellar
process in accounting for the nuclear activity of NGC4395. The soft X-ray
emission below 3 keV is strongly attenuated by absorption. The energy spectrum
in this absorption band shows a dramatic change in response to the variation in

the spectral change. The absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity is 4e39 erg/s

Semantic parsing is one of the major bottlenecks of Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) systems and usually requires building expensive resources
not easily portable to other domains. Our approach obtains a case-role
analysis, in which the semantic roles of the verb are identified. In order to
cover all the possible syntactic realisations of a verb, our system combines
their argument structure with a set of general semantic labelled diatheses
models. Combining them, the system builds a set of syntactic-semantic patterns
with their own role-case representation. Once the patterns are build, we use an
approximate tree pattern-matching algorithm to identify the most reliable
pattern for a sentence. The pattern matching is performed between the
syntactic-semantic patterns and the feature-structure tree representing the
morphological, syntactical and semantic information of the analysed sentence.
For sentences assigned to the correct model, the semantic parsing system we are
presenting identifies correctly more than 73% of possible semantic case-roles.

relativistic field theory, (2) to use this regularization for defining a model
of stress-energy tensor that describes point-particles in post-Newtonian
expansions (e.g. 3PN) of general relativity. We consider specifically the case
of a system of two point-particles. We first perform a Lorentz transformation
of the system's variables which carries one of the particles to its rest frame,
next implement the Hadamard regularization within that frame, and finally come
back to the original variables with the help of the inverse Lorentz
transformation. The Lorentzian regularization is defined in this way up to any
order in the relativistic parameter 1/c^2. Following a previous work of ours,
we then construct the delta-pseudo-functions associated with this
regularization. Using an action principle, we derive the stress-energy tensor,
made of delta-pseudo-functions, of point-like particles. The equations of
motion take the same form as the geodesic equations of test particles on a
fixed background, but the role of the background is now played by the
regularized metric.

either in a black hole, or a naked singularity- which can communicate with

We present arguments that BN is associated with a specific topology of gluonic
fields, rather than with the valence quarks. The BN distribution is easily
confused with the difference between the quark and antiquark distributions. We
argue, however, that they have quite different x-dependences. The distribution
of BN asymmetry distribution is nearly constant at small x while q(x)-\bar q(x)
\propto \sqrt{x}. This constancy of BN produces energy independence of the \bar
pp annihilation cross section at high energies. Recent measurement of the
baryon asymmetry at small x at HERA confirms this expectation. The BN asymmetry
at mid-rapidities in heavy ion collisions is substantially enhanced by multiple
interactions, as has been observed in recent experiments at the SPS. The same
gluonic mechanism of BN stopping increases the production rate for cascade
hyperons in a good accord with data. We expect nearly the same as at SPS amount
of BN stopped in higher energy collisions at RHIC and LHC, which is, however,
spread ove larger rapidity intervals.

(enlarged) transverse separation (momentum). We also present a more intuitive
derivation based on the classic scattering theory of Moli\`ere. This derivation
helps to understand the origin of the dipole cross section, part of which comes
from attenuation of the quark, while another part is due to multiple
interactions of the quark. It also demonstrates that the lowest-order
rescattering term provides an A-dependence very different from the generally
accepted A^{1/3} behavior. The effect of broadening increases with energy, and
we evaluate it using different phenomenological models for the unintegrated

such neutrinos. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that neutrino induced

focused on several possible unbroken observable SO(10) subgroups at the string

models, and the string Standard-like Models (SLM). We extend this study to

models, in contrast to the case of the FSU5, the PS, and the SLM string models,
is that they can produce effective field theories that are free of Abelian
anomalies. We discuss the distinction between the two types of free fermionic
models which result in the presence, or absence, of an anomalous U(1). As a
counter example we also present a LRS model that does contain an anomalous

scattering matrix as a function of the $\eta N$-interaction strength is
investigated. The corresponding trajectory, starting on the physical sheet,
moves around the $\eta NN$ three-body threshold and continues away from the
physical area giving rise to virtual $\eta NN$-states. The search for poles on
the nonphysical sheets adjacent directly to the upper rim of the real energy

that it directly leads to a numerical procedure for calculating EoF. We present
