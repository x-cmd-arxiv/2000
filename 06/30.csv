optical-to-near IR colours (as R-K>5 or I-K>4). Originally this selection was
aimed at selecting old (> 1 Gyr) passively evolving elliptical galaxies at
intermediate redshift (1<z<2), but it was soon discovered that young
star-forming dusty galaxies can show similar colours and therefore be selected
in the same surveys. It is crucial to distinguish between these two populations
because they have very different consequences on the models of galaxy
formation. Here we show that old ellipticals and dusty starburst are expected
to show different colours in the (I-K) vs. (J-K) diagram for redshift range
1<z<2, providing thus a useful tool to classify ERGs in large samples up to
K<20. This is mainly due to the fact that old galaxies at these redshifts have
a strong 4000 ang. break at lambda<1.2 mic. (J band), while dusty galaxies show
a smoother spectral energy distributions and therefore redder J-K colours. We
discuss this difference in detail both in the framework of the stellar
population synthesis models and by using observed spectra. The selection
criterion is also compared with the properties of ERGs of known nature. We also
show that this colour selection criterion is also useful to separate the ERGs
from brown dwarf stars showing similar optical-to-IR colours.

catalogues deriving from imaging data, as those of the ESO Imaging Survey. Our
algorithm is a matched filter one, similar to that adopted by Postman et al.
(1996), aiming at identifying cluster candidates by using positional and
photometric data simultaneously. The main novelty of our approach is that
spatial and luminosity filter are run separately on the catalogue and no
assumption is made on the typical size nor on the typical M* for clusters, as
these parameters intervene in our algorithm as typical angular scale (sigma)
and typical apparent magnitude m*. Moreover we estimate the background locally
for each candidate, allowing us to overcome the hazards of inhomogeneous
datasets. As a consequence our algorithm has a lower contamination rate -
without loss of completeness - in comparison to other techniques, as tested
through extensive simulations. We provide catalogues of galaxy cluster
candidates as the result of applying our algorithm to the I-band data of the
EIS-wide patches A and B.

the structure of the dust cloud in the Solar system between 0.5 and 100 AU

of the `kuiperoidal' dust cloud based on the distribution of 280 dust particle
trajectories produced by 100 known Kuiper belt objects ; the resulting 3-D grid
consists of $1.9\times 10^6$ cells containing $1.2\times 10^{11}$ particle

are taken into account: 1) gravitational scattering on the eight planets
(neglecting Pluto); 2) planetary resonances; 3) radiation pressure; and 4) the
Poynting-Robertson (P-R) and solar wind drags. We find the dust distribution
highly non-uniform: there is a minimum in the kuiperoidal dust between Mars and
Jupiter, after which both the column and number densities of kuiperoidal dust
sharply increase with heliocentric distance between 5 and 10 AU, and then form
a plateau between 10 and 50 AU. Between 25 and 45 AU, there is an appreciable
concentration of kuiperoidal dust in the form of a broad belt of mostly
resonant particles associated with Neptune. In fact, each giant planet
possesses its own circumsolar dust belt consisting of both resonant and
gravitationally scattered particles. As with the cometary belts simulated in
our related papers (Ozernoy, Gorkavyi, & Taidakova 2000a,b), we reveal a
complex resonant structure of the dust belts containing rich families of
resonant peaks and gaps. An important result is that both the column and number
dust density are more or less flat between 10 and 50 AU, which might explain
the surprising data obtained by Pioneers 10 & 11 and Voyager that the dust

  The average iron abundances we obtain for the two clusters are [Fe/H]=0.07

first dredge-up. The sodium abundance shows a well defined correlation with
stellar mass in the 2-3 Mo range. The agreement between our Na abundance
determinations in NGC 2360 and our model predictions at 2 Mo is very good. In
contrast, the overabundance in one of the three stars in NGC 2447 exceeds that
predicted at 3 Mo by ~0.08 dex, which is significant compared to the
observational error bars. The effects of core overshooting, convection

  An oxygen deficiency relative to iron by 0.2 dex is measured in our stars, in

Power Spectral Density: PSD) over the spatial frequency range of f=0.05 - 1
arcmin^-1. The PSDs are found to be rather flat at low spatial frequencies (f
<= 0.1 arcmin^-1), slowly decreasing toward higher frequencies. These spectra
are unlike the power-law ones seen in the IR cirrus fluctuations, and are well
explained by randomly distributed point sources. Furthermore, point-to-point
comparison between 90 micron and 170 micron brightness shows a linear
correlation between them, and the slope of the linear fit is much shallower
than that expected from the IR cirrus color, and is consistent with the color
of galaxies at low or moderate redshift(z < 1). We conclude that the brightness
fluctuations in the Lockman Hole are not caused by the IR cirrus, but are most
likely due to faint star-forming galaxies. We also give the constraints on the
galaxy number counts down to 35 mJy at 90 micron and 60 mJy at 170 micron,

the growth of non-perturbatively large quantum fluctuations which shut off the
inflationary growth of the scale factor. A very specific combination of these
large quantum fluctuations plus the inflaton zero mode assemble into a new
effective field. This new field behaves classically and it is the object which
actually rolls down. The metric perturbations during inflation are computed
using this effective field and the Bardeen variable for superhorizon modes

  the meaning of conformal (and chiral) symmetry of massive discrete-fields",,,,"hep-th gr-qc hep-ph math-ph math.MP quant-ph",,"  Conformal symmetry is taken as an attribute of theories of massless fields in
manifolds with specific dimensionalities. This paper shows that this is not an
absolute truth; it is a consequence of the mathematical representation used for
the physical interactions. It introduces a new kind of representation where the
propagation of massive (invariant mass) and massless interactions are unifiedly
described by a single conformally symmetric Green's function. Sources and
fields are treated at a same footing, symmetrically, as discrete fields - the
fields in this new representation - fields defined with support on straight
lines embedded in a (3+1)-Minkowski manifold. The discrete field turns out to
be a point in phase space. It is finite everywhere. With a finite number of
degrees of freedom it does not share the well known problems faced by the
standard continuous formalism which can be retrieved from the discrete one by
an integration over a hypersurface. The passage from discrete to continuous
fields illuminates the physical meaning and origins of their properties and
problems. The price for having massive discrete field with conformal symmetry
is of hiding its mass and time-like velocity behind its non-constant
proper-time.

  Experiment","10 pages, 6 figures","Phys. Rev. E 63, 046701 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevE.63.046701",,"quant-ph",,"  If a quantum mechanical particle is scattered by a potential well, the wave
function of the particle can propagate with negative phase time. Due to the
analogy of the Schr\""odinger and the Helmholtz equation this phenomenon is
expected to be observable for electromagnetic wave propagation. Experimental
data of electromagnetic wells realized by wave guides filled with different
dielectrics confirm this conjecture now.

maximally) entangled bipartite states of arbitary dimension shared pairwise
between three or more parties in a chain. The intermediate parties perform
generalised Bell measurements with the result that the two end parties end up
sharing a entangled state which can be converted into maximally entangled
states. We obtain an expression for the average amount of maximal entanglement
concentrated in such a scheme and show that in a certain reasonably broad class
of cases this scheme is provably optimal and that, in these cases, the amount
of entanglement concentrated between the two ends is equal to that which could
be concentrated from the weakest link in the chain.

derived with the spin degree of freedom taken into account. It is shown that it
can be expressed with the help of correlation functions for a polarized
electron beam of all orders up to k and the degree of spin polarization. The
form of the correlation function suggests that if the electron beam is not
highly polarized, observing multi-particle correlations should be difficult.
The result can be applied also to chaotic photon beams, the degree of spin
polarization being replaced by the degree of polarization.

in principle enables a test to discard non-contextual hidden-variable models at

errors are independent, an explicit error bound of 1.42% is derived, below
which a Kochen-Specker contradiction occurs.
