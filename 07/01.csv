supermassive black holes, is investigated. The stellar density is assumed to
follow a power law, rho ~ 1/r^gamma, with gamma=1 or gamma=2. At low energies
the motion is essentially regular; the major families of orbits are the tubes
and the pyramids. Pyramid orbits are similar to box orbits but have their major
elongation parallel to the short axis of the figure. A number of regular orbit
families associated with resonances also exist, most prominently the banana
orbits, which are also elongated with the short axis. At a radius where the
enclosed stellar mass is a few times the black hole mass, the pyramid orbits
become stochastic. The energy of transition to this ``zone of chaos'' is
computed as a function of gamma and of the shape of the stellar figure; it
occurs at lower energies in more elongated potentials. Our results suggest that
supermassive black holes may place tight constraints on departures from
triaxiality in galactic nuclei, both by limiting the allowed shapes of regular
orbits and by inducing chaos.

to determine cosmological parameters. The results are consistent with our
previous results, and indicate that the current value of the mean mass density
of the universe is significantly less than the critical value. A universe with
$\Omega_m$ of unity is ruled out at 99.0% confidence, and the best fitting

produce a collimated outflow is estimated. Typical total lifetimes are $\sim

those of low-redshift clusters of galaxies are obtained. Thus, some clusters of
galaxies, or cores of clusters, exist at redshifts of one to two.
  A new method of estimating the thermal pressure of the ambient gas in the
vicinity of a powerful classical double radio source is presented. This new
estimate is independent of synchrotron and inverse Compton aging arguments, and
depends only upon the properties of the radio lobe and the shape of the radio
bridge. Thermal pressures on the order of $10^{-10} {dyne cm}^{-2}$, typical of
gas in low-redshift clusters of galaxies, are found for the environments of the
sources studied here. It is shown that appreciable amounts of cosmic microwave

bag model. The frequencies of the fastest rotating configurations described by

simplest SS MIT bag model. We determine a number of physical parameters for
such stars and compare them with those obtained for NS. We construct constant
baryon mass equilibrium sequences both normal and supramassive. Similarly to
the NS a supramassive SS, prior to collapse to a black hole, spins up as it
loses angular momentum. We find the upper limits on maximal masses and maximal
frequencies of the rotating configurations. We show that the maximal rotating
frequency for each of considered evolutionary sequences is never the Keplerian
one. A normal and low mass supramassive strange stars gaining angular momentum
always slows down just before reaching the Keplerian limit. For a high mass
supramassive SS sequence the Keplerian configuration is the one with the lowest
rotational frequency in the sequence. The value of $T/W$ for rapidly rotating
SS of any mass is significantly higher than those for ordinary NS. For
Keplerian configurations it increases as mass decreases. The results are robust

splitting is large and tunable. In particular, via a combination of back- and
front-gate biases, we can tune the splitting while keeping the 2D hole density
constant. The data also reveal a surprising result regarding the
magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas) oscillations in a 2D system with
spin-split energy bands: the frequencies of the oscillations are {\it not}
simply related to the population of the spin-subbands. Next we concentrate on
the metallic-like behavior observed in these 2D holes and its relation to
spin-splitting. The data indicate that the metallic behavior is more pronounced
when two spin-subbands with unequal populations are occupied. Our measurements
of the magnetoresistance of these 2D hole systems with an in-plane magnetic
field corroborate this conclusion: while the system is metallic at zero
magnetic field, it turns insulating when one of the spin-subbands is
depopulated at high magnetic field.

band hole is studied as a function of the filling factor $\nu$ and the
separation $d$ between the electron and hole layers. The response of the 2DEG
to the hole changes abruptly at $d$ of the order of the magnetic length
$\lambda$. At $d<\lambda$, the hole binds electrons to form neutral ($X$) or
charged ($X^-$) excitons, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum probes the
lifetimes and binding energies of these states rather than the original
correlations of the 2DEG. The ``dressed exciton'' picture (in which the
interaction between an exciton and the 2DEG was proposed to merely enhance the
exciton mass) is questioned. Instead, the low energy states are explained in
terms of Laughlin correlations between the constituent fermions (electrons and
$X^-$'s) and the formation of two-component incompressible fluid states in the
electron--hole plasma. At $d>2\lambda$, the hole binds up to two Laughlin
quasielectrons (QE) of the 2DEG to form fractionally charged excitons
$h$QE$_n$. The previously found ``anyon exciton'' $h$QE$_3$ is shown to be
unstable at any value of $d$. The critical dependence of the stability of
different $h$QE$_n$ complexes on the presence of QE's in the 2DEG leads to the
observed discontinuity of the PL spectrum at $\nu={1\over3}$ or ${2\over3}$.

less in the weak coupling region in log U type simulation. Those values are
weakened even further in U-linear type. The horizon function defined by

preheating through inflaton decay can be significantly modified by instant
preheating, and may even lead to a decrease in the number of fermions produced.

content of an individual finite object, a similarly absolute notion is needed
for the relation between an individual data sample and an individual model
summarizing the information in the data, for example, a finite set (or

statistical theory based on such relations between individual objects can be
called algorithmic statistics, in contrast to classical statistical theory that
deals with relations between probabilistic ensembles. We develop the
algorithmic theory of statistic, sufficient statistic, and minimal sufficient
statistic. This theory is based on two-part codes consisting of the code for
the statistic (the model summarizing the regularity, the meaningful
information, in the data) and the model-to-data code. In contrast to the
situation in probabilistic statistical theory, the algorithmic relation of
(minimal) sufficiency is an absolute relation between the individual model and
the individual data sample. We distinguish implicit and explicit descriptions
of the models. We give characterizations of algorithmic (Kolmogorov) minimal
sufficient statistic for all data samples for both description modes--in the
explicit mode under some constraints. We also strengthen and elaborate earlier
results on the ``Kolmogorov structure function'' and ``absolutely
non-stochastic objects''--those rare objects for which the simplest models that
summarize their relevant information (minimal sufficient statistics) are at
least as complex as the objects themselves. We demonstrate a close relation
between the probabilistic notions and the algorithmic ones.

  For such a group we can define its Newton polygon (abbreviated NP). This is
invariant under isogeny. For an abelian variety (in characteristic p) the
Newton polygon of its p-divisible group is ``symmetric''.
  In 1963 Manin conjectured that conversely any symmetric Newton polygon is
``algebroid''; i.e., it is the Newton polygon of an abelian variety. This
conjecture was shown to be true and was proved with the help of the
``Honda-Serre-Tate theory''. We give another proof.
  Grothendieck showed that Newton polygons ``go up'' under specialization: no
point of the Newton polygon of a closed fiber in a family is below the Newton
polygon of the generic fiber. In 1970 Grothendieck conjectured the converse:
any pair of comparable Newton polygons appear for the generic and special fiber
of a family. This was extended by Koblitz in 1975 to a conjecture about a
sequence of comparable Newton polygons. We prove these conjectures.

affirmative, in fact with the base field Q replaced by any number field F. Our

appeals to the local regularity properties of Eisenstein series and the scalar
products of their truncations.
  One of the applications of this result is that the space of cusp forms on
SL(2) has multiplicity one. Concretely this means the following: If f, g are
newforms of holomorphic or Maass type with trivial character such that the
squares of the p-th coeficients of f and g are the same at almost all primes p,

these additional interactions introduce new processes with light meson
exchanges and increase significantly the total scattering cross sections of
charm mesons by pion and rho meson.

Langevin equation. The method consists of identifying solvable operators in the
Fokker-Planck equation, factorizing the evolution operator for small time steps
to fourth order and implementing the factorization process numerically. A key
contribution of this work is to show how certain double commutators in the
factorization process can be simulated in practice. The method is general,
applicable to the multivariable case, and systematic, with known procedures for
doing fourth order factorizations. The fourth order convergence of the
resulting algorithm allowed very large time steps to be used. In simulating the
Brownian dynamics of 121 Yukawa particles in two dimensions, the converged
result of a first order algorithm can be obtained by using time steps 50 times
as large. To further demostrate the versatility of our method, we derive two
new classes of fourth order algorithms for solving the simpler Kramers equation
without requiring the derivative of the force. The convergence of many fourth
order algorithms for solving this equation are compared.

  Based on Neuroscience, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag,
  Heidelberg",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.NC",,"  Does synchronization between action potentials from different neurons in the
visual system play a substantial role in solving the binding problem? The
binding problem can be studied quantitatively in the broader framework of the
information contained in neural spike trains about some external correlate,
which in this case is object configurations in the visual field. We approach
this problem by using a mathematical formalism that quantifies the impact of
correlated firing in short time scales. Using a power series expansion, the
mutual information an ensemble of neurons conveys about external stimuli is
broken down into firing rate and correlation components. This leads to a new
quantification procedure directly applicable to simultaneous multiple neuron
recordings. It theoretically constrains the neural code, showing that
correlations contribute less significantly than firing rates to rapid
information processing. By using this approach to study the limits upon the
amount of information that an ideal observer is able to extract from a
synchrony code, it may be possible to determine whether the available amount of
information is sufficient to support computational processes such as feature
binding.

superior to similarly iterated higher order algorithms based on the standard

step-size independent error functions associated with energy conservation and
the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector when solving a highly eccentric
Kepler problem. For orders 6, 8, 10 and 12, the new algorithms are
approximately a factor of $10^3$, $10^4$, $10^4$ and $10^5$ better.

  ((1) Bridge, (2) Overture Computing Corp., (3) University of Pennsylvania)","A new Loan-Stock Financial Instrument","9 pages",,,"58-263","physics.gen-ph",,"  A new financial instrument (a new kind of a loan) is introduced. The
loan-stock instrument (LSI) combines fixed rate instruments (loans, etc.) with
other financial instruments that have higher volatilities and returns (stocks,
mutual funds, currencies, derivatives, options, etc.). This new loan depends on
the value of underlying security (for example, stock) in such a way that when
underlying security increases, the value of loan decreases and backwards. The
procedure to create a risk free portfolio and a technique to fairly price the
LSI is described. The philosophy behind this procedure is quite similar to the
Black-Scholes formalism in option theory. Creation of the risk free portfolio
is possible because the change in the underlying security offsets the change in
the value of the loan (or the amount that the borrower has to repay). The new
financial instrument takes an advantage of the fact that on average the stock
market grows in time. It is beneficial for both the borrower and the lender.
The LSI is more attractive for the borrower than the traditional loan is due to
the decrease in the amount that has to be repaid. This attractiveness
constitutes the benefit for the lender in terms of the market share among the
borrowers. In addition, the lender can charge the extra premium.
