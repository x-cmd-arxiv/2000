6363 A. It turned out that both the abundances from the permitted line
features, O I 7771-5 and O I 8446, agree quite well with each other, while the
forbidden line yields somewhat discrepant and divergent abundances with a
tendency of being underestimated on the average. The former (7773/8446)
solution, which we believe to be more reliable, gives a fairly tight [O/Fe] vs.
[Fe/H] relation such that increasing steadily from [O/Fe] = 0.6 (at [Fe/H] =
-1.5) to [O/Fe] = 1.0 (at [Fe/H] = -3.0), in reasonable consistency with the
trend recently reported based on the analysis of the UV OH lines. We would
suspect that some kind of weakening mechanism may occasionally act on the
formation of [O I] forbidden lines in metal-poor stars. Therefore, [O I] lines
may not be so a reliable abundance indicator as has been generally believed.

radiative condensation, irrespective of the \gamma, the gas specific heat
ratio. So, the filament becomes denser due to the quasi-hydrostatic flows and
the density at the center increases in proportion to (t_{0}-t)^{-1}, where t

the propeller stage. It is believed that a magnetic propeller acts in two such
stars CH Cyg and
  MWC 560. We review a diversity of manifestations of the propeller there. In
these systems in a quiescent state the accretion onto a white dwarf from the
strong enough wind of a companion star is suppressed by the magnetic field, and
the hot component luminosity is low. Since the gas stored in the envelope
eventually settles to the corotation radius the star-propeller reveals itself
by long-time outbursts, short-time brightness dips, strong amplitude
flickering, ejection of a powerful wind and jets. The envelope appears to be
stratified and inhomogeneous because of the shock pumping of the propeller. At
this stage, at which catastrophic transitions to the accretion stage and back
are possible, the release of energy and angular momentum of the white dwarf is
maximum. Using this property, we estimate the magnetic field strength of the
white dwarfs in CH Cyg and MWC 560 to be of order $10^8$ G.
  The most spectacular property of these stars - jets - is inherently connected
with the propeller. This suggests hydromagnetic models of jet acceleration.
