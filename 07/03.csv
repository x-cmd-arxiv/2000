optical counterpart of GRB980425, is presented, and synthetic light curves and
spectra are compared with the observations. The first 30 days of the light
curve and the broad line features of the spectra can be reproduced with the
hydrodynamical model of the explosion of a 14$M_\odot$ C+O star, the core of a
star with initial mass 40$M_\odot$, assuming that the explosion was very
energetic (kinetic energy $E_{\rm K} = 5 \times 10^{52}$ erg) and that
0.4$M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni were synthesized. At late times, however, the
observed light curve tail declines more slowly than this energetic model, and
is in better agreement with a less energetic ($E_{\rm K} = 7 \times 10^{51}$
erg) one. This shift to a less energetic model may imply that the inner part of
the ejecta has higher density and lower velocities than the spherically
symmetric model with $E_{\rm K} = 5 \times 10^{52}$ erg, so that $\gamma$-rays
deposit more efficiently. We suggest that an aspherical explosion can produce
such a structure of the ejecta. We also study detailed nucleosynthesis
calculations for hyper-energetic supernova explosions and compare the yields
with those of normal supernovae.

central black holes. In this paper we explore the influence of black holes on
the lensing properties. We model the lens as an isothermal ellipsoid with a
finite core radius plus a central black hole. We show that the presence of the
black hole substantially changes the critical curves and caustics. If the black
hole mass is above a critical value, then it will completely suppress the
central images for all source positions. Realistic central black holes likely
have masses below this critical value. Even in such sub-critical cases, the
black hole can suppress the central image when the source is inside a zone of
influence, which depends on the core radius and black hole mass. In the
sub-critical cases, an additional image may be created by the black hole in
some regions, which for some radio lenses may be detectable with
high-resolution and large dynamic-range VLBI maps. The presence of central
black holes should also be taken into account when one constrains the core
radius from the lack of central images in gravitational lenses.

deconvolution procedure on ESP mock catalogues drawn from large N-body

applicable to any survey composed by a collection of circular fields with
arbitrary pattern on the sky, as typical of surveys based on fibre
spectrographs. The estimated power spectrum has a well-defined power-law shape
$k^n$ with $n\simeq -2.2$ for $k\ge 0.2 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and a smooth bend to a
flatter shape ($n\simeq -1.6$) for smaller $k$'s. The smallest wavenumber,
where a meaningful reconstruction can be performed ($k\sim 0.06 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$),
does not allow us to explore the range of scales where other power spectra seem
to show a flattening and hints for a turnover. We also find, by direct
comparison of the Fourier transforms, that the estimate of the two-point
correlation function $\xi(s)$ is much less sensitive to the effect of a
problematic window function as that of the ESP, than the power spectrum.
Comparison to other surveys shows an excellent agreement with estimates from
blue-selected surveys. In particular, the ESP power spectrum is virtually
indistinguishable from that of the Durham-UKST survey over the common range of
$k$'s, an indirect confirmation of the quality of the deconvolution technique
applied.

is also strong evidence of an assymetry associated with the Galactic warp. This
flaring and warping of the stellar disk is very similar to the features

in density observed near the Galactic plane: stars located at lower

necessary to introduce a disk cut-off to explain the drop in density. It is
also not clear how this flaring disk is distinct from the thick disk in the

maximum space velocities are lower (750 km/s instead of 1300 km/s. We find
evidence for radial acceleration of the emission-line knots to a distance of
160 pc, followed by deceleration that approaches the systemic velocity at a
distance of 290 pc (for a distance to NGC 4151 of 13.3 Mpc). Other similarities
to the kinematics of NGC 1068 are: 1) there are a number of high-velocity
clouds that are not decelerated, suggesting that the medium responsible for the
deceleration is patchy, and 2) the bicone in NGC 4151 is at least partially
evacuated along its axis. Together, these two Seyfert galaxies provide strong
evidence for radial outflow (e.g., due to radiation and/or wind pressure) and
against gravitational motion or expansion away from the radio jets as the

absorbed by gas within 30 pc of the central source. We find no strong evidence

photoionized by scattered continuum radiation. There are several implications
of this complicated physical scenario. First, the hidden active nucleus is the
dominant source of ionizing radiation in the inner NLR. The absorption of
continuum radiation along the line-of-sight to the redshifted northeast
quadrant may result from the intersection of the ionization cone and the plane
of the host galaxy. Finally, the evidence for shock-induced continuum radiation

systems. Separating the bulk from interface response we find that for statics
to be retrievable from dynamics the interface contribution must be
asymptotically negligible. How fast this happens depends on dimensionality.
There exists a critical dimensionality above which the interface response
vanishes like the interface density and below which it vanishes more slowly. At
$d=1$ the interface response does not vanish leading to the violation of the
FMPP scheme. This behavior is explained in terms of the competition between
curvature driven and field driven interface motion.

the viewpoint of the scaling concepts. The Thouless number g(L) is not the only
essential variable in scale transformations, because there is the second
parameter connected with the off-diagonal disorder. The investigation of the
resulting two-parameter scaling has revealed two scenarios, and the switching
from one to another scenario determines the upper critical dimensionality. The
first scenario corresponds to the conventional one-parameter scaling and is
characterized by the parameter g(L) invariant under scale transformations when
the system is at the critical point. In the second scenario, the Thouless
number g(L) grows at the critical point as L^{d-d_c2}. This leads to violation
of the Wegner relation s=\nu(d-2) between the critical exponents for
conductivity (s) and for localization radius (\nu), which takes the form
s=\nu(d_c2-2). The resulting formulas for g(L) are in agreement with the

optimally-doped BSCCO, TBCO, HBCO, LSCO and YBCO single crystals. To best fit
the experimental data, the scattering by non-magnetic impurities has to be
taken into account, thus limiting the sensitivity of this procedure in
determining the exact gap symmetry of these materials. Finally, the effect of
the temperature on the theoretical tunneling conductance is also discussed and
the curves obtained at T=2 K are compared to those given by the analytical

is important is the shape of the whole envelope. Typically a huge amount of

paper we present a methodology aimed at systematically exploring this envelope.
We propose a method for searching for tendencies and proving their necessity
relative to a range of parameterisations of the model and agents' choices, and
to the logic of the simulation language. The exploration consists of a forward
chaining generation of the trajectories associated to and constrained by such a
range of parameterisations and choices. Additionally, we propose a
computational procedure that helps implement this exploration by translating a
Multi Agent System simulation into a constraint-based search over possible
trajectories by 'compiling' the simulation rules into a more specific form,
namely by partitioning the simulation rules using appropriate modularity in the
simulation. An example of this procedure is exhibited.

decoupling limit. Analytic expressions in the large SUSY mass region are
derived and the decoupling behavior of the corrections is examined in various
limiting cases, where some or all of the SUSY mass parameters become large. We
show that in the decoupling limit of large SUSY mass parameters and large
CP-odd Higgs mass, the $h^0 b \bar b$ coupling approaches its Standard Model
value at one loop. However, the onset of decoupling is delayed when $\tan\beta$
is large. In addition, the one-loop SUSY-QCD corrections decouple if the masses
of either the bottom squarks or the gluino are separately taken large; although
the approach to decoupling is significantly slower in the latter case.

Babu's two-loop mechanism. This allows us to incorporate ``just so''

exclusively to a non-zero $ee$ matrix element.

photons and selected the diagrams which have a $\Delta$ in the final state. The
agreement found with the $\gamma_v p\to\Delta^0\pi^+$ and $\gamma_v
p\to\Delta^{++}\pi^-$ reactions is good. The sensitivity of the results to
$N\Delta$ transition form factors is also studied. The present reaction,
selecting a particular final state, is an extra test for models of the
$\gamma_{v} N\to \pi\pi N$ amplitude.

Carnot constructed such a reversible heat engine by combining adiabatic and
isothermal processes for a system containing an ideal gas. Here, we present an
example of a cyclic engine based on a single quantum-mechanical particle
confined to a potential well. The efficiency of this engine is shown to equal
the Carnot efficiency because quantum dynamics is reversible. The quantum heat
engine has a cycle consisting of adiabatic and isothermal quantum processes
that are close analogues of the corresponding classical processes.

spontaneous emission from a thermal reservoir is analyzed. We consider the case
of atoms with a three-level $\Lambda$ scheme, in which one of the atomic
transitions has a very much shorter life-time than the other one. We found that
in such scenario the photon reabsorption in dense clouds can be considered
negligible. If in addition inelastic processes can be neglected, we find that
optical pumping can be used to continuously load and refill Bose-Einstein
condensates, i.e. provides a possible way to achieve a continuous atom laser.

to a realistic system, of phase control of photoabsorption in an optically
dense medium. We demonstrate that, when propagation effects are taken into
consideration, the impact on phase control is significant. Independently of the
value of the initial phase difference between the two fields, over a short
scaled distance of propagation, the medium tends to settle the relative phase
so that it cancels the atomic excitation. In addition, we find some rather
unusual behavior for an optically thin layer.
