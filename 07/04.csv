very accurate galaxy shape estimation and a careful treatment of systematic

observational effects including atmospheric seeing, PSF anisotropy and
pixelisation, incorporated in a manner to reproduce actual observations with
the William Herschel Telescope. By applying an artificial shear to the
simulated images, we test the shear measurement method proposed by Kaiser,
Squires & Broadhurst (1995, KSB). Overall, we find the KSB method to be
reliable with several provisos. To guide future weak lensing surveys, we study
how seeing size, exposure time and pixelisation affect the sensitivity to
shear. In addition, we study the impact of overlapping isophotes of neighboring
galaxies, and find that this effect can produce spurious lensing signals on
small scales. We discuss the prospects of using the KSB method for future, more
sensitive, surveys. Numerical simulations of this kind are a required component

M_sun in order to evaluate the binding energy of the envelope to the core prior
to mass transfer in close binary systems. This binding energy is expressed by a
parameter lambda which is crucial for determining the outcome of binaries
evolving through a common envelope (CE) and spiral-in phase. We discuss the
lambda-parameter and the efficiency of envelope ejection in the CE-phase, and
show that lambda depends strongly on the evolutionary stage (i.e. stellar
radius) of the donor star at the onset of the mass transfer. The existence of
this relation enables us to introduce a new approach for solving the energy
equation. For a given observed binary system we can derive a unique solution
for the original mass and age of the donor star, as well as the pre-CE orbital
period. We find that the value of lambda is typically between 0.2 and 0.8. But
in some cases, particularly on the asymptotic giant branch of lower-mass stars,
it is possible that lambda > 5. A high value of lambda (rather than assuming a
high efficiency parameter, eta_CE >1) is sufficient to explain the long final
orbital periods observed among those binary millisecond pulsars which are
believed to have evolved through a CE-phase. We also present a tabulation of
lambda as a function of stellar radius and mass, which is useful for a quick
estimation of the orbital decay during a common envelope and spiral-in phase.

codes with different algorithms, TVD and ZEUS-3D. The outcome of the numerical
experiments performed with both codes is very similar, and confirms the results
of the linear analysis for the undular mode derived by Kim et al. (2000): the
most unstable wavelength is about 3 kpc and its growth timescale is between
30-50 Myr (the growth rate is sensitive to the position of the upper boundary
of the numerical grid). Thus, the time and length scales of this multicomponent
disk model are substantially larger than those derived for thin disk models. We
use three different types of perturbations, random, symmetric, and
antisymmetric, to trigger the instability. The antisymmetric mode is dominant,
and determines the minimum time for the onset of the nonlinear regime. The
instability generates dense condensations and the final peak column density
value in the antisymmetric case, as also derived by Kim et al. (2000), is about
a factor of 3 larger than its initial value. These wavelengths and density

Iota Orionis obtained at periastron and apastron. Based on the assumption of a
strong colliding winds shock between the stellar components, we expected to see
significant variation in the X-ray emission between these phases. The
observations proved otherwise: the X-ray luminosities and spectral
distributions were remarkably similar. The only noteworthy feature was the hint
of a proximity effect during periastron passage, supported also in the optical.
We discuss the accuracy of our results, and also analyse archival ROSAT
observations. We investigate why we do not see a clear colliding winds
signature. A simple model shows that the wind attenuation to the expected
position of the shock apex is negligible throughout the orbit, which poses the
puzzling question of why the expected 1/D variation (ie. a factor of 7.5) in
the intrinsic luminosity is not seen in the data. Two scenarios are proposed:
either the colliding winds emission is unexpectedly weak such that intrinsic
shocks in the winds dominate the emission, or, alternatively, that the emission
observed is colliding winds emission but in a more complex form than we would
naively expect. Complex hydrodynamical models are then analyzed. Despite
strongly phase-variable emission from the models, both were consistent with the
observations. We find that if the mass-loss rates of the stars are low then
intrinsic wind shocks could dominate the emission. However, when we assume
higher mass-loss rates of the stars, we find that the observed emission could
also be consistent with a purely colliding winds origin. To distinguish between

$\alpha\lesssim 0.1$, the dynamics of non-radiating accretion flows is
dominated by convection; convection strongly suppresses the accretion of matter
onto the central object and transports a luminosity $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2} \dot
M c^2$ from small to large radii in the flow. A fraction of this convective
luminosity is likely to be radiated at large radii via thermal bremsstrahlung
emission. We show that this leads to a correlation between the frequency of
maximal bremsstrahlung emission and the luminosity of the source, $\nu_{\rm
peak} \propto L^{2/3}$. Accreting black holes with X-ray luminosities $10^{-4}
L_{Edd}\gtrsim L_X(0.5-10{\rm keV}) \gtrsim 10^{-7}L_{Edd}$ are expected to
have hard X-ray spectra, with photon indices $\Gamma\sim2$, and sources with
$L_X\lesssim 10^{-9}L_{Edd}$ are expected to have soft spectra, with
$\Gamma\sim3.5$. This is testable with {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM}.

perfectly agrees with the experimental points. We also solved the real-axis

masses. If, in addition, a B-L gauge symmetry broken at a large scale M_G is
introduced, a wider range of possibilities opens up. The value of the
right-handed neutrino mass M_R can be easily disentangled from that of M_G.
Dirac and Majorana neutrino masses at the eV scale can be generated radiatively
through the exchange of sneutrinos and neutralinos. Dirac masses m_D owe their
smallness to the pattern of light-heavy scales in the neutralino mass matrix.
The smallness of the Majorana masses m_L is linked to a similar see-saw pattern
in the sneutrino mass matrix. Two distinct scenarios emerge. In the first, with
very small or vanishing M_R, the physical neutrino eigenstates are, for each
generation, either two light Majorana states with mixing angle ranging from
very small to maximal, depending on the ratio m_D/M_R, or one light Dirac
state. In the second scenario, with a large value of M_R, the physical
eigenstates are two nearly unmixed Majorana states with masses \sim m_L and
\sim M_R. In both cases, the (B-L)-breaking scale M_G is, in general, much
smaller than that in the traditional see-saw mechanism.

B31 (2000) 2269-2276",,,"nucl-th hep-ph nucl-ex",,"  A model for the description of photonuclear reactions in the multi-GeV range
is described that combines the coherent initial state interactions (shadowing)
of the incoming photon with an incoherent coupled channel description of final
state interactons of outgoing particles. Particle production itself is treated
either, at low energies, through nucleon resonance decays or, at higher
energies, through string fragmentation. The initial state nucleons can be
far-off-shell due to ground state correlations. Results are shown for
semi-inclusive meson production.

  been rejected by the author. A consistent formulation see in arXiv:0705.2585",,,,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc",,"  The strong proper time dilation and radial contraction in the gravitational
field of compact sources leads to a frozen state of matter. It is shown that
the falling particles and photons can not cross the gravitational radius due to
the freezing, the horizon and singularity can not be formed at any finite
coordinate time moment t=const. As the result, general relativity really
predicts the heavy baryonic and quark stars and quasars instead of the black
holes. A model of the oscillating Universe without a cosmological singularity,
having a new type of the cosmological redshift, is considered. The
regularizations of loop divergencies in quantum field theory also can be
explained as the gravitational effects.

Stark effect of Rydberg atoms embedded in the ion clouds. The ion clouds are
produced by UV photoionization of laser-cooled rubidium atoms in a
magneto-optic trap. In very dense ion clouds, the Rydberg atom excitation
spectra reflect the presence of a neutral plasma core and a positively charged

of the Bell inequality is exhibited in the light of the n-particle Bell-type
inequality discovered by Mermin [PRL 65, 1838 (1990)]. It is shown, in

predicted by quantum mechanics decreases exponentially by a factor of 2^{-m/2}
whenever any m among the n single-particle commutators happen to vanish.

where the damping rate \gamma is comparable to the system frequency \Omega,
i.e., \gamma \sim \Omega, whereas the usual stochastic limit approximation is
applied only to the weak damping situation \gamma << \Omega. The key formulas
for rapid decay are very similar to those for weak damping, but the dynamics is
quite different. From a microscopic Hamiltonian, the spin-boson model, a Bloch
equation containing two independent time scales is derived. This is a useful
method to extract the minimal dissipative dynamics at high temperature kT >>
\hbar\Omega and the master equations obtained are of the Lindblad form even for
the Caldeira-Leggett model. The validity of the method is confirmed by
comparing the master equation derived through this method with the exact one.
