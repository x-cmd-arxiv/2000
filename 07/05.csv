observed data in local and distant (z approx 0.4) samples. We measure the
surface brightness profiles of the 20 brightest early-type galaxies of
CL0949+44 (hereafter CL0949) at redshift z=0.35-0.38 from HST WF2 frames taken
in the filters F555W, F675W, F814W. We determine the color profiles (V-R)(r),
(V-I)(r), and (R-I)(r) as a function of the radial distance r in arcsec, and
fit logarithmic gradients in the range -0.2 to 0.1 mag per decade. These values
are similar to what is found locally for the colors (U-B), (U-V), (B-V) which
approximately match the (V-R), (V-I), (R-I) at redshift approx 0.4. We analyse
the results with up to date stellar population models. We find that passive
evolution of metallicity gradients (approx 0.2 dex per radial decade) provides
a consistent explanation of the local and distant galaxies' data. Invoking pure
age gradients (with fixed metallicity) to explain local color gradients
produces too steep gradients at redshifts z approx 0.4. Pure age gradients are
consistent with the data only if large present day ages (>=15 Gyr) are assumed
for the galaxy centers.

electron density, ionization) and the spatial distribution of the nebular gas.
An electron temperature of 11500 K and a turbulence of 18 km/s are derived by
comparing the Halpha and [OIII] emission line profiles, but large, small scale
fluctuations of both these quantities are present in the ionized gas. The
radial density distribution shows external peaks up to 1400 cm-3; they have
steep outwards profiles and extended inwards tails probably originated by
Rayleigh-Taylor instability and winds interaction. The complexity of the
expanding motions indicates that the main part of NGC 1501 is a thin ellipsoid
of moderate ellipticity, but the presence of a pair of large lobes along both
the major and the intermediate axes and of a multitude of smaller bumps spread
on the whole nebular surface, makes the general 3-D structure of NGC 1501 like
a boiling, tetra-lobed shell. This peculiar morphology can be qualitatively
explained in terms of interaction of the slow nebular material with the intense

wings have been found in the subtracted H_alpha profile of the very active star
HU Vir. These profiles are well matched using a two-component Gaussian fit
(narrow and broad) and the broad component can be interpreted as arising from
microflaring. Red-shifted absorption features in the H_alpha line have been
detected in several systems and excess emission in the blue wing of FG UMa was
also detected. These features indicate that several dynamical processes, or a
combination of them, may be involved. Using the E(H_alpha)/E(H_beta) ratio as a
diagnostic we have detected prominence-like extended material viewed off the
limb in many stars of the sample, and prominences viewed against the disk at
some orbital phases in the dwarfs OU Gem and BF Lyn. The He I D_3 line has been
detected as an absorption feature in mainly all the giants of the sample. Total
filling-in of the He I D_3, probably due to microflaring activity, is observed
in HU Vir. Self-absorption with red asymmetry is detected in the Ca II H & K

clear filled-in Ca II IRT lines or even notable emission reversal. The small

is the dark halo spin parameter and j_d/m_d is the ratio between the specific
angular momentum of the disk and that of the dark halo. The distribution of
lambda' is in excellent agreement with cosmological predictions of hierarchical
clustering if j_d/m_d=1, that is if the protogalactic gas did not loose a
significant amount of specific angular momentum due to dynamical friction. This
result is in disagreement with current cosmological Nbody/SPH simulations where
the baryonic component looses 90% of its specific angular momentum while
settling into the equatorial plane. The Swaters sample also shows a
surprisingly strong correlation between lambda' and the baryonic mass fraction
m_d: lambda'=0.4 m_d**0.6. This correlation can be explained if the total
amount of gas in protogalaxies is a universal fraction of their dark matter
mass, of order 10%, and if the variation in m_d is a result of the fact that
only the inner parts of the primordial gas distribution managed to form a
visible disk component. In this case the specific angular momentum of the gas
out of which the disk formed is a factor of 2.75 larger than that of the dark
halo, which would require a yet unknown spin-up process for the visible

inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background photons and can thereby
produce the observed intensity and spectrum of the diffuse gamma-ray
background. Here we calculate the intensity and angular fluctuations of the
radio synchrotron background that results from the same high-energy electrons,
as well as the expected angular fluctuations in the gamma-ray background. On
angular scales smaller than a degree, the predicted fluctuations in the
microwave background temperature are of order 40micro-K*(xi_B/0.01)(nu/10
GHz)^{-3}, where xi_B is the magnetic fraction of the post-shock energy
density. This foreground might have already dominated the anisotropy signal
detected in existing low-frequency CMB experiments, and can be identified with
confidence through multi-frequency observations. Detection of the synchrotron
fluctuations would allow to determine the strength of the intergalactic
magnetic field. We predict a strong correlation between high-resolution maps
taken at low-frequency radio waves and at high-energy gamma-rays. Young X-ray

metallic with a single Cu x2-y2/O p(sigma) band crossing the Fermi level. Under

band structure has a spin polarized antiferromagnetic solution with a band gap
of 2.0 eV, agreeing well with experiment. This state is 1.0 eV (per formula
unit) lower than that calculated from the R-B3LYP. The apparent high energy of
the spin restricted state is attributed to an overestimate of on-site Coulomb
repulsion which is corrected in the unrestricted spin calculations. The
stabilization of the total energy with spin polarization arises primarily from
the stabilization of the x2-y2 band, such that the character of the eigenstates
at the top of the valence band in the antiferromagnetic state becomes a strong
mixture of Cu x2-y2/O p(sigma) and Cu z2/O' p(z). Since the Hohenberg-Kohn
theorem requires the spin restricted and spin unrestricted calculations give
exactly the same ground state energy and total density for the exact
functionals, this large disparity in energy reflects the inadequacy of current
functionals for describing the cuprates. This calls into question the use of

diagrams in the perturbation expansion around harmonic theory are not included

However, this gives an unsatisfactory comparison to numerical results on the

We derive an improved self-consistent method, the two-vertex-SCHA, which gives

automatic test generation algorithms for multipoint protocols. These algorithms
attempt to synthesize network topologies and sequences of events that stress
the protocol's correctness or performance. This problem can be viewed as a
domain-specific search problem that suffers from the state space explosion
problem. One goal of this work is to circumvent the state space explosion
problem utilizing knowledge of network and fault modeling, and multipoint
protocols. The two approaches investigated in this study are based on forward
and backward search techniques. We use an extended finite state machine (FSM)
model of the protocol. The first algorithm uses forward search to perform
reduced reachability analysis. Using domain-specific information for multicast
routing over LANs, the algorithm complexity is reduced from exponential to
polynomial in the number of routers. This approach, however, does not fully
automate topology synthesis. The second algorithm, the fault-oriented test
generation, uses backward search for topology synthesis and uses backtracking
to generate event sequences instead of searching forward from initial states.
Using these algorithms, we have conducted studies for correctness of the
multicast routing protocol PIM. We propose to extend these algorithms to study
end-to-end multipoint protocols using a virtual LAN that represents delays of
the underlying multicast distribution tree.

simplest domain wall has the structure of a kink across which the Higgs field
changes sign ($\Phi \to -\Phi$) and inside which the full SU(5) is restored.
The kink is shown to be perturbatively unstable for all parameters. We then
construct a domain wall solution that is lighter than the kink and show it to
be perturbatively stable for a range of parameters. The symmetry in the core of
this domain wall is smaller than that outside. The interactions of the domain
wall with magnetic monopole is discussed and it is shown that magnetic
monopoles with certain internal space orientations relative to the wall pass
through the domain wall. Magnetic monopoles in other relative internal space
orientations are likely to be swept away on collision with the domain walls,
suggesting a scenario where the domain walls might act like optical
polarization filters, allowing certain monopole ``polarizations'' to pass
through but not others. As SU(5) domain walls will also be formed at small
values of the cubic coupling, this leads to a very complicated picture of the
evolution of defects after the Grand Unified phase transition.

Weyl-invariant spinning polynomial membrane action, without curvature
terms,where $both$ the conformal boost symmetry and $S$-supersymmetry are
explicitly broken by the action. It is shown that the gauge algebra $closes$
despite that the two latter symmetries are broken . For this to happen, a
modifed $Q$-supersymmetry transformation, a sort of new $Q+K+S$ ``sum `` rule,

contributions fromthe $S$ and conformal boost anomalous transformations. A
substantial discussion of the quantization of the spinning membrane and
anomalies is given. We review briefly the role that this spinning membrane

$B\gg Z^2$. In Region 1 standard Hartree theory is applicable. Region 3 is
described by a one-dimensional functional, which is identical to the so-called
Hyper-Strong functional introduced by Lieb, Solovej and Yngvason for atoms with
fermionic electrons in the region $B\gg Z^3$; i.e., for very strong magnetic
fields the ground state properties of atoms are independent of statistics. For
Region 2 we introduce a general {\it magnetic Hartree functional}, which is
studied in detail. It is shown that in the special case of an atom it can be
restricted to the subspace of zero angular momentum parallel to the magnetic

the degrees of its generators has attracted considerable interest, brought into
focus by the influential survey of Bayer and Mumford. The present paper
examines some of these results and questions from a geometric perspective.
Specifically, motivated by work of Paoletti we introduce an invariant s(I) that
measures the ""positivity"" of an ideal sheaf I. Degree bounds on generators of I
yield bounds on this s-invariant, but s(I) may be small even when the degrees
of its generators are large. We prove that s(I) computes the asymptotic
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of large powers of I, and bounds the asymptotic
behavior of several other measures of complexity. We also show that this
s-invariant behaves very well with respect to natural geometric and algebraic
operations, which leads to considerably simplified constructions of varieties
with irrational asymptotic regularity. The main tools are intersection theory
and vanishing theorems.

In higher latitudes the delay goes as long as 15 min. On the nightside these

  spectrum","42 pages, 20 figures, abstract shortened",,"10.1017/S0022112001003718",,"physics.flu-dyn astro-ph cond-mat nlin.PS",,"  We investigate the asymptotic properties of inertial modes confined in a
spherical shell when viscosity tends to zero. We first consider the mapping
made by the characteristics of the hyperbolic equation (Poincar\'e's equation)
satisfied by inviscid solutions. Characteristics are straight lines in a
meridional section of the shell, and the mapping shows that, generically, these
lines converge towards a periodic orbit which acts like an attractor.
  We then examine the relation between this characteristic path and
eigensolutions of the inviscid problem and show that in a purely
two-dimensional problem, convergence towards an attractor means that the
associated velocity field is not square-integrable. We give arguments which
generalize this result to three dimensions. We then consider the viscous
problem and show how viscosity transforms singularities into internal shear
layers which in general betray an attractor expected at the eigenfrequency of
the mode. We find that there are nested layers, the thinnest and most internal
layer scaling with $E^{1/3}$-scale, $E$ being the Ekman number. Using an
inertial wave packet traveling around an attractor, we give a lower bound on
the thickness of shear layers and show how eigenfrequencies can be computed in
principle. Finally, we show that as viscosity decreases, eigenfrequencies tend
towards a set of values which is not dense in $[0,2\Omega]$, contrary to the
case of the full sphere ($\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the system).
Hence, our geometrical approach opens the possibility of describing the
eigenmodes and eigenvalues for astrophysical/geophysical Ekman numbers
($10^{-10}-10^{-20}$), which are out of reach numerically, and this for a wide
class of containers.

long term stability by extrapolation. The survival function is a function of
the initial coordinates and is the number of turns a particle will survive for
a given set of initial coordinates. To determine the difficulties in
extrapolating the survival function, tracking studies were done to compute the
survival function. The survival function was found to have two properties that
may cause difficulties in extrapolating the survival function. One is the
existence of rapid oscillations, and the second is the existence of plateaus.
It was found that it appears possible to extrapolate the survival function to
estimate long term stability by taking the two difficulties into account. A
model is proposed which pictures the survival function to be a series of
plateaus with rapid oscillations superimposed on the plateaus. The tracking
studies give results for the widths of these plateaus and for the seperation
between adjacent plateaus which can be used to extrapolate and estimate the
location of plateaus that indicate survival for longer times than can be found
by tracking.

  figures available at http://www.cst.ku.dk/bart/eps/",,,,"quant-ph",,"  EPR correlations exist and can be observed independently of any a priori
given frame of reference. We can even construct a frame of reference that is

equivalent to the customary a priori given frame of reference of the laboratory
when describing real EPR experiments. J.S. Bell has argued that local hidden
parameter theories that reproduce the predictions of Quantum Mechanics cannot
exist, but the counterfactual reasoning leading to Bell's conclusion is
physically meaningless if the frame of reference that is based on
EPR-correlations is accepted as the backdrop for EPR-type experiments. The
refutal of Bell's proof opens up for the construction of a viable hidden
parameter theory. A model of a spin h/2 particle in terms of a non-flat metric
of space-time is shown to be able to reproduce the predictions of quantum
mechanics in the Bohm-Aharonov version of the EPR experiment, without
introducing non-locality.
