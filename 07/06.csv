during the summer of 1998. This activity peaked on August 27, 1998 when a giant
periodic gamma-ray flare resembling the famous March 5, 1979 event from SGR
0526-66 was recorded. Two days later (August 29), a strong, bright burst was
detected with RXTE and BATSE. This event reveals several similarities to the
giant flares of August 27 and March 5, and shows a number of unique features
not previously seen in SGR bursts. Unlike typically short SGR bursts, this
event features a 3.5 s burst peak that was preceded by an extended (~ 1 s)
complex precursor, and followed by a long (~ 1000 s) periodic tail modulated at
the 5.16 s stellar rotation period. Spectral analysis shows a striking
distinction between the spectral behavior of the precursor, burst peak and
extended tail. While the spectrum during the peak is uniform, a significant
spectral evolution is detected in both the precursor and tail emissions.
Temporal behavior shows a sharp rise (~ 9.8 ms) at the event onset and a rapid
cutoff (~ 17 ms) at the end of the burst peak. The tail pulsations show a
simple pulse profile consisting of one 5.16 s peak that did not evolve with
time. The spectral and temporal signatures of this event imply that the
precursor, main peak, and extended tail are produced by different physical
mechanisms. We discuss these features and their implications in the context of
the magnetar model. The energetics of the August 29 event, and its close
proximity to the August 27 flare, suggest that it is an `aftershock' of the
preceding giant flare. ""P.S. This is an abbreviated version of the original

  10, 2000 issue of ApJ",,"10.1086/317125",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate synchrotron emission models as the source of gamma-ray burst
spectra. We show that including the possibility for synchrotron
self-absorption, a ``smooth cutoff'' to the electron energy distribution, and
an anisotropic distribution for the electron pitch angles produces a whole
range of low energy spectral behavior. In addition, we show that the procedure
of spectral fitting to GRB data over a finite bandwidth can introduce a
spurious correlation between spectral parameters - in particular, the value of
the peak of the nu F_nu spectrum, E_p, and the low energy photon spectral index
alpha (the lower E_p is, the lower (softer) the fitted value of alpha will be).
  From this correlation and knowledge of the E_p distribution, we show how to
derive the expected distribution of alpha. We show that optically thin
synchrotron models with an isotropic electron pitch angle distribution can
explain the distribution of alpha below alpha=-2/3. This agreement is achieved
if we relax the unrealistic assumption of the presence of a sharp low energy
cutoff in the spectrum of accelerated electrons, and allow for a more gradual
break. We show that this low energy portion of the electron spectrum can be at
most flat. We also show that optically thin synchrotron models with an
anisotropic electron pitch angle distribution can explain all bursts with -2/3
< alpha <= 0$. The very few bursts with low energy spectral indices that fall
above alpha=0 may be due the presence of a the synchrotron self-absorption
frequency entering the lower end of the BATSE window. Our results also predict
a particular relationship between alpha and E_p during the temporal evolution
of a GRB. We give examples of spectral evolution in GRBs and discuss how the

central galaxies of 3 clusters of galaxies purported to host massive cooling
flows, NGC1275, A2597, and PKS0745. The spectral signature of vibrationally-
excited molecular hydrogen (VEMH) has been seen in every galaxy searched so far
in a cluster cooling flow with an optical emission line nebula. We have
discovered that the VEMH gas extends several kpc from the centers of A2597 and
PKS0745, while the vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen in NGC1275 appears
to be mostly confined to its nucleus, with some extended emission <1 kpc from
the center. The VEMH in A2597 and PKS0745-191 seems to be nearly co-spatial
with the optical emission-line filaments in those systems. Candidates for
heating the nebulae are X-ray irradiation by the ICM, UV fluorescence by young
stars, and shocks. UV heating by young stars provides the most satisfactory
explanation for the H2 emission in A2597 and PKS0745; X-ray irradiation is
energetically unlikely and strong shocks (v>40 km/s) are ruled out by the high
H2/H-alpha ratios. If UV heating is the main energy input, a few billion solar
masses of molecular gas is present in A2597 and PKS0745. UV irradiation models
predict a significant amount of 1-2 micron emission from higher excitation H2
transitions and moderate far infrared luminosities (~1e44/h^2 erg/s) for A2597
and PKS0745. Even in the context of UV fluorescence models, the total amount of
H2 gas and star formation inferred from these observations is too small to
account for the cooling flow rates and longevities inferred from the X-rays. We
note an interesting new constraint on cooling flow models: the radio sources do
not provide a significant amount of shock heating, and therefore cannot
counterbalance the cooling of the X-ray gas in the cluster cores.

[Fe/H] <= 0 dex. There is evidence of a radial metallicity gradient in the
globular cluster system, which is steeper than that seen in the underlying
starlight. Determination of the absolute ages of the globular clusters is
uncertain, but formally, the metal-poor population of globular clusters has an
age of 14.5 +/- 4 Gyr and the metal-rich population is 13.8 +/- 6 Gyr old.
Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the globular cluster populations present
in these data are older than 6 Gyr at the 95% confidence level. We find that
within the uncertainties, the globular clusters are old and coeval, implying
that the bimodality seen in the broadband colours primarily reflects
metallicity and not age differences.

analytical self-similar solutions: a two-temperature solution which is valid in
an inner zone, r<10^{2.5}, where r is the radius in Schwarzchild units; and a
one-temperature solution which is valid in an outer zone, r>10^{2.5}. In both
zones the density varies as \rho ~ r^{-2} and the angular velocity as \Omega ~
r^{-3/2}. We solve the flow equations numerically and confirm that the
analytical solutions are accurate. The settling flow radiates the energy
dissipated by viscosity; so it is not advection-dominated. Except for the
radial velocity, all other gas properties - density, angular velocity,
temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux - are independent of the mass
accretion rate; these quantities do depend sensitively on the spin of the
neutron star. The angular momentum flux is outward under most conditions;
therefore, the central star is nearly always spun-down. The luminosity of the
settling zone arises from the rotational energy that is released as the star is
braked by viscosity, and the contribution from gravity is small; hence the
radiative efficiency can be arbitrarily large at low $\mdot$. For reasonable
values of the gas adiabatic index, the Bernoulli parameter is negative;
therefore, a strong outflow or wind is not expected. The flow is convectively
stable, but may be thermally unstable. The described solution is not
advection-dominated; however, when the spin of the star is small enough, it
transforms smoothly to an advection-dominated branch of solution.

investigate the shielding performance of the experiment by means of a geometric

far-field diffraction effects give way to near-field ones. Due to the
asymmetric response of the feeds, the orientation of their radiation fields

most prominent components. We determine the projected speed with which these
two components recede from each other to be 0.12+/-0.02 h^-1 c. Given the
projected separation of the two components of 16.1 h^-1 pc, the infered
kinematic age is 440+/-80 years, measured in the source reference frame. These
results provide additional support for the contention that compact symmetric
radio objects are young and the precursors of the classical FR I or FR II radio
sources. The sizes of individual components appear to contract with time which
is not consistent with the self-similar evolution model for peaked spectrum
sources.
  In order to overcome problems related to the estimation of uncertainties for
separation measurements between source components, we have developed and
applied a method that compares two uv-data sets obtained at different epochs.
This method parametrizes the most important structural change, the increase in
separation between components, by rescaling the u and v axis of the amplitude
interference pattern. It provides best-fit values for the parameters and uses a
bootstrap method to estimate the errors in the parameters.

excitation mode above a magnetic domain wall is gapless, whereas all of the
usual spin wave excitations moving around the whole crystal are gapful.
Although this surprising fact was already proved in a mathematically rigorous
manner, the gapless excitations have not yet been detected experimentally. For
this issue, we show theoretically that the gapless excitations appear as the
dynamical fluctuations of the experimental observable, magnetoresistance, in a
ferromagnetic wire. We also discuss other methods (e.g., ferromagnetic
resonance and neutron scattering) to detect the gapless excitations

space interferometric observations must rely upon the theory of
general-relativistic transformations between the spacecraft, geocentric, and
solar barycentric reference systems allowing unique and unambiguous
interpretation of the stellar aberration and parallax effects. On the other
hand, the algorithm must also include physically adequate treatment of the
relativistic effect of light deflection caused by the spherically-symmetric
(monopole-dependent) part of the gravitational field of the Sun and planets as
well as the quadrupole- and spin-dependent counterparts of it. In some
particular cases the gravitomagnetic field induced by the translational motion
of the Sun and planets should be also taken into account for unambigious
prediction of the light-ray deflection angle. In the present paper we describe
the corresponding software program for taking into account all classical
(proper motion, parallax, etc.) and relativistic (aberration, deflection of
light) effects up to the microarcsecond threshold and demonstrate, using
numerical simulations, how observations of stars and/or quasars conducted on

$\bar B\to X_u \ell\bar\nu$ decay yields a model independent determination of
$|V_{ub}|$. Unlike the lepton energy and hadronic invariant mass spectra,
nonperturbative effects are only important in the resonance region, and play a
parametrically suppressed role when $d\Gamma / dq^2$ is integrated over $q^2 >
(m_B-m_D)^2$, which is required to eliminate the $\bar B\to X_c \ell\bar\nu$
background. We discuss these backgrounds for $q^2$ slightly below
$(m_B-m_D)^2$, and point out that instead of $q^2 > (m_B-m_D)^2 = 11.6 GeV^2$,
the cut can be lowered to $q^2 \gtrsim 10.5 GeV^2$. This is important
experimentally, particularly when effects of a finite neutrino reconstruction
resolution are included.

be the same up to NLO among the six factorization schemes examined. In

weak decay of a B^* (J^P=1^-) or B_0 (J^P=0^+) off-shell meson. In particular,
for the B decay channel, the inclusion of the B_0 pole completes some previous
analyses and confirms their conclusions, provided a suitable cut in the Dalitz
plot is performed; for the B_s decay the inclusion of the B^*, B_0 amplitudes
enhances the role of the tree diagrams as compared to penguin amplitudes, which
makes the theoretical uncertainty related to the B_s => rho^0 K_S decay process
less significant. While the first method is affected by theoretical
uncertainties, the second one is cleaner, but its usefulness will depend on the

with two charged-particle multidetectors covering more than 80% of the solid
angle. The hard-photon spectra of the three heavier targets result from the
combination of two distinct exponential distributions with different slope
parameters, a result which deviates from the behaviour expected for hard-photon
production just in first-chance proton-neutron collisions. The thermal origin
of the steeper bremsstrahlung component is confirmed by the characteristics of
its slope and angular distribution. Such thermal hard-photons convey
undisturbed information of the thermodynamical state of hot and excited nuclear
systems undergoing multifragmentation.

be transiently produced if normal hadronic matter is subjected to sufficiently
high temperature and/or density. We have investigated the possibility of QGP
formation in the ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions through the
electromagnetic probes - photons and dileptons. The formulation of the real and
virtual photon production rate from strongly interacting matter is studied in
the framework of Thermal Field Theory. Since signals from the QGP will pick up
large backgrounds from hadronic matter we have performed a detailed study of
the changes in the hadronic properties induced by temperature within the ambit
of the Quantum Hadrodynamic model, gauged linear and non-linear sigma models,
hidden local symmetry approach and QCD sum rule approach. The possibility of
observing the direct thermal photons and lepton pairs from quark gluon plasma
has been contrasted with that from hot hadronic matter with and without medium
effects for various mass variation scenarios. The effects of medium induced
modifications have also been incorporated in the evolution dynamics through the
equation of state. We find that the in-medium effects on the hadronic
properties in the framework of the Quantum Hadrodynamic model, Brown-Rho
scaling and Nambu scaling scenarios are conspicuously visible through the low
invariant mass distribution of dileptons and transverse momentum spectra of
photons. We have compared our evaluation of the photon and dilepton spectra
with experimental data obtained by the WA80, WA98 and CERES Collaborations in
the heavy ion experiments performed at the CERN SPS. Predictions of
electromagnetic spectra for RHIC energies have also been made.

the nucleus was the most exciting frontier of science. To establish her career,
she had to overcome daunting prejudices against women in science and academia.
Being of Jewish origin in Germany in the 1930's, she narrowly escaped certain
disaster. Meitner was a crucial participant in the discovery of nuclear
fission, yet did not share in the Nobel Prize that her collaborator, Otto Hahn,
received in 1945. How these events came about, how they were intertwined with
contemporary history and how they fit into the evolution of Meitner's social
conscience and her abhorrence of war are some of the fascinating subjects
