modelling the MECS radial profile in several energy bands, the optical depth to
dust scattering at 1 keV was found to be 2.4+/-0.4. The non-dip and dip spectra
of X1624-490 in the energy band 1-100 keV are well-described by emission
consisting of a point-like blackbody from the neutron star plus extended
Comptonized emission from an ADC. The blackbody temperature was 1.31+/-0.07 keV
and the Comptonized emission had photon power law index 2.0+0.5/-0.7 and
cut-off energy ~12 keV. Good fits to the dip spectra were obtained by allowing
the Comptonized emission to be progressively covered by an extended absorber
while the blackbody was rapidly absorbed and a constant halo component
accounted for dust scattering into the line-of-sight. From the dip ingress
time, a diameter of the extended Comptonized emission region of 5.3+/-0.8x10^10
cm was derived, consistent with a hot, X-ray emitting corona extending to ~50%
of the accretion disk radius. The source luminosity for a distance of 15 kpc is
7.3x10^37 erg/s, an appreciable fraction of the Eddington limit making
X1624-490 the most luminous dipping LMXB. The half-height of the blackbody
emitting region on the neutron star of 6.8+/-1.8 km agrees well with the
half-height of the radiatively supported inner accretion disk of 6.3+/-2.9 km.
Together with similar agreement recently obtained for 13 other LMXB in an ASCA
survey (Church & Balucinska-Church 2000), this strongly supports the
identification of the neutron star as the origin of the blackbody emission in
LMXB and suggests a mechanism in which the disk height is the main factor
determining the level of blackbody emission. Finally, from RXTE ASM data, we
derive an improved orbital period of 20.87+/-0.01 hr.

a mystery. For one of these, 3EG J2227+6122, our complete census of X-ray and

incomplete radio shell with a flat radio spectrum, and a compact, power-law
X-ray source with photon index Gamma = 1.5 and with no obvious optical
counterpart. The radio shell is polarized at a level of 25%. The anomalous
properties of the radio source prevent us from deriving a completely
satisfactory theory as to its nature. Nevertheless, using data from ROSAT,
ASCA, the VLA, and optical imaging and spectroscopy, we argue that the X-ray
source may be a young pulsar with an associated wind-blown bubble or bow shock
nebula, and an example of the class of radio-quiet pulsars which are
hypothesized to comprise the majority of EGRET sources in the Galaxy. The
distance to this source can be estimated from its X-ray absorption as 3 kpc. At
this distance, the X-ray and gamma-ray luminosities would be 1.7x10^{33} and
3.7x10^{35} erg s^{-1}, respectively, which would require an energetic pulsar
to power them.
  If, on the contrary, this X-ray source is not the counterpart of 3EG

must be less than 10^{-4} of its gamma-ray luminosity, a condition not
satisfied by any established class of gamma-ray source counterpart. This would
require the existence of at least a quantitatively new type of EGRET source, as
has been suggested in studies of other EGRET fields.

between a central star cluster, the surrounding expanding HI shell, and
secondary star formation sites on the rim of the HI shell. Comparisons of the
far-UV (FUV, 1521 A), optical broad-band, H-alpha, X-ray, and HI morphologies
suggest that the region is in an auspicious moment of star formation triggered
by the central stellar cluster. The derived properties of the HI shell, the
central stellar cluster, and the star forming regions on the rim support this
scenario: The kinematic age of the HI shell is <14 Myr and in agreement with
the age of the central stellar cluster derived from the FUV observations (sim
11 Myr). An estimate for the mechanical energy input from SN and stellar winds
of the central stellar cluster made from FUV photometry and the derived cluster
age is 4.1 x 10^52 erg, roughly a few times higher than the kinetic energy of
the HI shell. The requisite energy input needed to create the HI shell, derived
in the `standard' fashion from the HI observations (using the numerical models
of Chevalier), is 2.6 x 10^53 erg which is almost an order of magnitude higher
than the estimated energy input as derived from the FUV data. Given the
overwhelming observational evidence that the central cluster is responsible for
the expanding HI shell, this discrepancy suggests that the required energy
input is overestimated using the `standard' method. This may explain why some
other searches for remnant stellar clusters in giant HI holes have been
unsuccessful so far. Our observations also show that stellar clusters are
indeed able to create supergiant HI shells, even at large galactocentric radii,
a scenario which has recently been questioned by a number of authors.

near the tip of the Stream (80 deg down-Stream of Fairall 9). For III Zw 2, the
lack of an accurate HI column density and the uncertain MgIII ionization

introduce a degenerate effect which means that Galactic structure models with
certain combinations of these parameters are indistinguishable from each other
in most directions. We present an analysis of the optimal directions in which
these degeneracies can be lifted. Poisson and magnitude errors are taken into
account, and an attempt is made to place an upper limit on the systematic error
due to separation of spheroid stars from thick/old disk stars. We find that the
magnitude range $20 < V < 21$ is the best for lifting most degeneracies, and
present the optimal combinations of directions using which this can be
achieved. We also give directions in which the signature of the presence of a
Galactic thick disk can be most readily identified, and the directions in which

solar wind-magnetosphere system remains one of the fundamental problems of
space physics.Recently, it has been realised that a new paradigm in physics,
that of Self Organised Criticality (SOC) may encapsulate the mixing and merging
of flux on many scales in the magnetotail prompting bursty energy release and
reconfiguration. SOC is consistent with qualitative measures such as power law
power spectra and bursty bulk flows and with more quantitative tests such as
power law burst distributions in auroral indices and auroral optical activity.
Here, we present a careful classification of the broad range of systems that
fall under the general description of ""SOC"". We argue that some, but not all,
of these are consistent with our current understanding of the magnetosphere. We
discuss the observed low dimensionality of the dynamic magnetosphere in terms
of both SOC model properties, and observables. Observations of burst statistics
are highlighted; we show that these are currently suggestive but not sufficient
to confirm SOC and in particular we find that auroral indices are not effective
at distinguishing the internal dynamics of the magnetosphere from that of the
intermittent solar wind driver. This may also elucidate the paradox of
predictability and complexity of the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere system.

based on the amplitude and the shape of the galaxy-galaxy correlation function,
$\xi_g(r)$, where $r$ is the separation of the galaxy pair. The second test
uses the mean relative peculiar velocity for galaxy pairs, $\vs(r)$. This
quantity is a measure of the rate of growth of clustering and it is related to
the two-point correlation function for the matter density fluctuations,
$\xi(r)$. Under the assumption that galaxies trace the mass ($\xi_g = \xi$),
the expected relative velocity can be calculated directly from the observed
galaxy clustering. The above assumption can be tested by confronting the
expected $\vs$ with direct measurements from velocity-distance surveys. Both
our methods are checked against N-body experiments and then compared with the
$\xi_g(r)$ and $\vs$ estimated from the {\sc APM} galaxy survey and the Mark
III catalogue, respectively. Our results suggest that cosmological density
parameter is low, $\Omega_m \approx 0.3$, and that the {\sc APM} galaxies trace
the mass at separations $r \ga 5 \Mlu$, where $h$ is the Hubble constant in
units of 100 km s$^{-1}$Mpc. The present results agree with earlier studies,
based on comparing higher order correlations in the {\sc APM} with weakly
non-linear perturbation theory. Both approaches constrain the linear bias
factor to be within 20% of unity. If the existence of the feature we identified
in the {\sc APM} $\xi_g(r)$ -- the inflection point near $\xi_g = 1$ -- is
confirmed by more accurate surveys, we may have discovered gravity's smoking
gun: the long awaited ``shoulder'' in $\xi$, generated by gravitational
dynamics and predicted by Gott and Rees 25 years ago.

becomes so efficient that at low accretion rates all matter flows via the
corona and proceeds towards the black hole as an advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF). We investigate this transition for accretion disks around stellar
black holes. We derive a set of four ordinary differential equations which
describe the relevant processes and solve them numerically. The evaporation
efficiency has a maximum value where the advection-dominated structure of the
corona (at large distances from the black hole) changes to a
radiation-dominated structure (at small distances). This maximum can be related
to the observed spectral transitions in black hole X-ray binaries. Our
solutions of coronal structure are valid for both, accretion in galactic X-ray
transients and in AGN.

new type of morphological instability, not leading to island break-down. For
strong electromigration, Monte Carlo simulations show that clusters then

investigated. We introduce and motivate the $q$-model via its application
proposed by Coppersmith {\em et al.} to the flow of stress through granular
matter at rest. For a special value of its parameters the $q$-model has a
critical point that we analyse. To characterise the critical point we imagine
that a uniform load has been applied to the top of the granular medium and we
study the evolution with depth of fluctuations in the distribution of load.
Close to the critical point explicit calculation reveals that the evolution of
load exhibits scaling behaviour analogous to thermodynamic critical phenomena.
The critical behaviour is remarkably tractable: the harvest of analytic results
includes scaling functions that describe the evolution of the variance of the
load distribution close to the critical point and of the entire load
distribution right at the critical point, values of the associated critical
exponents, and determination of the upper critical dimension. These results are
of intrinsic interest as a tractable example of a random critical point. Of the
many applications of the q-model, the critical behaviour is particularly
relevant to network models of river basins, as we briefly discuss. Finally we
discuss circumstances under which quantum network models that describe the
surface electronic states of a quantum Hall multilayer can be mapped onto the
classical $q$-model. For mesoscopic multilayers of finite circumference the
mapping fails; instead a mapping to a ferromagnetic supersymmetric spin chain
has proved fruitful. We discuss aspects of the superspin mapping and give a new
elementary derivation of it making use of operator rather than functional
methods.

filtering applications. To be operational, these applications require high
filtering performances which are achieved by using rule-based filters. With
this technique, an administrator has to tune a set of rules for each topic.
However, filters become obsolescent over time. The decrease of their
performances is due to diachronic polysemy of terms that involves a loss of
precision and to diachronic polymorphism of concepts that involves a loss of
recall.
  To help the administrator to maintain his filters, we have developed a method
which automatically detects filtering obsolescence. It consists in making a
learning-based control filter using a set of documents which have already been
categorised as relevant or not relevant by the rule-based filter. The idea is
to supervise this filter by processing a differential comparison of its
outcomes with those of the control one.
  This method has many advantages. It is simple to implement since the training
set used by the learning is supplied by the rule-based filter. Thus, both the
making and the use of the control filter are fully automatic. With automatic
detection of obsolescence, learning-based filtering finds a rich application
which offers interesting prospects.

sub-string-scale length is a consequence of the confinement of quantized flux
associated with the scalar dualized ten-form background field strength *F_{10},
evidence for a -2brane in the BPS spectrum of M theory. Using heterotic-type I
duality, we infer the existence of an M2brane of finite width O(\sqrt{\alpha'})
in M-theory, the strong coupling resolution of a spacetime singularity in the
D=9 twisted and toroidally compactified E_8 x E_8 heterotic string. This
phenomenon has a bosonic string analog in the existence of a stable short
electric flux tube arising from the confinement of photons due to tachyon field
dynamics. The appendix clarifies the appearance of nonperturbative states and
enhanced gauge symmetry in toroidal compactifications of the type I' string. We
account for all of the known disconnected components of the moduli space of
theories with sixteen supercharges, in striking confirmation of heterotic-type

  pages",,,,"math.QA hep-th math.CV",,"  Within the framework of complex supergeometry and motivated by
two-dimensional genus-zero holomorphic N=1 superconformal field theory, we
define the moduli space of N=1 genus-zero super-Riemann surfaces with oriented
and ordered half-infinite tubes, modulo superconformal equivalence. We define a
sewing operation on this moduli space which gives rise to the sewing equation
and normalization and boundary conditions. To solve this equation, we develop a
formal theory of infinitesimal N=1 superconformal transformations based on a
representation of the N=1 Neveu-Schwarz algebra in terms of superderivations.
We solve a formal version of the sewing equation by proving an identity for
certain exponentials of superderivations involving infinitely many formal
variables. We use these formal results to give a reformulation of the moduli
space, a more detailed description of the sewing operation, and an explicit
formula for obtaining a canonical supersphere with tubes from the sewing
together of two canonical superspheres with tubes. We give some specific
examples of sewings, two of which give geometric analogues of associativity for
an N=1 Neveu-Schwarz vertex operator superalgebra. We study a certain linear
functional in the supermeromorphic tangent space at the identity of the moduli
space of superspheres with 1+1 tubes (one outgoing tube and one incoming tube)
which is associated to the N=1 Neveu-Schwarz element in an N=1 Neveu-Schwarz
vertex operator superalgebra. We prove the analyticity and convergence of the
infinite series arising from the sewing operation. Finally, we define a bracket
on the supermeromorphic tangent space at the identity of the moduli space of
superspheres with 1+1 tubes and show that this gives a representation of the
N=1 Neveu-Schwarz algebra with central charge zero.
