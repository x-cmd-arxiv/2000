  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Gamma-Ray Bursts are good candidates of the ``bottom up'' scenario for the
generation of the UHE Cosmic Rays. In the most discussed model of GRBs, namely
the ``fireball'' model, a highly relativistic shock forms and seems capable of
accelerating the cosmic rays up to the EeV range. However, only the first Fermi
cycle produces a large energy gain to particles coming from the external
medium. Thus, a complementary acceleration is proposed, downstream of the
external shock, in the relativistic plasma of the GRBs, where crossings of
relativistic fronts are likely to occur. Both forward and backward fronts are
necessary for the internal Fermi acceleration to work and the physical process
that generates them is presented. We found that there exists a relevant
physical process similar to Brillouin backscattering that redistributes the
incoming energy in the plasma shell. This redistribution occurs through the
generation of sound waves that heat the plasma shell and also through the
generation of both forward and backward relativistic Alfven fronts that
accelerate cosmic rays by the Fermi process. We show that this ensemble of
processes is able to account for the generation of UHE cosmic rays.
  There are two opportunities for these combined processes, first during the
``primary'' Gamma-Ray Burst where baryons are entrained by the relativistic
pair wind, second during the predeceleration and deceleration stages when the
fireball interacts with the interstellar medium. However, because of the
synchrotron losses, only the second stage can produce the UHE cosmic rays.

particles become frozen in time when they reach the 'singularity' (of dimension
alpha'). A particle which enters a black hole in real time exits from the Big
Bang or ""white hole"" in the time-inverted universe, leaving behind a trace of
annihilation radiation. A diagram of this phenomenon is constructed, consistent
with existing knowledge of the early universe. The primordeal black holes

characterized by the cut-off radius and the scale length, shows no
statistically significant changes. Thus, the ratio of radial to vertical scale
parameters, h/z0, is ~1.7 times smaller for the sample of interacting/merging
galaxies. The total lack of typical flat disk ratios (h/z0)>7 in the latter
sample implies that vertical disk heating is most efficient for (extremely)
thin disks. Statistically nearly all galactic disks in the sample (93%) possess
non-isothermal vertical luminosity profiles like the sech (60%) and exp (33%)

the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we derive the velocity of an
element of vortex line as a function of the local gradient of the trap
potential, the line curvature and the angular velocity of the trap rotation.
This velocity yields small-amplitude normal modes of the vortex for 2D and 3D
condensates. For an axisymmetric trap, the motion of the vortex line is a
superposition of plane-polarized standing-wave modes. In a 2D condensate, the
planar normal modes are degenerate, and their superposition can result in
helical traveling waves, which differs from a 3D condensate. Including the
effects of trap rotation allows us to find the angular velocity that makes the
vortex locally stable. For a cigar-shape condensate, the vortex curvature makes
a significant contribution to the frequency of the lowest unstable normal mode;
furthermore, additional modes with negative frequencies appear. As a result, it
is considerably more difficult to stabilize a central vortex in a cigar-shape
condensate than in a disc-shape one. Normal modes with imaginary frequencies
can occur for a nonaxisymmetric condensate (in both 2D and 3D). In connection
with recent JILA experiments, we consider the motion of a straight vortex line
in a slightly nonspherical condensate. The vortex line changes its orientation
in space at the rate proportional to the degree of trap anisotropy and can
exhibit periodic recurrences.

benefits that CHR, specifically their implementation in SICStus Prolog, have
provided to computational linguists working on grammar design tools. CHR rules
are applied by means of a subsumption check and this check is made only when

development, we consider the Attribute Logic Engine (ALE), a Prolog
preprocessor for logic programming with typed feature structures, and its
extension to a complete grammar development system for Head-driven Phrase
Structure Grammar (HPSG), a popular constraint-based linguistic theory that
uses typed feature structures. In this context, CHR can be used not only to
extend the constraint language of feature structure descriptions to include
relations in a declarative way, but also to provide support for constraints
with complex antecedents and constraints on the co-occurrence of feature values

nucleated in the bulk. This leads us to ask the question: Can the black hole -
brane-world system evolve towards a configuration of thermal equilibrium? To
answer this, we generalize the second Randall-Sundrum scenario to allow for
non-static bulk regions on each side of the brane-world. Explicitly, we take
the bulk to be a {\it Vaidya-AdS} metric, which describes the gravitational
collapse of a spherically symmetric null dust fluid in Anti-de Sitter
spacetime. Using the background subtraction technique to calculate the
Euclidean action, we argue that at late times a sufficiently large black hole
will relax to a point of thermal equilibrium with the brane-world environment.
These results have interesting implications for early-universe cosmology.

three-step mechanism as proceeding via above-threshold ionization (ATI)
followed by the electron propagation in the laser-dressed continuum and the
subsequent laser assisted recombination (LAR). An amplitude of harmonic
production is given by the coherent sum of contributions from different
intermediate ATI channels labeled by the number m of absorbed laser photons.
The range of m-values that gives substantial contribution is explored and found
to be rather broad for high harmonic generation. The coherence effects are of
crucial importance being responsible for the characteristic pattern of harmonic
intensities with a plateau domain followed by a cutoff region. Due to
multiphoton nature of the process, an efficient summation of m-contributions
can be carried out in the framework of the saddle point method. The saddle
points correspond to some complex-valued labels m=m_c associated with the
intermediate effective ATI channels in the three-step harmonic generation
process. The advantage of this approach stems from the fact that summation over
large number of conventional ATI m-channels is replaced by summation over small
number of effective m_c-channels. The equation governing m_c has a transparent
physical meaning: the electron ejected from the atom on the first (ATI) stage
should return to the core to make LAR possible. The calculated rates are in
good agreement with the results obtained by other approaches.
