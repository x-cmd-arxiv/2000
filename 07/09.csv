the particles and fields are not confined to their mass shells. We show that in
the mass-shell limit, the generalized Lorentz force obtained by means of the
retarded Green's functions for the five-dimensional field equations provides
the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac radiation reaction terms (with renormalized
mass and charge). We also obtain general coupled equations for the orbit and
the off-shell dynamical mass during the evolution. The theory does not admit
radiation if the particle remains identically on-shell. The structure of the
equations implies that the mass-shell deviaiton is bounded when the external
field is removed.
