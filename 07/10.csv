detected at the 2sigma level rises from 0.0 in the central regions (excluding
the cD galaxy) to 12.5+/-8% at R200. For 165 of the galaxies in our catalogue,
we compare the H-alpha equivalent widths with their [OII] equivalent widths,
from the CNOC1 spectra. The fraction of strong H-alpha emission line galaxies
is consistent with the fraction of strong [OII] emission galaxies in the CNOC1
sample: only 2+/-1% have no detectable [OII] emission and yet significant
(>2sigma) H-alpha equivalent widths. Dust obscuration, non-thermal ionization,
and aperture effects are all likely to contribute to this non-correspondence of
emission lines. We identify six spectroscopically 'secure' k+a galaxies
(W(OII)<5 A and W(Hdelta)>5 A); at least two of these show strong signs in
H-alpha of star formation in regions that are covered by the slit from which
the spectra were obtained. Thus, some fraction of galaxies classified k+a based
on spectra shortward of 6000 A are likely to be undergoing significant star
formation. These results are consistent with a 'strangulation' model for
cluster galaxy evolution, in which star formation in cluster galaxies is
gradually decreased, and is neither enhanced nor abruptly terminated by the
cluster environment.

stability of their accretion discs. We find that their discs are almost
certainly thermally stable as expected. This result confirms Osaki's suggestion
(1996) that permanent superhump systems form a new subclass of cataclysmic
variables (CVs), with relatively short orbital periods and high mass transfer
rates. We note that if the high accretion rates estimated in permanent
superhump systems represent their mean secular values, then their mass transfer
rates cannot be explained by gravitational radiation, therefore, either
magnetic braking should be extrapolated to systems below the period gap or they
must have mass transfer cycles. Alternatively, a new mechanism that removes
angular momentum from CVs below the gap should be invoked.
  We suggest applying the nova cycle scenarios offered for systems above the
period gap to the short orbital period CVs. Permanent superhumps have been
observed in the two non-magnetic ex-novae with binary periods below the gap.
Their post-nova magnitudes are brighter than their pre-outburst values. In one
case (V1974 Cyg) it has been demonstrated that the pre-nova should have been a
regular SU UMa system. Thus it is the first nova whose accretion disc was
observed to change its thermal stability. If the superhumps in this system
indicate persistent high mass transfer rates rather than a temporary change
induced by irradiation from the hot post-nova white dwarf, it is the first
direct evidence for mass transfer cycles in CVs. The proposed cycles are driven
by the nova eruption.

internal colour, which we take as evidence for recent episodes of
star-formation. In most cases these colour variations manifest themselves via
the presence of blue cores, an effect of opposite sign to that expected from
metallicity gradients. Examining similarly-selected ellipticals in five rich
clusters with 0.37<z<0.83 we find a significant lower dispersion in their
internal colours. This suggests that the colour inhomogeneities have a strong
environmental dependence being weakest in dense environments where spheroidal
formation was presumably accelerated at early times. We use the trends defined
by the cluster sample to define an empirical model based on a high-redshift of
formation and estimate that at z~1 about half the field spheroidals must be
undergoing recent episodes of star-formation. Using spectral synthesis models,
we construct the time dependence of the density of star-formation. Although the
samples are currently small, we find evidence for an increase in $\rho_{SFR}$
between z=0 to z=1. We discuss the implications of this rise in the context of
that observed in the similar rise in the abundance of galaxies with irregular
morphology. Regardless of whether there is a connection our results provide
strong evidence for the continued formation of field spheroidals over 0<z<1.

motion of the co-existing galaxies in the cluster triggers the formation of
unique features, which trace their position and motion. Galactic wakes, for
example, are an apparent result of the ICM/galaxy interactions, and they
constitute an important tool for deciphering the motion of the cluster
galaxies. In this paper we investigate whether Bondi-Hoyle accretion can create
galactic wakes by focusing the ICM behind moving galaxies. The solution of the
equations that describe this physical problem provide us with observable
quantities along the wake at any time of its lifetime. We also investigate
which are the best environmental conditions for the detectability of such
structures in the X-ray images of clusters of galaxies. We find that
significant Bondi-Hoyle wakes can only be formed in low temperature clusters,
and that they are more pronounced behind slow-moving, relatively massive
galaxies. The scale length of these elongated structures is not very large: in
the most favourable conditions a Bondi-Hoyle wake in a cluster at the redshift
of z=0.05 is 12 arcsec long. However, the wake's X-ray emission is noticeably
strong: the X-ray flux can reach ~30 times the flux of the surrounding medium.
Such features will be easily detectable in Chandra's and XMM-Newton's X-ray
images of nearby, relatively poor clusters of galaxies.

is found to coexist with low frequency spin fluctuations over a large region of

above a critical doping $x_c\sim 0.19$. This value of $x_c$ coincides with the
doping at which the normal state pseudogap extrapolates to zero. The superfluid

increases with $x$ and becomes nearly doping-independent for $x>x_c$. These

other and of the coordinates. It can be realized on a homogeneous but
anisotropic flat Euclidean space. The second model has couplings depending on
the extra transverse fifth direction. This model can be realized by a U(1)
gauge theory on the Randall-Sundrum background. We find that in both models a
new phase exists, the layer phase, in which a massless photon is localized on
the four-dimensional layers. We find that this phase is separated from the

between bundles with connections and their holonomies for connected manifolds.
The holonomy of a gerbe with group $S^1$ on a simply connected manifold $M$ is
a group morphism from the thin second homotopy group to $S^1$, satisfying a
smoothness condition, where a homotopy between maps from $[0,1]^2$ to $M$ is
thin when its derivative is of rank $\leq 2$. For the non-simply connected
case, holonomy is replaced by a parallel transport functor between two monoidal
Lie groupoids. The reconstruction of the gerbe and connection from its holonomy
is carried out in detail for the simply connected case. Our approach to abelian
gerbes with connections holds out prospects for generalizing to the non-abelian
case via the theory of double Lie groupoids.

of EPR type correlations provides the quantum protection. We identify universal
constraints on the level of shared information between the intended receiver
(Bob) and any eavesdropper (Eve) and use this to make a general evaluation of
security. We identify teleportation as an optimum eavesdropping technique.

as output all of the input light for a beam splitter that is 50% absorbing.
This effect is also responsible for nonlinear quantum interference when two
photons are incident on the beam splitter.
