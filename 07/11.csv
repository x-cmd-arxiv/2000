several orders of magnitude in scale. Aiming to understand the origin of this
structure, we carry out numerical simulations of molecular cloud fragmentation,
taking into account self-gravity, dissipation and energy input. Self-gravity is
computed through a tree code, with fully or quasi periodic boundary conditions.
Energy dissipation is introduced through cloud-cloud ineslatic collisions.
Several schemes are tested for the energy input. It appears that energy input
from galactic shear allows to achieve a stationary clumped state for the gas,
avoiding final collapse. When a stationary turbulent cascade is established, it
is possible to derive meaningful statistical studies on the data such as the
fractal dimension of the mass distribution.

  ``Galaxy Disks and Disk Galaxies''",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss a comparison of models for the formation of disk galaxies both in
a Universe dominated by cold dark matter (CDM) and one in which the force law
is given by modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Our main aim is to address the
claim made by McGaugh & de Blok that CDM suffers from severe fine-tuning
problems, which are circumvented under MOND. As we show, CDM indeed requires
some amount of tuning of the feedback efficiencies to obtain a Tully-Fisher
relation (TFR) as steep as observed. However, that same model is in excellent
agreement with a wide variety of additional observations. Therefore, the modest
amount of feedback needed should not be regarded a fine-tuning problem.
Instead, its requirement should be considered a generic prediction for CDM,
which might be tested with future observations and with detailed modeling of
feedback processes. We also show that galaxy formation in a MOND universe can
not simultaneously reproduce the TFR and the lack of high surface brightness
dwarf galaxies. We thus conclude that CDM is a more viable theory for the
formation of disk galaxies than MOND.

that a model with a mixed single/binary population is at least ~20 times more
likely to explain our data than a pure binary population. This result depends
on assumed period distributions for binary LMWDs, assumed companion masses and
several other factors. Therefore, the evidence in favour of the existence of a
population of single LMWDs is not sufficient, in our opinion, to firmly
establish the existence of such a population, but does suggest that extended

off-center starbursts close to the end of an elongated dwarf irregular

activity of a dI, or may be caused by a set of special properties of such
systems or their environment. For a first investigation of this issue, we
analyse the nearby iI,C BCDs Markarian 59 and Markarian 71. Using deep
ground-based spectrophotometric data and HST images, we derive physical
properties, structure and ages of the starburst regions and the underlying
stellar host galaxies. The metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity of
the star-forming regions and along the major axis of Mrk 59 which suggests
effective mixing of heavy elements on kpc scales. The surface brightness
profiles of the underlying host galaxies in either iI,C BCD show an exponential
decay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediate
between typical iE/nE BCDs and dIs. Spectral population synthesis models in
combination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield most
likely formation ages of ~2 Gyr for the host galaxies in both iI,C BCDs, with
upper limits of ~4 Gyr for Mrk 59 and ~3 Gyr for Mrk 71, i.e. significantly
lower than the typical age of several Gyr derived for the host galaxies of
iE/nE BCDs. These findings raise the question whether iI,C systems form a
distinct class within BCDs with respect to the age and structure of their
hosts, or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 BCDs
and ""classical"" iE/nE BCDs. Properties of analogous objects studied in the
local universe and at medium redshifts provide some support for this
evolutionary hypothesis.

treated time-dependently, and the efficiency declines exponentially with the
geometric distance from the convective boundary. It has been considered at all
convective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell
region which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the
chemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results
include a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon
stars of low mass and luminosity. A C13 pocket which may serve as a neutron
source for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into
the C12 rich intershell. Overshoot applied to the pulse-driven convective zone
during the He-flash leads to a deeper penetration of the bottom of this
convective zone into the C/O core below the He-burning shell. This in turn
causes He4 to be less abundant in the intershell while C12 and O16 are more
abundant compared to calculations without overshoot. We show that overshoot at

enhance the efficiency of the third dredge-up. Characteristic properties of the

of sight. In this paper we address the study of double lenses and obtain five
main results. (i) First we generalize the procedure to extract the available
information, contained in the observed shear field, from the case of a single
lens to that of a double lens. (ii) Then we evaluate the possibility of
detecting the signature of double lensing given the known properties of the
distribution of clusters of galaxies. (iii) As a different astrophysical
application, we demonstrate how the method can be used to detect the presence
of a dark cluster that might happen to be partially aligned with a bright
cluster studied in terms of statistical lensing. (iv) In addition, we show that
the redshift distribution of the source galaxies, which in principle might also
contribute to break the curl-free character of the shear field, actually
produces systematic effects typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the
double lensing effects we are focusing on. (v) Remarkably, a discussion of
relevant contributions to the noise of the shear measurement has brought up an
intrinsic limitation of weak lensing analyses, since one specific contribution,
associated with the presence of a non-vanishing two-galaxy correlation
function, turns out not to decrease with the density of source galaxies (and
thus with the depth of the observations).

number $Z$ and rewired bonds, resembling the small-world network proposed
recently but with site-energy disorder and quantum links instead of classical
ones. The random rewiring of bonds in the chain with large $Z$ enhances both
the topological disorder and the effective dimensionality. From the competition
between disorder and dimensionality enhancement a transition from localization
to delocalization is found by using the level statistics method combined with
the finite-size scaling analysis. The critical value of the rewiring rate for
this transition is determined numerically. We obtain a universal critical
integrated distribution of level spacing $s$ in the form $I_{p_{c}}(s)\propto
\exp (-A_{c}s^{\alpha})$, with $A_{c}\simeq 1.50$ and $\alpha \simeq 1.0$. This
reveals the possible existence of metal-insulator transition in materials with

We apply the general formalism to the one-band Hubbard model off $n=1$, with
inclusion of site-diagonal randomness to simulate effects of doping. The
interplay between the coherence induced plasmon feature and the
incoherence-induced high energy continuum is explained in terms of the
evolution in the local spectral density upon hole doping. Inclusion of static
disorder is shown to result in qualitative changes in the low-energy features,
in particular, to the overdamping of the plasmon feature, resulting in a
completely incoherent response. The calculated EELS lineshapes are compared to
experimentally observed EELS spectra for the normal state of the high-$T_{c}$

frequencies of a list of selected terms. This list depends on the topic to be

characteristic words used in the relevant documents of the corpus; the second
one chooses, among the previous list, the most discriminant ones. The length of
the vector is optimized automatically for each topic. At the end of the term
selection, a vector of typically 25 words is defined for the topic, so that
each document which has to be processed is represented by a vector of term
frequencies.

quasi-periodic peaks, which originate from the wave packet bouncing back and

to a power-law. In the Buchdahl limit 2M/R -> 8/9 the light travel time between

that the first peak arrives only at infinitely late time. The modes of neutron

apply to spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition and the null generic

such that for any $p,q \not\in K'$, if there exists a ``fastest null
geodesic'', $\gamma$, between $p$ and $q$, then $\gamma$ cannot enter $K$. As
an application of this theorem, we show that if, in addition, the spacetime is
globally hyperbolic with a compact Cauchy surface, then any observer at
sufficiently late times cannot have a particle horizon. The second theorem
states that if a timelike conformal boundary can be attached to the spacetime
such that the spacetime with boundary satisfies strong causality as well as a
compactness condition, then any ``fastest null geodesic'' connecting two points
on the boundary must lie entirely within the boundary. It follows from this
theorem that generic perturbations of anti-de Sitter spacetime always produce a
time delay relative to anti-de Sitter spacetime itself.

of a system of closed n-branes and dual (D-n-4)-branes in D dimensions,
interacting with a dynamical (n+1)-form gauge potential. The framework proves
sufficiently general to include also a coupling of the branes to (the bosonic
sector of) a dynamical supergravity theory. We provide a manifestly
Lorentz-invariant and S-duality symmetric Lagrangian, involving the (n+1)-form
gauge potential and its dual (D-n-3)-form gauge potential in a symmetric way.
The corresponding action depends on generalized Dirac-strings. The requirement
of string-independence of the action leads to Dirac-Schwinger quantization
conditions for the charges of branes and dual branes, but produces also
additional constraints on the possible interactions. It turns out that a system
of interacting dyonic branes admits two quantum mechanically inequivalent
formulations, involving inequivalent quantization conditions. Asymmetric
formulations involving only a single vector potential are also given. For the
special cases of dyonic branes in even dimensions known results are easily
recovered. As a relevant application of the method we write an effective action
which implements the inflow anomaly cancellation mechanism for interacting
heterotic strings and five-branes in D=10. A consistent realization of this
mechanism requires, in fact, dynamical p-form potentials and a systematic
introduction of Dirac-strings.

input-output nonlinear discrete-time system approximated by two neural
networks. The approach allows a simple linear pole-placement controller (which
is itself not a neural network) to be designed. The control law is specified
such that the controller adaptively calculates an appropriate feedback
linearizing control law at each sampling instant by utilizing plant parameter
estimates provided by the neural system model. The control system also adapts
itself on-line. This avoids the requirement for exact knowledge of the power
system dynamics and full state measurement as well as other difficulties
associated with implementing analytical input-output feedback linearizing
control for a complex power system model. Furthermore, a departure is made from
the `ad hoc' manner in which many neural controllers have been designed for
power systems; the approach used here has foundations in control theoretic
concepts of adaptive feedback linearization and pole-placement control design.
  Simulation results demonstrate the performance of this controller for a
representative example of a single-machine/infinite bus power system

$\chi$ on $M$ one associates the Koszul complex $K(\chi)$. If $M$ is a free

is grade sensitive with respect to $\Im\chi$.
  In this note we investigate the case of a module $M$ of projective dimension
1 (more precisely, $M$ has a free resolution of length 1) for which the first
non-vanishing Fitting ideal $\I_M$ has the maximally possible grade $r+1$,
$r=\rank M$. Then $h=\grade \Im\chi\le r+1$ for all linear forms $\chi$ on $M$,
and it turns out that $H_{r-i}(K(\chi))=0$ for all even $i<h$ and
$H_{r-i}(K(\chi))\iso \SS^{(i-1)/2}(C)$ for all odd $i<h$ where $\SS$ denotes
symmetric power and $C=\Ext_R^1(M,R)$, in other words, $C=\Cok\psi^*$ for a

r$, then $H_{r-h}(K(\chi))$ is neither 0 nor isomorphic to a symmetric power of
$C$, so that it is justified to say that $K(\chi)$ is grade sensitive for the
modules $M$ under consideration.
  We furthermore show that the maximally possible value $\grade \Im\chi=r+1$
can only occur in two extreme cases: (i) $r=1$ or (ii) $\rank F=1$ and $r$ is
odd.

adding its conjugate variable $\tau$.
  In this paper we look at a time aperiodic perturbation $H^{1}(p,q,t)$ which
tends as $t\to \infty$ to either a time independent perturbation or a time
quasiperiodic perturbation and we prove a KAM-type theorem. Extending the phase
space results in the preservation under a small enough perturbation of
cylinders of the extended autonomous system rather than the usual tori. To
prove the theorem we transform the Hamiltonian $H$ to a normal form which
depends on fewer angles, none if possible. This transformation is done via a
near identity canonical transformation. The canonical transformation is
constructed using the Lie series formalism and by solving for a generating
function. Because of the aperiodic time dependence, the usual Fourier series
methods used to obtain the generating function no longer apply. Instead, we use
Fourier transform methods to solve for the generating function and make use of
an isoenergetic non-degeneracy condition which results in a shift of
frequencies associated with each cylinder.

1/f^alpha seems to be transformed again into a power law spectrum 1/f^beta

transformed spectrum is shown to be characterized by a certain corner frequency
f_c which divides the spectrum into two parts with different exponents. We
derive f_c depending on a as f_c sim a^(-2/(alpha-1)). It turns out that the

these putative extra dimensions is too high, then the neutrino pulse from the
supernova will differ from that actually seen. The dominant mechanism for the
production of Kaluza-Klein gravitons and dilatons in the supernova is via
gravistrahlung and dilastrahlung from the nucleon-nucleon system. In this paper
we compute the rates for these processes in a model-independent way using
low-energy theorems which relate the emissivities to the measured
nucleon-nucleon cross section. This is possible because for soft gravitons and
dilatons the leading contribution to the energy-loss rate is from graphs in
which the gravitational radiation is produced from external nucleon legs.
Previous calculations neglected these mechanisms. We re-evaluate the bounds on
toroidally-compactified ""gravity-only"" dimensions (GODs), and find that
consistency with the observed SN1987a neutrino signal requires that if there
are two such dimensions then their radius must be less than 1 micron.

distinct representations that differ by their parity or/and charge conjugation

distinguishable. For example, resonances from the full listing reported by the
Particle Data Group are accommodated by Rarita-Schwinger (RS) type
representations (k/2,k/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] with k=1,3, and 5, the highest spin
states being J=3/2^-, 7/2^+, and 11/2^+, respectively. In contrast to this,
most of the ``missing'' resonances fall into the opposite parity RS fields of
highest-spins 5/2^-, 5/2^+, and 9/2^+, respectively. Rarita-Schwinger fields
with physical resonances as lower-spin components can be treated as a whole
without imposing auxiliary conditions on them. Such fields do not suffer the
Velo-Zwanziger problem but propagate causally in the presence of
electromagnetic fields. The pathologies associated with RS fields arise
basically because of the attempt to use them to describe isolated spin-J=k+1/ 2
states, rather than multispin-parity clusters. The positions of the observed RS
clusters and their spacing are well explained trough the interplay between the

compute cross sections and structure functions, and investigate the kinematic
conditions for which the observables are determined either by $\alpha$-knockout
or by halo neutron-knockout. The optimal kinematical domain to disantangle the
momentum distributions of the various components of the three--body system ($q

scattering. The model includes the complete set of standard quark model forces,
including OGE spin-orbit and tensor and scalar confinement spin-orbit.
Scattering amplitudes derived assuming SHO and Coulomb plus linear plus
hyperfine meson wavefunctions are compared. In I=2 pi pi we find approximate
agreement with the S-wave phase shift from threshold to 1.5 GeV, where we
predict an extremum that is supported by the data. Near threshold we find rapid
energy dependence that may reconcile theoretical estimates of small scattering
lengths with experimental indications of larger ones based on extrapolation of
measurements at moderate kpi^2. In PsV scattering we find that the quark-quark
L*S and T forces map into L*S and T meson-meson interactions, and the P-wave
L*S force is large. Finally we consider scattering in J^PC-exotic channels, and
note that some of the Deck effect mechanisms suggested as possible nonresonant
origins of the pi_1(1400) signal are not viable in this model.

  of Spatial and Temporal Distances. I. the Theory","RevTex,21 pages,4 figures,IARD 2000",,,,"physics.class-ph",,"  It is shown in this paper that the difference between the two forms of
relativity - the ''true transformation (TT) relativity'' and - the ''apparent
transformation (AT) relativity'' is essentially caused by the difference in the
concept of \emph{sameness} of a physical system, i.e., of a physical quantity,
for different, relatively moving, observers. In the ''TT relativity'' the same
quantity for different inertial frames of reference is covariantly defined
four-dimensional (4D) tensor quantity, which transforms according to the
Lorentz transformation as the TT. In the ''AT relativity'' parts of a 4D tensor
quantity are often considered as the same quantity for different observers,
although they correspond to different quantities in 4D spacetime, and they are
not connected by the Lorentz transformation than by the AT. Then the true
transformations of a spacetime length and the apparent transformations of a
spatial distance (the Lorentz contraction) and of a temporal distance (the
usual dilatation of time) are examined in detail. It is proved that only the
true transformations of the spacetime length are in agreement with the special
relativity as the theory of a 4D spacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry.

Michelson-Morley type experiments, the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments and
the Ives-Stilwell type experiments are analyzed using the nonrelativistic
theory, the ''apparent transformations (AT) relativity'' and the ''true

they are complete from the ''TT relativity'' viewpoint) are in agreement with
the ''TT relativity'' in which the special relativity is understood as the
theory of a four-dimensional spacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry. It
is also explicitly shown that, in contrast to the usual opinion, the commonly
used ''AT relativity'' does not always agree with experiments. The concept of
sameness of a physical quantity is essential for the distinction between the
two forms of relativity both in the theory and in experiments. The difference
in this concept causes the agreement of the ''TT relativity'' with the
experiments and the disagreement of the ''AT relativity.''

aether. The existence of special elementary excitations of the aether medium --
inertons -- around the particle has been the main peculiarity of that
mechanism. The present paper treats the impact of inertons on the collective
behaviour of atoms in a solid. It is shown that inertons should contribute to
the effective potential of interaction of atoms in the crystal lattice. The
possibility of separating this inerton contribution from the value of the atom
vibration amplitude is analysed. The experiment which assumes the presence of
the hypothetical inerton field is performed. The expected changes in the
structure of the test specimens caused by this field are in fact convincingly
fixed in micrographs.
