virial radius and into the infall region. Using 1057 redshifts, we use the
infall pattern in redshift space to determine the mass profile of A576 to a
radius of ~4 Mpc/h. This mass estimation technique makes no assumptions about
the equilibrium state of the cluster. Within 1 Mpc/h, the mass profile we
derive exceeds that determined from X-ray observations by a factor of 2.5. At
\~2.5 Mpc/h, however, the mass profile agrees with virial mass estimates. Our
mass profile is consistent with a NFW or Hernquist profile, but it is
inconsistent with an isothermal sphere. R-band images of a $3^\circ x 3^\circ$
region centered on the cluster allow an independent determination of the
cluster light profile. We calculate the integrated mass-to-light ratio as a
function of cluster radius; it decreases smoothly from the core to ~4 Mpc/h.
The differential dM/dL_R profile decreases more steeply; we find M/L_R ~100 h
at ~4 Mpc/h, in good agreement with the mass-to-light ratios of individual
galaxies. This value implies $\Omega_m \lesssim 0.4$ at 95% confidence. For a
Hernquist model, the best-fit mass profiles differ from the observed surface
number density of galaxies; the galaxies have a larger scale radius than the
mass. This result is consistent with the centrally peaked $M/L_R$ profile.
Similarly, the scale radius of the light profile is larger than that of the
mass profile. We discuss some potential systematic effects; none can easily
reconcile our results with a constant mass-to-light ratio. (abstract edited)

  In this paper the final collapse stages of the different scenarios are
compared by N-body simulations for shells and spheres. It is shown that
fragmentation is much more pronounced for shells. Taking a galactic tidal field
into account shells preferably form twin (or multiple) systems, whereas spheres
end up as single clusters. The twins are characterized by identical

z Oph is the earliest member of the Sco OB2 association and is a runaway star
rapidly moving with an HII region, S27. We detected 2 major filamentary cloud
complexes; one including L156 (L156 complex) is lying across nearly the center
of S27, and the other one (L204 complex) is located near the eastern edge of
S27. Total masses of them traced by the 12CO are 520 Mo and 1110 Mo,
respectively. Denser cloud cores detected in C18O are locally distributed on
the near side of the L204 complex to z Oph, and lower density gas traced by
12CO spreads toward the opposite side. Both complexes have radial velocity
shifts that are correlated with the gas density. These spatial and velocity
structures can be interpreted as follows; (1) the L156 complex is stuck on the
expanding Stromgrem sphere and has been accelerated, (2) the gas in L204
complex was compressed and has also been accelerated outward by z Oph,
resulting the radial velocity shifts of diffuse low-density gas relative to the
dense cores embedded in the clouds. These density and velocity structures
indicate dynamical interaction between the HII region and the molecular clouds.
The cloud complexes are divided into 7 clouds by intensity distributions. In
order to investigate the acceleration mechanism, we calculated momentum and
kinetic energy for each cloud. They range from 60 to 800 Mo km/s and from 0.9
to 21 times 10^45 erg, respectively. We examined the effects of the stellar
wind and photo evaporation by UV field of z Oph and found that the stellar wind
can hardly input the momentum during the crossing time of the movement of z
Oph. UV radiation seems to be a more likely origin of the streaming gas motion.

14, 1997 from a particularly favorable viewing geometry above the comet's
orbital plane and at a distance of 0.25 AU. A structured coma was observed,
along with a long, straight dust trail. For the first time, we are able to
observe the path of particles as they evolve from the nucleus to the trail. The
particles that produce the infrared coma are large, with a radiation to
gravitational force ratio beta<0.001 (corresponding to >mm-sized particles).
The dust trail follows the orbit of the comet across our image, with a central
core that is 20,000 km wide, composed of particles with beta<1e-5 (size $\sim
5$ cm) from previous apparitions. The abundant large particles near the comet
pose a significant hazard to spacecraft. There is no evidence of a classical
cometary dust tail due to small particles with beta>0.001, in marked contrast
to other comets like P/Halley or C/Hale-Bopp. The structure of the coma
requires anisotropic emission and that the spin axis of the nucleus to be
nearly parallel to the orbital plane, resulting in strong seasonal variations
of the particle emission. While most of the infrared coma emission is due to
dust produced during the 1997 apparition, the core of the dust trail requires
emissions from previous apparitions. The total mass lost during the 1997
apparition is estimated to be
  2-6e13 g. Comparing to the gas mass loss from ultraviolet observations, the
dust-to-gas mass ratio is 10-30, much higher than has ever been suggested from
visual light observations. Using the recently-measured nuclear diameter, we
find that Encke can only last 3000-10,000 rhoN yr (where rhoN is the nuclear
density in g/cc) at its present mass loss rate.

Combining these data with existing [CII] observations provides a complete
picture of the predominant forms of carbon in the gas phase of the ISM. The new
CO (2-1) data show that the complex is immersed in an envelope of extended, low
level emission, undetected by previous (1-0) mapping efforts. The CO
(2-1)/(1-0) ratio in this envelope is >~3, a value consistent with optically
thin CO emission. The envelope is also relatively bright in [CI] and [CII], and
calculations show that it is mostly photodissociated: it appears to be
translucent (Av<1). Neutral carbon emission in the complex unexpectedly peaks
at the quiescent southern cloud (N159S). In the northern portion of the map
(the N160 nebula), the HII regions prominent in [CII] correspond to holes in
the [CI] distribution. Overall we find that, while the [CII]/CO ratio is
enhanced with respect to similar complexes in the Milky Way, the [CI]/CO ratio

star forming complexes of various ionized gas morphologies (compact knots,
complete or fragmentary shells) and sizes (10-200 pc). Our results are
consistent with a uniform set of evolutionary trends: The youngest, smaller,
filled regions that presumably are those just emerging from dense star forming
clouds, tend to be of high excitation and are highly obscured. Evolved, larger
shell-like regions have lower excitation and are less extincted due of the
action of stellar winds and supernovae. In at least one case we find evidence
for induced star formation which has led to a two-stage starburst. Age
estimates based on W(H alpha) measurements do not agree with those inferred
from wind-driven shell models of expanding H II regions. The most likely
explanation for this effect is the existence of a 2 Myr delay in the formation
of superbubbles caused by the pressure exerted by the high density medium in
which massive stars are born. We report the detection of a supernova remnant

stark contrast to steady-state standard disks, such disks in quiescence (being
non-steady) produce most of the X-ray emission very far from the last stable

We report a dramatic change in the degree of obscuration of the central source

absorption by either a stationary-state cloud of cold gas crossing the line of
sight, or a varying-state, initially neutral and dense amount of expanding gas
with decreasing density and therefore decreasing opacity. We also report the
detection of a second highly ionized absorber/emitter, which causes deep
FeXVII-XXII K edges at about 7.8 keV to appear in both BeppoSAX spectra of NGC

blend of Fe L recombination lines detected during the epoch of heavy nuclear
obscuration.

compatible with current massive star yields, which probably overestimate the

The sample is also unbiased against objects with luminous host galaxies since
the spectroscopy preferentially targeted extended objects. Simple color-color

the most unusual objects would be missing from such a color-selected sample. In
the subsample with broad emission lines, the average equivalent widths for MgII

However, the average equivalent widths for CIV and Ly-alpha are smaller than
predicted by previous studies of the Baldwin effect at lower redshift. This may
imply that the slopes of the CIV and Ly-alpha Baldwin effects evolve with
redshift, steepening with cosmic time. The broad emission line AGN also show a
higher incidence of associated MgII and CIV absorption than in most previous
surveys. This may arise from strong absorption being anti-correlated with
optical luminosity or becoming less frequent with cosmic time, or possibly
because our selection method is not biased against objects with resolved
spatial structure or reddened by dust associated with the absorbing gas.

disordered, as well as more conventional antiferromagnetic phases where $\psi$
is ordered in various possible patterns ($\theta$ is the angle of orientation
of the spin). To investigate when these phases exist in a physical system, we
study superconducting kagome wire networks in a transverse magnetic field when
the magnetic flux through an elementary triangle is a half of a flux quantum.
Within Ginzburg-Landau theory, we calculate the helicity moduli of each phase
to estimate the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition temperatures. Then at the
KT temperatures, we estimate the barriers to move vortices and effects that
lift the large degeneracy in the possible $\psi$ patterns. The effects we have
considered are inductive couplings, non-zero wire width, and the
order-by-disorder effect due to thermal fluctuations. The first two effects
prefer $q=0$ patterns while the last one selects a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$
pattern of supercurrents. Using the parameters of recent experiments, we
conclude that at the KT temperature, the non-zero wire width effect dominates,
which stabilizes a conventional superconducting phase with a $q=0$ current
pattern. However, by adjusting the experimental parameters, for example by
bending the wires a little, it appears that the novel $\psi^3$ superconducting
phase can instead be stabilized. The barriers to vortex motion are low enough
that the system can equilibrate into this phase.

computational techniques applied to ladders with several number of legs. This
tendency is studied also with the help of analytic spin-polaron approaches
directly in two dimensions. Our main result is that the presence of robust
antiferromagnetic correlations between spins located at both sides of a hole
either along the x or y axis, observed before numerically on square clusters,
is also found using ladders, as well as applying techniques based on a
string-basis expansion. This so-called ""across-the-hole"" nontrivial structure
exists even in the two-leg spin-gapped ladder system, and leads to an effective
reduction in dimensionality and spin-charge separation at short-distances, with
a concomitant drastic reduction in the quasiparticle (QP) weight Z. In general,
it appears that holes tend to induce one-dimensional-like spin arrangements to
improve their mobility. Using ladders it is also shown that the very small
J/t$\sim$0.1 regime of the standard t-J model may be more realistic than
anticipated in previous investigations, since such regime shares several
properties with those found in the extended model at realistic couplings.

that with increasing coupling strength to the channels the resonance widths of

microwave Sinai cavity with an attached waveguide with variable slit width was

in the tail of the distribution shows that the bosonic degrees of freedom
collapse to a one-dimensional tube with small transverse fluctuations. Assuming
that the vertex positions can fluctuate independently within the tube, we give
a theoretical argument which essentially explains the behaviour of p(R) in the
different cases, in particular predicting p(R) ~ R^{-3} in the supersymmetric

large-scale anisotropy on the inertial-range statistics of the passive scalar
quantity $\theta(t,{\bf x})$, advected by the synthetic turbulent velocity
field with the covariance $\propto\delta(t-t')|{\bf x}-{\bf x'}|^{\eps}$.
Inertial-range anomalous scaling behavior is established, and explicit
asymptotic expressions for the structure functions $ S_n (\r) \equiv <
[\theta(t,{\bf x}+\r)-\theta(t,{\bf x})]^{n}>$ are obtained; they are
represented by superpositions of power laws with universal (independent of the
anisotropy parameters) anomalous exponents, calculated to the first order in
$\eps$ in any space dimension. The exponents are associated with tensor
composite operators built of the scalar gradients, and exhibit a kind of
hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy: the less is the rank, the less
is the dimension and, consequently, the more important is the contribution to
the inertial-range behavior. The leading terms of the even (odd) structure
functions are given by the scalar (vector) operators. The small-scale
anisotropy reveals itself in odd correlation functions: for the incompressible
velocity field, $S_{3}/S_{2}^{3/2}$ decreases going down towards to the depth
of the inertial range, while the higher-order odd ratios increase; if the
compressibility is strong enough, the skewness factor also becomes increasing.
