No changes in the content","A&A (2000), 361, 429",,,"astro-ph",,"  We have analyzed the properties of a sample of 33 groups and clusters of
galaxies and examine the baryon content to check for trends over a decade in
temperature down to 1 keV. We examine the relative contribution of galaxies and
ICM to baryons in clusters through the gas-to-stellar mass ratio and find that
the typical stellar contribution to the baryonic mass is between 5 and 20%.
This ratio is found to be roughly independent of temperature. Therefore, we do
not confirm the trend of increasing gas-to-stellar mass ratio with increasing
temperature as previously claimed. We also determine distribution of the baryon
fraction with the density contrast. Virial masses are estimated from two
different mass estimators: one based on the isothermal hydrostatic equation
(IHE), the other based on scaling law models (SLM). Comparing the two methods,
we find that SLM lead to less dispersed baryon fractions over all density
contrasts and that the derived mean absolute valuesare significantly lower than
IHE mean values. We show that this is not due to the uncertainties on the outer
slope $\beta$ of the gas density profile but is rather indicating that IHE
masses are less reliable. Examining the shape of the baryon fraction profiles
we find that cluster baryon fractions estimated from SLM follow a scaling law.
Moreover, we do not find any strong evidence of increasing baryon (gas)
fraction with temperature, neither do we find the slope $\beta$ to increase
with temperature. The absence of clear trends between $f_{b}$ and
$M_{gas}/M_{*}$ with temperature is consistent with the similarity of baryon
fraction profiles and suggests that non-gravitational processes such as galaxy
feedback, do not play a dominant r\^ole in heating the intra-cluster gas on the
virial scale.

elliptical galaxies and in Galactic giant molecular clouds; they suggest that
the CO in this cloud is probably subthermally excited. Atomic gas, molecular
gas, and dust are very closely associated on scales of 100 pc; the atomic gas
can be understood as photodissociated envelopes around the molecular clouds.
The atomic column densities in this galaxy are quite low (10^20 cm^-2) because
the interstellar UV field is relatively low. The total gas-to-dust column
density ratios are consistent with Galactic gas-to-dust ratios. In short, the
molecular gas in NGC 205 seems to have very similar properties to the familiar

absorption for those lines of sight. Most of our models use a Boltzmann
particle code for the neutrals, allowing us to estimate neutral velocity
distributions throughout the heliosphere, from which we compute model
Lyman-alpha absorption profiles. In comparing these models with the data, we
find they predict too much absorption in sidewind and downwind directions,

Models created assuming different values of the interstellar temperature and

solar mass helium core to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive an
explosion in the 300 solar mass star and it collapses to a black hole. For this
star, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficient
to delay black hole formation and the star initially forms a 50 solar mass,
1000km core within which neutrinos are trapped. Although the star does not
become dynamically unstable, the calculated growth time of secular rotational
instabilities is shorter than the black hole formation time, and such
instabilities may develop. We estimate the energy and amplitude of the
gravitational waves emitted during this collapse. After the black hole forms,
accretion continues through a disk. Although the disk is far too large and cool
to transport energy efficiently to the rotational axis by neutrino
annihilation, it has ample potential energy to produce a 1e54erg jet driven by
magnetic fields. The interaction of this jet with surrounding circumstellar gas
may produce an energetic gamma-ray transient, but given the redshift and time
scale, this is probably not a model for typical gamma-ray bursts.

by this, I construct here idealized spectral models of an Advection-Dominated
Accretion Flow (ADAF) around a WD, for application to quiescent Dwarf Novae

ranging from a few keV to a few tens of keV, can account for the X-ray emission
properties of quiescent DN. If the energy advected by the flow is thermalized
in the WD atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface

substantially. This extreme-UV component provides a flux in the 0.055-0.28 keV

binding energies of these states rather than the original correlations of the

of the condensate two-time correlator is formulated in terms of the {\it
Orthogonality Catastrophe} (OC) for the exact N-body eigenstates, so that no
irreversible decay occurs without the OC. If an infinite external bath contacts
a finite condensate, the OC should practically always occur as long as the bath
degrees o freedom are interacting with each other. We claim that, if no
external bath is present and the role of the bath is played by the normal
component, no irreversible decay occurs. We discuss the role of the effect of
the {\it level repulsion} in eliminating the OC. At finite temperatures, the
time-correlations of the condensate isolated from the environment are dominated
by the reversible dephasing which results from the thermal ensemble averaging
over realizations of the normal component. Accordingly, the correlator exhibits
the gaussian decay with certain decay time $\tau_d$ dependent on temperature as
well as on intensity of the shot noise determined by the statistical
uncertainty in the number of bosons $N$ deposited into the trap. We estimate
$\tau_d$ for the conditions resembling those realized in the JILA experiment,

temperatures as large as 0.5 of the temperature of the Bose-Einstein
condensation, $\tau_d \leq 100$ms. Depending on the variance $\Delta N$ of $N$,
inclusion of the shot noise may shorten these times.

further revealed that while long-range charge order is present, long-range
orbital order is never established. Above the charge/orbital ordering
temperature T$_o$, the charge order fluctuations are more highly correlated

order in these samples. In addition, a longitudinal modulation of the lattice

forms the base for the application services. However, once the data model has
been fixed it is difficult to consider changing needs. This might be a problem
in specific domains, which are as dynamic as the healthcare domain. With fuzzy
data we address all those data that are difficult to organize in a single
database. In this paper we discuss a gradual and pragmatic approach that uses
the XML technology to conquer more model flexibility. XML may provide the clue
between unstructured text data and structured database solutions and shift the
paradigm from ""organizing the data along a given model"" towards ""organizing the
data along user requirements"".

  Unfoldings between Polygons and Polytopes","54 pages, 33 figures",,,"Smith Technical Report 069","cs.CG cs.DM",,"  We investigate how to make the surface of a convex polyhedron (a polytope) by
folding up a polygon and gluing its perimeter shut, and the reverse process of
cutting open a polytope and unfolding it to a polygon. We explore basic
enumeration questions in both directions: Given a polygon, how many foldings
are there? Given a polytope, how many unfoldings are there to simple polygons?
Throughout we give special attention to convex polygons, and to regular
polygons. We show that every convex polygon folds to an infinite number of
distinct polytopes, but that their number of combinatorially distinct gluings
is polynomial. There are, however, simple polygons with an exponential number
of distinct gluings.
  In the reverse direction, we show that there are polytopes with an
exponential number of distinct cuttings that lead to simple unfoldings. We
establish necessary conditions for a polytope to have convex unfoldings,
implying, for example, that among the Platonic solids, only the tetrahedron has
a convex unfolding. We provide an inventory of the polytopes that may unfold to
regular polygons, showing that, for n>6, there is essentially only one class of
such polytopes.

  Conceptual Approach","Contribution to icmp2000, July 17-22, 2000, Imperial College London
  (GRL 2.11)",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Referring to a conception put forward by Stuart Kauffman in his
""Investigations"", it is shown how the onset of classicity can be visualized in
terms of an emergent process originating in entangled ensemble states of
knotted spin networks. The latter exhibit a suitable autocatalytic behaviour
effectively producing knots by knots acting upon other knots. In particular, a
quantum computational structure can be described underlying spin networks such
that most conditions for a partial ordering are not more valid for the latter.
A concep- tual argument is given then indicating that on a fundamental level,
physics is non-local and a-temporal, and hence does not admit of the concept of
causality. Hence, modelling the emergence of classicity in terms of a
percolating web of coherence eventually decohering (in using a cellular
automata architecture) does not imply the necessity of visualizing histories of
directed percolation as causal sets. These aspects are compatible though with
the recent concept of spin foams which do not actually imply distinguished
directions of time flow on the micro-level.

excellent approximation to rotational symmetry and they are promising for a
good scaling, since they arise from the perfect action framework. Their

relatively compact expression for the gluon number density provided that the

annihilation on light nuclei reveal apparent suppression of annihilation upon
increasing the atomic charge $Z$ and mass number $A$. Using $\bar p$-nucleus
optical potentials $V_{{\rm opt}}$, fitted to $\bar p$-atom energy-shifts and
-widths, we resolve this suppression as due to the strong effective repulsion
produced by the very absorptive $V_{{\rm opt}}$. The low-energy $\bar
p$-nucleus wavefunction is kept substantially outside the nuclear surface and
the resulting reaction cross section saturates as function of the strength of
Im $V_{{\rm opt}}$. This feature, for $E >0$, parallels the recent prediction,
for $E < 0$, that the level widths of $\bar p$ atoms saturate and, hence, that
$\bar p$ deeply bound atomic states are relatively narrow. Antiproton
annihilation cross sections are calculated at $p_{L}=57$ MeV/c across the
periodic table, and their dependence on $Z$ and $A$ is classified and discussed
with respect to the Coulomb focussing effect at very low energies.

published based on the SN1987A observations.
  Here, we use a nonkinematic (thermal) time extent to provide a rest mass
estimate of a few eV (as mc^2 mass), if not zero. In the solution, we find that
a typical upper bound formula for the mass implies that this thermal extent was
attributable to about 10% of the particle energy measured on Earth. The present
approach yields an expected value for the mass, given any theoretical or model
dependent estimate of the fraction of the detected neutrino energy attributable
to the supernova temperature.

analysis used novel technology of a global detection of ionospheric effects
from solar flares (GLOBDET) as developed by one of the authors (Afraimovich E.
L.). The essence of the method is that use is made of appropriate filtering and
a coherent processing of variations in total electron content (TEC) in the
ionosphere which is determined from GPS data, simultaneously for the entire set
of visible (over a given time interval) GPS satellites at all stations used in
the analysis. It was found that fluctuations of TEC, obtained by removing the
linear trend of TEC with a time window of about 5 min, are coherent for all
stations and beams to the GPS satellites on the dayside of the Earth. The time
profile of TEC responses is similar to the time behavior of hard X-ray emission
variations during flares in the energy range 25-35 keV if the relaxation time
of electron density disturbances in the ionosphere of order 50-100 s is
introduced. No such effect on the nightside of the Earth has been detected yet.
