the formation and early evolution of a subgroup of planetary nebulae that
exhibit a variety of point-symmetric structures. For bipolar nebulae, the
formation of point-symmetric nebular shapes along the inner borders of their
opposing lobes and/or collimated outflows or jets internal or external to their
cavities, is reproduced by considering a steady misalignment of the magnetic
collimation axis with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar wind outflow,
defined perpendicular to the equatorial density enhancement. Elliptical
planetary nebulae with ansae displaced from the symmetry axis in
point-symmetric fashion are reproduced through the same process by reducing the
equatorial density enhancement. This mechanism represents an alternative
explanation to some cases where morphological appearances give the impression
of the action of a symmetric, rotating or precessing jet from the central
source. The computational survey reveals that jet formation is detected only
for dense enough winds with mass loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$ \Moy. For lower
mass loss rates the jets tend to vanish leaving behind only ansae-like
structures at the tips of the lobes, as observed in some cases. The results are
rather independent of the wind terminal velocity, since magnetized bubbles
behave adiabatically for low wind velocities ($\simeq$ $100 \kms$), which in
the absence of a magnetic field would behave as momentum driven.

fairly typical double-shelled elliptical, but with a bright arc at one end of
the major axis that is especially prominent in [NII]; this feature is probably
a collection of FLIERs. The nebula is surrounded by a faint, smooth elliptical
halo, which appears undisturbed by any interaction with the interstellar
medium. Adopting Teff = 40,000 +- 3,000 K based upon published spectral-line
analyses, and employing our new broad-band optical flux data along with the

of 0.60 +- 0.02 M_sun for this luminosity, which is significantly higher than
the mean mass of white dwarfs in globular clusters and the halo field (0.50 +-

from relativistic magnetic Compton scattering in the low-density/high-field
regime. A Monte Carlo implementation of radiation transport allows for spatial
diffusion of photons in arbitrary geometries and accounts for relativistic
angular redistribution. The cross section includes natural line widths and
photon ""spawning"" from up to fourth harmonic photons. In our first paper we
noted that even if the photon injection is isotropic a strongly anisotropic
radiation field rapidly ensues. We now investigate the angular distribution of
cyclotron spectra emerging from an internally irradiated magnetized plasma with
a prescribed global geometry (either cylindrical or plane parallel) and the
effects of anisotropic photon injection on the line shapes. Varying the input
angular distribution permits a better understanding of the line formation
process in more realistic scenarios where the radiative mechanisms are
influenced by the intrinsic anisotropy of the field and by moderate
relativistic beaming. In general, the line features are most pronounced along
the directions of the anisotropic continuum injection and tend to be weakened
in other directions, relative to the line features resulting from an isotropic
continuum injection. We find that the enhancements at the line wings of the
fundamental, which appear prominantly in the case of isotropic continuum
injection, are strongly suppressed along the direction of anisotropy in the
case of beamed continuum injection, regardless of geometry or beaming pattern.

molecular outflows whose properties are insensitive to the distribution of
ambient gas and to the details of how the wind is launched, and how its

commonly observed features of outflows.
  This model is simple enough to permit a quantitative study of the feedback
effects from low-mass star formation. It predicts the rate at which
star-forming gas is ejected by winds, and hence the efficiency with which stars
form. Applied to individual star formation, it relates the stellar initial mass
function to the distribution of pre-stellar cores. Applied to cluster
formation, it indicates whether the resulting stellar system will remain
gravitationally bound.
  Using the energy injection and mass ejection implied by this model, we
investigate the dynamical evolution of a molecular clump as a stellar cluster
forms within it. This depends critically on the rate at which turbulence
decays: it may involve equilibrium star formation (slow decay), overstable
oscillations, or collapse (fast decay).

has thin parallel dust filaments transverse to the direction of motion.
Numerical models suggest that the filaments come from flocculent spiral arms
that were present before the interaction. A dust lane at the outer edge of the
tidal tail is a shock front where the flow abruptly changes direction. A spiral
arm of NGC 2207 that is backlit by IC 2163 is seen to contain several parallel,
knotty filaments that are probably shock fronts in a density wave. Blue
clusters of star formation inside these dust lanes show density wave triggering
by local gravitational collapse. Spiral arms inside the oval of IC 2163 could
be the result of ILR-related orbits in the tidal potential that formed the
oval. Their presence suggests that tidal forces alone may initiate a temporary
nuclear gas flow and eventual starburst without first forming a stellar bar.

Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase
transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the
size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a
certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average
vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world
graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and
Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs
with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising
accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable
discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of
additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random
graph.

operators describing the interaction between the conduction electrons and
impurities or defects with internal degrees of freedom. This interaction may
involve spin or orbital variables. There are cases where the conduction
electrons have conserved quantum numbers that do not appear in the coupling. An
example is where the Kondo effect involves orbital degrees of freedom, and the
interaction is independent of the real spins of the electrons, which are
conserved and lead to the two-channel Kondo (2CK) problem. The low temperature
behavior is very different for the one- and two-channel cases, as in the first
case a Fermi liquid is formed while in the second one strong deviations appear
and a non-Fermi liquid state is realized. Mesoscopic samples provide a unique
possibility to study a few or even a single Kondo impurities. In this paper we
first review how the original spin Kondo problem is affected by surface
anisotropy and the fluctuations of the density of states in point contacts
(PCs). We discuss the physics of a single magnetic impurity on the surface of a
sample. The orbital 2CK effect due to dynamical defects is considered. The
nature of these defects is not known but they are excellent candidates to
describe the zero-bias anomalies with non-Fermi liquid character in PCs, and
the dephasing time and transport in short wires. There are two main concerns
regarding this interpretation: First, the tunneling centers formed by heavy
impurities may produce a Kondo temperature that is too low, and secondly, the
splittings seen in the experiments are much smaller than expected from this
model. It would be therefore extremely important to identify the microstructure
of these two-level systems and find new realizations for them.

the maximal extent of its free range. In the Push-1 version, the agent can only
push one block one square at a time, the minimal extent---one square. Both

treat than the former one (synchronized binary), but is expected to represent
fairly well the late evolutionary stages of a binary neutron star system. As
regards the gravitational field, an approximation of general relativity is
used, which amounts to solving five of the ten Einstein equations (conformally
flat spatial metric). The obtained system of partial differential equations is
solved by means of a multi-domain spectral method. Two spherical coordinate
systems are introduced, one centered on each star; this results in a precise
description of the stellar interiors. Thanks to the multi-domain approach, this
high precision is extended to the strong field regions. The computational
domain covers the whole space so that exact boundary conditions are set to
infinity. Extensive tests of the numerical code are performed, including
comparisons with recent analytical solutions. Finally a constant baryon number

eliminate the minimal quark-gluon interaction in the light-front quantized QCD
Hamiltonian. The coupled differential equations in the two lowest Fock sectors
correspond to the renormalization of the light-front gluon mass and the
generation of effective quark-antiquark interaction. The influence of the
renormalization of the gluon effective mass on the elimination of the
quark-gluon coupling and the induced quark-antiquark interaction is taken into
account. Namely, the original gauge field coupling can be completely
eliminated, even when the states connected by this interaction are degenerate.
Furthermore, even in the case where effective interaction, obtained within
perturbative schemes (bound state perturbation theory or perturbative
similarity approach), is not defined, we obtain more singular behavior $1/q^4$
at small gluon momenta. This is due to asymptotic behavior of the effective
gluon mass at small cutoffs. By discussing the consequences of this asymptotic
behavior, it seems that our approach is superior to perturbation theory and to
perturbative similarity approach.

noncommutative solitons in a scalar field theory on two spatial dimension and
`long stick' shaped noncommutative U(2) magnetic monopoles. However the
elongation factors of these two cases are different, and so not universal.

based on a matrix-generalization (F) of the scalar fermion-number f, predicts
that only three families of quarks and leptons, and their associated neutrinos
(nu_e, nu_mu and nu_tau), exist. Moreover, this description places important
topological constraints on neutrino mixing. For example, with respect to F, the
topology of the nu_e (nu_mu or nu_tau) is that of a cylinder (Mobius strip).
Assuming that a change in topology dudring neutrino-neutrino transitions is
suppressed (e.g., one cannot continuously deform a donut into a sphere), while
neutrino-neutrino transitions without topology-change are (relatively)
enhanced, one may have an explanation for recent short-distance experimental
observations of (nearly) maximal nu_mu-nu_tau mixing at the Super Kamiokande.
To test this idea, I was able to use simple topological arguments to deduce a
matrix describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, which is identical to that
proposed by Georgi and Glashow on different grounds. Experimental confirmation
of this prediction would strongly support the new description of fundamental
fermions, which requires, among other things, that the nu_e and (nu_mu or
nu_tau) neutrinos start life as topoligically-distinct quantum objects.

SPIRES-HEP, now indexes over 400,000 research articles, with almost 50% linked
to fulltext electronic versions (this site now has over 15 000 hits per day).
This database motivated the creation of the first site in the United States for
the World Wide Web at SLAC. With this database and the invention of the Los
Alamos E-print archives in 1991, the HEP community pioneered the trend to
""paperless publishing"" and the trend to paperless access; in other words, the
""virtual library."" We examine the impact this has had both on the way
scientists research and on paper-based publishing. The standard of work
archived at Los Alamos is very high. 70% of papers are eventually published in
journals and another 20% are in conference proceedings. As a service to
authors, the SPIRES-HEP collaboration has been ensuring that as much
information as possible is included with each bibliographic entry for a paper.
Such meta-data can include tables of the experimental data that researchers can
easily use to perform their own analyses as well as detailed descriptions of
the experiment, citation tracking, and links to full-text documents.

ionospheric impulsive disturbances, based on using data from a global network
of receivers of the GPS navigation system and requiring no a priori information
about the place and time of associated effects. The practical implementation of
the method is illustrated by a case study of earthquake effects in Turkey
(August 17, and November 12, 1999), in Southern Sumatera (June 4, 2000), and
off the coast of Central America (January 13, 2001). It was found that in all
instances the time period of the ionospheric response is 180-390 s, and the
amplitude exceeds by a factor of two as a minimum the standard deviation of
background fluctuations in total electron content in this range of periods
under quiet and moderate geomagnetic conditions. The elevation of the wave
vector varies through a range of 20-44 degree, and the phase velocity
(1100-1300 m/s) approaches the sound velocity at the heights of the ionospheric
F-region maximum. The calculated (by neglecting refraction corrections)
location of the source roughly corresponds to the earthquake epicenter. Our
data are consistent with the present views that shock-acoustic waves are caused
by a piston-like movement of the Earth surface in the zone of an earthquake
epicenter.

determining SAW parameters (including angular characteristics of the wave
vector, and the SAW phase velocity, as well as the direction towards the
source) using GPS-arrays whose elements can be chosen out of a large set of
GPS-stations of the global GPS network. The application of the method is
illustrated by a case study of ionospheric effects from launchings of launch
vehicles (LV) Proton and Space Shuttle from space-launch complexes Baikonur and
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 1998 and 1999 (a total of five launchings). The
study revealed that, in spite of a difference of LV characteristics, the
ionospheric response for all launchings had the character of an N - wave
corresponding to the form of a shock wave, regardless of the disturbance source
(rocket launchings, industrial explosions). The SAW period T is 270--360 s, and
the amplitude exceeds the standard deviation of TEC background fluctuations in
this range of periods under quiet and moderate geomagnetic conditions by
factors of 2 to 5 as a minimum. The angle of elevation of the SAW wave vector
varies from 30 degree to 60 degree, and the SAW phase velocity (900-1200 m/s)
approaches the sound velocity at heights of the ionospheric F-region maximum.

to redesign the LCLS photoinjector, that lead to the discovery of a new
effective working point for a split RF photoinjector. We consider the emittance
compensation regime of a space charge beam: by increasing the solenoid
strength, the emittance evolution shows a double minimum behavior in the
drifting region. If the booster is located where the relative emittance maximum
and the envelope waist occur, the second emittance minimum can be shifted to
the booster exit and frozen at a very low level (0.3 mm-mrad for a 1 nC flat
top bunch), to the extent that the invariant envelope matching conditions are
satisfied. Standing Wave Structures or alternatively Traveling Wave Structures
embedded in a Long Solenoid are both candidates as booster linac. A careful
measurement of the emittance evolution as a function of position in the
drifting region is necessary to verify the computation and to determine
experimentally the proper position of the booster cavities. The new design
study and supporting experimental program under way at the SLAC Gun Test
Facility are discussed.

application of the NMRQC are exponential diminishment of density-matrix
elements with the number of bits, threatening weak signal levels, and the high
cost of preparing a suitable starting state. A third obstacle is a heretofore
unnoticed restriction on measurement operators available for use by an NMRQC.
Variations on the function classes of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem are introduced,
both to extend the range of problems advantageous for quantum computation and
to escape all three obstacles to use of an NMRQC. By adapting it to one such
function class, the Deutsch-Jozsa problem is made solvable without exponential
loss of signal. The method involves an extra work bit and a polynomially more
involved Oracle; it uses the thermal-equilibrium density matrix systematically
for an arbitrary number of spins, thereby avoiding both the preparation of a
pseudopure state and temporal averaging.
