of the Gamma-Ray Burst 000418 starting 2.5 days after the occurrence of the
burst and extending over nearly seven weeks. GRB 000418 represents the second
case for which the afterglow was initially identified by observations in the
near-infrared. During the first 10 days its R-band afterglow was well
characterized by a single power-law decay with a slope of 0.86. However, at
later times the temporal evolution of the afterglow flattens with respect to a
simple power-law decay. Attributing this to an underlying host galaxy we find
its magnitude to be R=23.9 and an intrinsic afterglow decay slope of 1.22. The
afterglow was very red with R-K=4 mag. The observations can be explained by an
adiabatic, spherical fireball solution and a heavy reddening due to dust
extinction in the host galaxy. This supports the picture that (long) bursts are
associated with events in star-forming regions.

simulations of the LCDM model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant),
focusing on the Ly-alpha line luminosities of high-redshift systems. Primordial
composition gas condenses within dark matter potential wells, forming objects
with masses and sizes comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies.
As expected, the energy radiated in this process is comparable to the
gravitational binding energy of the baryons, and the total cooling luminosity
of the galaxy population peaks at z ~= 2. However, in contrast to the classical
picture of gas cooling from the \sim 10^6 K virial temperature of a typical
dark matter halo, we find that most of the cooling radiation is emitted by gas
with T < 20,000 K. As a consequence, roughly 50% of this cooling radiation
emerges in the Ly-alpha line. While a galaxy's cooling luminosity is usually
smaller than the ionizing continuum luminosity of its young stars, the two are
comparable in the most massive systems, and the cooling radiation is produced
at larger radii, where the Ly-alpha photons are less likely to be extinguished
by dust. We suggest, in particular, that cooling radiation could explain the
two large (\sim 100 kpc), luminous (L_{Ly-alpha} \sim 10^{44} erg s^{-1})
``blobs'' of Ly-alpha emission found in Steidel et al.'s (1999) narrow band
survey of a z = 3 proto-cluster. Our simulations predict objects of the
observed luminosity at about the right space density, and radiative transfer
effects can account for the observed sizes and line widths. We discuss

with a stiff (index G=3 and G=2.5) polytropic equation of state and the black
hole as a Newtonian point mass. Our initial conditions correspond to
irrotational binaries in equilibrium (approximating the NS as a compressible
ellipsoid), and we have explored configurations with different initial mass
ratios, 0.2< q=M_ns/M_bh<0.5. The dynamical evolution is followed for ~23ms. We
include gravitational radiation losses in the quadrupole approximation for a
point-mass binary. For G=3, after an initial episode of mass transfer, the NS
is not completely disrupted and a remnant core remains in orbit about the black
hole. For G=2.5 the disruption is more complex, with the NS being totally
disrupted during a second periastron passage. The accretion disc formed around
the black hole contains ~0.2 solar masses. A nearly baryon-free axis is always
present in the system, and only modest beaming of a relativistic fireball that
could give rise to a GRB would be sufficient to avoid baryon contamination.
Around 0.01 solar masses may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could
contribute substantially to the amount of observed galactic r-process material.
We calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms in the quadrupole
approximation. We also present the results of simulations that have used
spherical NSs relaxed in isolation as initial conditions, in order to gauge the
effect of using non-equilibrium initial conditions on the coalescence.

low-mass companion in a long-period orbit. Fischer, Butler and Marcy (2000)
report a long-term velocity drift indicative of such a companion. But the
system is known to be a visual binary with an eccentric orbit, and is rapidly
approaching periastron. Whether the visual companion can account for our
observations and the Fischer et al. velocity drift depends on knowing the orbit
more precisely. The stability of planetary orbits in this system also depends
crucially on the properties of the binary orbit. A second cross-correlation
feature, weaker and much more diffuse, has intensity amplitude 0.0002 continuum
units and occurs at a velocity amplitude of 71 +/-10 km/sec, in agreement with

La$_{1.2}$Sr$_{1.8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{7}$ single crystals below $T_{c}$ = 121 K. We
find that the resistivity upturn below 40 K is related to the reentrant spin
glass phase at the same temperature, accompanied by additional anomalous Hall
effects. The carrier concentration from the ordinary Hall effects remains
constant during the transition and is close to the nominal doping level (0.4
holes/Mn). The spin glass behavior comes from the competition between
ferromagnetic double exchange and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions,
which leads to phase separation, i.e. a mixture of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic clusters, representing the canted antiferromagnetic state.

amplifies this progression to expose features of manganite physics uniquely
accessible in the layered systems: (a) a ""frustrated"" region between the A and
C regimes where no long-range magnetic order is observed; (b) magnetic
polytypism arising from weak inter-bilayer magnetic exchange in the Type-C

evolution directly measures ordering of d3y2-r2 orbitals in the a-b plane. This
orbital-ordering transition is precursory to Type-C magnetic ordering, where
ferromagnetic rods lie parallel to the b-axis. These observations support the
notion that eg orbital polarisation is the driving force behind magnetic spin
ordering. Finally, in the crossover region between Type-C and Type-G states, we
see some evidence for the development of local Type-C clusters embedded in a

distribution of $\pm K$ bonds on the square lattice at finite temperature. In
the phase diagram of this model there is the so-called Nishimori line which
intersects the phase boundary at a multicritical point. It is known that the
correlation functions obey many exact identities on this line. We use a
supersymmetry method to treat the disorder. In this approach the transfer
matrices of the model on the Nishimori line have an enhanced supersymmetry
osp($2n+1|2n$), in contrast to the rest of the phase diagram, where the
symmetry is osp($2n|2n$) (where $n$ is an arbitrary positive integer). An
anisotropic limit of the model leads to a one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian
describing a chain of interacting superspins, which are irreducible
representations of the osp($2n+1|2n$) superalgebra. By generalizing this
superspin chain, we embed it into a wider class of models. These include other
models that have been studied previously in one and two dimensions. We suggest
that the multicritical behavior in two dimensions of a class of these
generalized models (possibly not including the multicritical point in the RBIM
itself) may be governed by a single fixed point, at which the supersymmetry is
enhanced still further to osp($2n+2|2n$). This suggestion is supported by a
calculation of the renormalization-group flows for the corresponding nonlinear
sigma models at weak coupling.

phase, in which the fermion eigenstates at zero energy are extended. In this
paper we argue that such behavior cannot occur in the random-bond Ising model,
by showing that the Ising spin correlations in the metallic phase violate the
bound on such correlations that results from the reality of the Ising
couplings. Some types of disorder in spinless or spin-polarized p-wave
superconductors and paired fractional quantum Hall states allow a mapping onto
an Ising model with real but correlated bonds, and hence a metallic phase is
not possible there either. It is further argued that vortex disorder, which is
generic in the fractional quantum Hall applications, destroys the ordered or
weak-pairing phase, in which nonabelian statistics is obtained in the pure

pressure and entropy to three-loop order and the screening mass to two-loop
order. In contrast to the weak-coupling expansion, the SPT-improved
approximations appear to converge even for rather large values of the coupling
constant.

events that plays a crucial role. Specifically, we prove that if nonidentical
events are consistently differentiated, Bell-type Pitowsky inequalities are no
longer violated, even for Bohm's example of two entangled spin 1/2 quantum
particles. We show how Bell inequalities can be violated in cognition,
specifically in the relationship between abstract concepts and specific
instances of these concepts. This supports the hypothesis that genuine quantum
structure exists in the mind. We introduce a model where the amount of
nonlocality and the degree of quantum uncertainty are parameterized, and
demonstrate that increasing nonlocality increases the degree of violation,
