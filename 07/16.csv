powerful AGN at z~0.2. No significant difference is detected in the richness of
the cluster environments of the radio-loud and radio-quiet sub-samples, both of
which typically inhabit environments as rich as Abell Class ~0. Comparison with
radio luminosity-matched samples from Hill & Lilly (1991) and Wold et al.
(2000a) suggests that there is no epoch-dependent change in environment
richness out to at least z>=0.5 for either radio galaxies or radio quasars.
Comparison with the APM cluster survey shows that, contrary to current
folklore, powerful AGN do not avoid rich clusters, but rather display a spread
in cluster environment which is perfectly consistent with being drawn at random
from the massive elliptical population. Finally, we argue that virtually all
Abell class ~0 clusters contained an active galaxy during the epoch of peak
quasar activity at z~2.5.
