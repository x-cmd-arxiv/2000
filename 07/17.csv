  unchanged",,"10.1086/318061",,"astro-ph",,"  Rotation curves of dark-matter-dominated galaxies measure the mass profiles
of galactic halos and thereby test theories of their cosmological origin. While
attention has focused lately on the possible discrepancy at small
galactocentric radii between observed rotation curves and the singular density
profiles predicted by N-body simulations of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model,
the observed rotation curves nevertheless contain valuable additional
information with which to test the theory and constrain the fundamental
cosmological parameters, despite this uncertainty at small radii.
  An analytical model we derived elsewhere for the postcollapse equilibrium of
cosmological halos as truncated, nonsingular, isothermal spheres (TIS)
reproduces many of the average properties of halos in CDM simulations to good
accuracy, including the density profiles outside the central region. The
circular velocity profile of this TIS model is, moreover, in excellent
agreement with the observed ones and yields the mass and formation epoch of an
observed halo from the parameters of its rotation curve. This allows us to
predict correlations amongst rotation curve parameters, such as the maximum
velocity and the radius at which it occurs, for different mass halos forming at
different epochs in the CDM model. As an example, we derive the observed
v_max-r_max relation analytically, with preference for the flat Lambda-CDM
model.

using a Monte Carlo spectrum synthesis code. Analysis of the earliest spectra
is used to determine the time of outburst. The changing features of the
spectrum and the light curve are used to probe the ejecta and to determine
their composition, verifying the results of explosion calculations. Since
synthetic spectra computed using our best explosion model CO100 are only
moderately good reproductions of the observations, the inverse approach is
adopted, and a density structure is derived by demanding that it gives the best
possible fit to the observed spectrum at every epoch analysed. It is found that
the density structure of model CO100 is adequate at intermediate velocities
(5000--25000 km/s), but that a slower density decline ($\rho \propto r^{-4}$)
is required to obtain the extensive line blending at high velocities
(25000--50000 km/s). The `best fit' density distribution results in somewhat
different parameters for the SN, namely an ejecta mass of 9.6$M_\odot$ and an
explosion kinetic energy of 1.75 x 10^{52} erg. The modified density structure
is used to compute a synthetic light curve, which is found to agree very well
with the observed bolometric light curve around maximum. The amount of
radioactive $^{56}$Ni produced by the SN is confirmed at 0.13$M_\odot$. In the
context of an axisymmetric explosion, a somewhat smaller kinetic energy than
that of SN 1998bw may have resulted from the non alignment of the symmetry axis
of the SN and the line of sight. This might also explain the lack of evidence
for a Gamma Ray Burst correlated with SN 1997ef.

in the rest-frame and hence several rovibrational H2, H recombination and
[FeII] emission lines. The lines are spatially extended by up to 6kpc from the
nucleus, but their distinct kinematics indicate that the three groups (H, H2
and [FeII]) are not wholly produced in the same gas. The broadest line,
[FeII]1.644, exhibits a non-gaussian profile with a broad base (FWHM=1040
km/s), perhaps due to interaction with the radio source. Extinctions to the
line-emitting regions substantially exceed earlier measurements based on
optical H recombination lines.
  Hard X-rays from the quasar nucleus are likely to dominate the excitation of
the H2 emission. The results of Maloney, Hollenbach and Tielens (1996) are thus
used to infer the total mass of gas in H2 v=1-0 S(1)-emitting clouds as a
function of radius, for gas densities of 10^3 and 10^5 cm^-3, and stopping
column densities N_H=10^22-10^24 cm^-2. Assuming azimuthal symmetry, at least
2.3E8 Msun of such material is present within 5kpc of the nucleus, if the
line-emitting clouds see an unobscured quasar spectrum. Alternatively, if the
bulk of the X-ray absorption to the nucleus inferred by Ueno et al. (1994)
arises in a circumnuclear torus, the implied gas mass rises to 10^10 Msun. The
latter plausibly accounts for 10^9 yr of mass deposition from the cluster
cooling flow, for which Mdot \simeq 10 Msun/yr within this radius.

results, we use a model which correctly predicts colours, number counts and
redshift distributions for the faint galaxy population. We find that at fixed
separation the amplitude of $\omega(\theta)$ measured in $BRI$ bandpasses is
lower than the predictions of a model containing with no luminosity evolution
and stable clustering growth in proper co-ordinates. However, in the
near-infrared bandpasses, our measurements are consistent with the predictions
of an essentially non-evolving $K-$ selected galaxy redshift distribution. In
the range $B\sim27-28$ we find that our correlation amplitudes are independent
of magnitude, which is consistent with the observed flattening of the number
count slope and correspondingly slower increase of the cosmological volume
element expected at these magnitudes. Our measurements in all bandpasses are
consistent with a rapid growth of galaxy clustering ($0 < \epsilon < 2 $ in the
normal parametrisation) on the sub-Mpc scales which our survey probes. We
demonstrate that this rapid growth of clustering is consistent with the
predictions of biased models of galaxy formation, which indicate that a rapid
rate of clustering growth is expected for the intrinsically faint galaxies
which dominate our survey.

information on their progenitor models. At present, however, there are few

science driver for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) is the study of
such very distant supernovae. In this paper we discuss strategies for finding
and counting distant SNe by using repeat imaging of super-critical intermediate
redshift clusters whose mass distributions are well-constrained via modelling
of strongly-lensed features. For a variety of different models for the star
formation history and supernova progenitors, we estimate the likelihood of
detecting lensed SNe as a function of their redshift. In the case of a survey
conducted with HST, we predict a high probability of seeing a supernova in a
single return visit with either WFPC-2 or ACS, and a much higher probability of
detecting examples with z>1 in the lensed case. Most events would represent
magnified SNe II at z~1, and a fraction will be more distant examples. We
discuss various ways to classify such events using ground-based infrared
photometry. We demonstrate an application of the method using the HST archival
data and discuss the case of a possible event found in the rich cluster AC 114

for the Anderson impurity model with finite Coulomb interaction, derivable from
a Luttinger Ward functional. It contains an infinite series of skeleton
diagrams built out of fully renormalized Green's functions. The choice of
diagrams is motivated by the Schrieffer Wolff transformation which shows that
singly and doubly occupied states should appear in all bare diagrams
symmetrically. Our numerical results for $T_K$ are in excellent agreement with
the exact values known from the Bethe ansatz solution. The low energy physics
of non-Fermi liquid Anderson impurity systems is correctly described while the
present approximation fails to describe Fermi liquid systems, since some
important coherent spin flip and charge transfer processes are not yet
included. It is believed that CTMA (Conserving T-matrix approximation) diagrams
will recover also Fermi liquid behavior for Anderson models with finite Coulomb
interaction as they do for infinite Coulomb interaction.

large class of highly correlated systems has previously been demonstrated to
fall on a single non-Gaussian ""universal"" curve. We derive the functional form
of the ""global"" PDF in terms of the ""source"" PDF of the individual events in
the system. A single parameter distinguishes the global PDF and is related to
the exponent of the source PDF. When normalized, the global PDF is shown to be
insensitive to this parameter and importantly we obtain the previously
demonstrated ""universality"" from an uncorrelated Gaussian source PDF. The
second and third moments of the global PDF are more sensitive, providing a
powerful tool to probe the degree of complexity of physical systems.

a comprehensive, self-consistent picture of the nature of the first
electron-removal state in this model undoped CuO_2-plane cuprate. Firstly, we
show a strong dependence on the polarization of the excitation light which is
understandable in the context of the matrix element governing the photoemission
process, which gives a state with the symmetry of a Zhang-Rice singlet.
Secondly, the strong, oscillatory dependence of the intensity of the Zhang-Rice

interference effects connected with the periodicity of the crystal structure in
the crystallographic c-direction. Thirdly, we measured the dispersion of the
first electron-removal states along G->(pi,pi) and G->(pi,0), the latter being
controversial in the literature, and have shown that the data are best fitted

theory (MFT) around a dynamical instability. Using a density matrix formalism,
we derive equations of motion which go beyond MFT and provide accurate
predictions for the quantum break-time. The leading quantum corrections appear
as decoherence of the reduced single-particle quantum state.

our scheme for SU(1,1) states, the input field passes through a non-degenerate
parametric amplifier and one measures the probability of finding the output
state with a certain number (usually zero) of photons in each mode. The density
matrix in the Fock basis is retrieved from the measured data by least squares
method after singular value decomposition of the design matrix. Several
illustrative examples involving the reconstruction of a pair coherent state, a
Perelomov coherent state, and a coherent superposition of pair coherent states
are considered.

application, the preparation of single-mode quantum states using an optical
feedback loop is discussed, with special emphasis of Fock state preparation.
For that example, the influence of non-perfect detection and feedback is also
considered.

quartic double well with harmonic driving coupled to a sea of harmonic
oscillators) the rate of entropy production has, as a function of time, two
relevant regimes: For short times it is proportional to the diffusion
coefficient (fixed by the system--environment coupling strength). For longer
times (but before equilibration) there is a regime where the entropy production
rate is fixed by the Lyapunov exponent. The nature of the transition time
between both regimes is investigated.
