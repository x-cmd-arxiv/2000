oscillations (QPOs) from nearly twenty different neutron-star low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). These frequencies often appear as a pair of kilohertz QPOs in
a given power density spectrum. In many models the higher-frequency of these
QPOs is a beaming oscillation at the frequency of a nearly circular orbit at
some radius near the neutron star. In such models it is expected that there
will also be beaming oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and at
overtones of the orbital frequency, but no strong QPOs have been detected at
these frequencies. We therefore examine the processes that can attenuate
beaming oscillations near neutron stars, and in doing so extend the work on
this subject that was initiated by the discovery of lower-frequency QPOs from
LMXBs. Among our main results are (1)in a spherical scattering cloud, all
overtones of rotationally modulated beaming oscillations are attenuated
strongly, not just the even harmonics, and (2)it is possible to have a
relatively high-amplitude modulation near the star at, e.g., the stellar spin
frequency, even if no peak at that frequency is detectable in a power density
spectrum taken at infinity. We discuss the application of these results to
modeling of kilohertz QPOs.

seven stars were observed at two epochs in 1997; two stars, RHy 42 and RHy 403,

the non-detection of a secondary peak in the cross-correlation function,
implies 0.095 > M_2 > 0.06 M (Sun), and the strong possibility that the
companion is the first Hyades brown dwarf to be identified. Unfortunately, the
maximum expected angular separation in the system is only 0.25 mas. Five other
low-mass Hyads are identified as possible spectroscopic binaries, based either
on repeat observations or comparison between the observed radial velocity and
the value expected for Hyades cluster members. Combined with HST imaging data,
we infer a binary fraction between 23 and 30 . All of the stars are
chromospherically active. RHy 281 was caught in mid-flare and, based on that

chi-squares for model D I profiles that included not only the N(D I) as a free

error which could also be varied. For both stars, H I column densities were
measured by analyzing Ly-alpha absorption profiles in a large number of IUE

now detected at fluxes below 10^(-15) erg s^(-1) cm^(-2) contribute (4.0 +-

to a fraction of 60-80% of the total measured background. This result confirms

by stars more massive than 100 solar masses is larger by about an order of

II, than the emission from a standard initial mass function. This would result
in unusually strong hydrogen and helium recombination lines from the

hole candidate source GRS 1915+105 during its spectral state transition
observed in 1997 March - August. The source was making a slow transition from a
low-hard state to a high-soft state in about three months and during this
transition it was exhibiting a series of fast variations which can be
classified as bursts. During one type of bursts, called the irregular bursts,
it was found that the source makes rapid transitions between two intensity
states. We have analyzed the RXTE PCA data obtained on 1997 June 18 (when the
source was making rapid state transitions) and compared the results with two
sets of data each pertaining to the low hard-state and high-soft states. We
find that the power density spectrum (PDS) during the burst shows remarkable
similarity to that seen during the high-soft state of the source. The PDS
during the quiescence, on the other hand, is quite flat and is very similar to
the PDS commonly seen during the canonical low-hard state of black hole X-ray
binaries. A low frequency QPO at $\sim$3 Hz is observed during the quiescence,
a property seen during the low-hard state of the source. The X-ray spectrum of
the source during quiescence is similar to the spectrum seen during the
low-hard state of the source and the spectra during the burst and high-soft
state are very similar to each other. These observations corroborate the
suggestion made by Yadav et al. (1999) that during the irregular bursts the
source shows spectral state variations at very fast time scales. We explain
such fast state changes using the two component accretion flow model in which
the accretion disk consists of a geometrically thin (and optically thick)
standard disk co-existing with an advection dominated hot thick disk.

this study is the Fundamental Plane (FP), a tight empirical correlation between
their central velocity dispersion (sigma), effective radius (Re), and effective
surface brightness (SBe), which is observed to hold in the local Universe.
Using HST-WFPC2 archive images and spectra obtained at the ESO-3.6m telescope
we measured the FP parameters for a sample of ~30 field E/S0s at z=0.2-0.4.
Remarkably, field E/S0s at intermediate redshift also define a tight FP, with
scatter unchanged with respect to that of local samples. The intermediate
redshift FP is offset from the local one, in the sense that, for given RE and
sigma, galaxies are brighter at z=0.4 than at z=0. The implication of the
offset of the FP in terms of passive evolution of the stellar population
depends on its star formation history. In a single burst scenario, the stellar
populations of field E/S0s were formed at z=0.8-1.6 (Omega=0.3;
Omega_{Lambda}=0.7; H_0=50 km/s/Mpc). Alternatively, the bulk of stars (90% in
mass) can be formed at high redshift (z~3), and the rest in a secondary burst
occurred more recently (z~0.5-0.8).

development of the subject of advective accretion in last twenty five years
leading to the global solutions and their applications. It also shows that
apart from the standard Keplerian disk features in most part of the accretion
flow, future models must incorporate the essential features of the advective
disks, such as the advection of energy and entropy by the flow, centrifugal
barrier supported boundary layer of a black hole, steady and non-steady shocks,
the bulk motion Comptonization of matter close to the black hole, outflows from
the centrifugal barrier etc. Since black holes are `black', methods of their
identification must be indirect, and therefore, the solutions must be known
very accurately. On the horizon, matter moves supersonically, but just before
that it is subsonic due to centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer or
CENBOL where much of the infall energy is released and outflows are generated.
In this review, we show that advective flow models treat accretion and winds
onto black holes and neutron stars in the same footing. Similarly treated are
the steady and time-dependent behaviour of the boundary layers of neutron stars

powerful extragalactic radio sources of type FRII is constructed. Bulk backflow
and energy losses of the relativistic electrons, radiative and adiabatic, are
self-consistently taken into account. Thus the model is an extension of
spectral aging methods including the underlying source dynamics into the age
estimates. The discrepancies between spectral ages and dynamical ages arising
from earlier methods are resolved. It is also shown that diffusion of
relativistic particles within the cocoon is unlikely to significantly change
the particle spectrum and thus the emitted radio spectrum. Projection along the
line of sight yields 1 or 2-dimensional surface brightness distributions which
can be compared with observations. From the model parameters constraints on the
source age, the density of the source environment and the angle to the line of
sight can be derived. Application of the method to Cygnus A, 3C 219 and 3C 215
show that the method provides robust estimates for the model parameters for
sources with comparatively regularly shaped radio lobes. The resolution of the
radio maps required is only moderate. Within the large uncertainties for the
orientation angle, the three example sources are found to be consistent with
orientation-based unification schemes of radio-loud AGN. In the case of Cygnus
A the gas density of the environment is found to agree with independent X-ray
measurements. For 3C 219 and 3C 215 the densities derived from the model are
apparently too low. It is suggested that these discrepancies are caused by
overestimates of slope and core radius of $\beta$-models for the gas density
distribution from X-ray observations for clusters hosting powerful radio
sources.

more accurate than the proper motions derived from the HIPPARCOS observations
alone. In Paper I (Wielen et al. 1999, A&A 347, 1046) we have presented a
method of combination for single stars (SI mode). The present Paper II derives
a combination method which is appropriate for an ensemble of 'apparently
single-stars' which contains undetected astrometric binaries. In this case the
quasi-instantaneously measured HIPPARCOS proper motions and positions are
affected by 'cosmic errors', caused by the orbital motions of the photo-centers
of the undetected binaries with respect to their center-of-mass. In contrast,
the ground-based data are 'mean values' obtained from a long period of
observation. We derive a linear 'long-term prediction' (LTP mode) for epochs
far from the HIPPARCOS epoch T_H ~ 1991.25, and a linear 'short-term
prediction' (STP mode) for epochs close to T_H. The most accurate prediction
for a position at an arbitrary epoch is provided by a smooth, non-linear
transition from the STP solution to the LTP solution. We present an example for
the application of our method, and we discuss the error budget of our method
for the FK6 (a combination of the FK5 with HIPPARCOS) and for the combination
catalog GC+HIP. For the basic fundamental stars, the accuracy of the FK6 proper
motions in the LTP mode is better than that of the HIPPARCOS proper motions

the size of the host galaxy.The dependence of the evolution of the GCS mass
function (GCMF), of the fraction of surviving clusters and of the ratio of the
final to initial mass in clusters on the structure of the host galaxy as well
as their variation with the galactocentric distance inside individual host
galaxies has been thoroughly investigated.After a survey over a large number of
different host galaxies we have restricted our attention to a sample of
galaxies with effective masses and radii equal to those observed for
dwarf,normal and giant ellipticals. We show that, in spite of large differences
in the fraction of surviving clusters, the final mean masses of the GCMF in
massive galaxies are very similar to each other with a small galaxy-to-galaxy
dispersion;low-mass compact galaxies tend to have smaller values of the final
mean mass and a larger galaxy-to-galaxy dispersion. These findings are in
agreement with those of recent observational analyses. The fraction of
surviving clusters increases with the mass of the host galaxy. We show that a
small difference between the initial and the final mean mass and dispersion of
the GCMF and the lack of a significant radial dependence of the mean mass
inside individual galaxies do not necessarily imply that evolutionary processes
have been unimportant in the evolution of the initial population of clusters.
For giant galaxies most disruption occurs within the effective radius while for

exponentially over a distance equal to the zero field correlation length of the
infinite chain. The total magnetic moment associated to each staggered term is
found to be about half of the original single-spin magnitude and to decrease as
the inverse of temperature (i.e. to behave as a Curie-like moment). The
numerical results are compared to recent NMR findings in spinless-doped

massive complex scalar field in spherical symmetry. We construct Type I
critical solutions dynamically by tuning a one-parameter family of initial data
composed of a boson star and a massless real scalar field. The real field is
used to perturb the boson star via a gravitational interaction which results in
a {\em significant} transfer of energy. The resulting critical solutions, which
show great similarity with unstable boson stars, persist for a finite time
before dispersing or forming a black hole. We extend the stability analysis of
Gleiser and Watkins [Nucl. Phys. B319, 733 (1989)], providing a method for
calculating the radial dependence of boson star modes of nonzero frequency. We
find good agreement between our critical solutions and boson star modes. For
critical solutions less than 90% of the maximum boson star mass $M_{\rm max}
\simeq 0.633 M_{Pl}^2/m$, a small halo of matter appears in the tail of the
solution. This halo appears to be an artifact of the collision between the
original boson star and the real field, and does not belong to the true
critical solution. It seems that unstable boson stars are unstable to dispersal
in addition to black hole formation. Given the similarity in macroscopic
stability between boson and neutron stars, we suggest that neutron stars at or
beyond the point of instability may also be unstable to explosion.

metric and irrotational velocity field for the neutron stars. We adopt the
polytropic equation of state. The computation is performed for the polytropic
index n(=0.5, 0.66667, 0.8, 1, 1.25), and compactness of neutron stars
M/R(=0.03 - 0.3). Results of this paper are as follows. (i) The sequences of
the irrotational binary are always terminated at an innermost orbit where a
cusp (inner Lagrange point)appears at the inner edges of the stellar surface.
The binaries with cusps are found to be dynamically unstable for n=0.5 and
stable for n > 0.8 irrespective of M/R < 0.2. For n=0.66667, the stability
changes depending on M/R. (ii) The gravitational wave frequency at the
innermost orbit turns out to be between 800 and 1500 Hz for realistic
compactness 0.14 < M/R < 0.2. (iii) The ISCO for n=0.5 appears to be determined
by a hydrodynamic instability for M/R < 0.2. We derive fitting formulae for the
relation between the orbital angular velocity at the ISCO and the compactness
to clarify it. (iv) The maximum density of neutron stars in binary systems
slightly decreases with decreasing the orbital separation and hence they are
stable against individual radial collapse during the inspiral. (v) q =
J_tot/M_ADM^2 at the innermost orbits is always less than unity for M/R > 0.13
irrespective of n, which indicates that the realistic binary neutron stars
satisfy a necessary condition (q<1) for formation of a black hole before the
merger. (vi) The specific angular momentum of any mass element in irrotational
binary neutron stars at the innermost orbit appears to be too small to form a
disk around black holes formed after the merger.

been considered in the literature because mass splittings within the gravity

expansion in two measures: S=\intd^{4}x[\Phi L_{1}+\sqrt{-g}L_{2}] where the
new measure \Phi is defined using the third-rank antisymmetric tensor. In the
new variables (Einstein frame) all equations of motion take canonical GR form
and therefore models are free of the well-known ""defects"" that distinguish the
Brans-Dicke type theories from GR. All novelty is revealed only in an unusual
structure of the effective potential U(\phi) and interactions which turns over
intuitive ideas based on our experience in field theory. E.g. the greater
\Lambda we admit in L_{2}, the smaller U(\phi) will be in the Einstein picture.
Field theory models are suggested with explicitly broken global continuos
symmetry which in the Einstein frame has the form \phi\to\phi+const. The
symmetry restoration occurs as \phi\to\infty. A few models are presented where
U is produced with the following shape: for \phi<-M_{p}, U has the form typical
for inflation model, e. g. U=\lambda\phi^4 with \lambda\sim 10^{-14};
for\phi>-M_{p}, U has mainly exponential form U\sim e^{-a\phi/M_{p}} with
variable a: a=14 for -M_{p}<\phi<M_{p} that admits nucleosynthesis; a=2 for
\phi>M_{p} that implies quintessence era. There is no need in any fine tuning
to prevent appearance of the CC term or any other terms that could violate
flatness of U at \phi\ggM_{p}. \lambda\sim 10^{-14} is obtained without fine
tuning as well. Quantized matter fields models, including gauge theories with
SSB can be incorporated without altering mentioned above results. Direct
fermion-inflaton coupling resembles Wetterich's model but it does not lead to

embeddings of F and L into a larger C*-algebra E, such that the states on L
extend uniquely to F, and this extension defines a norm continuous affine
bijection between S_0 and the whole state space of L. The main examples (but
not the only ones) are group and covariance algebras. Here we study existence
questions of a host algebra for a given pair (F,S_0), we show that if a host
algebra exists, we can do integral decompositions of states in S_0 in terms of
other states in S_0, and we show that if one does induction of representations
via host algebras one stays within the class of representations with the right
continuity properties w.r.t. S_0. Moreover, if S_0 is a folium, then up to a
central algebra one can always construct a host algebra, but this central
algebra can be an obstruction to the existence of a host algebra. These results
should be interesting to anyone who wants to construct group algebras for
general topological groups, and they are also useful for quantum physics due to
some selection criteria for physically acceptable states.

systematic procedure is proposed to handle a number of boundary conditions
which occur in practical applications. The unified features of the DSC
algorithm for solving differential equations are explored from the point of
view of the method of weighted residuals. It is demonstrated that different
methods of implementation for the present algorithm, such as global, local,
Galerkin, collocation, and finite difference, can be deduced from a single
starting point. Both the computational bandwidth and the accuracy of the DSC
algorithm are shown to be controllable. Three example problems are employed to
illustrate the usefulness, test the accuracy and explore the limitation of the
DSC algorithm. A Galerkin-induced collocation approach is used for a waveguide
analysis in both regular and irregular domains and for electrostatic field
estimation via potential functions. Electromagnetic wave propagation in three
spatial dimensions is integrated by using a generalized finite difference
approach, which becomes a global-finite difference scheme at certain limit of
DSC parameters. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is a
promising approach for solving problems in electromagnetics.

environment and in high magnetic fields. The radiation tolerance of silicon
improves by cooling it to temperatures below 180 K. At low temperatures the
mobility increases, which leads to larger deflections of the charge carriers by
the Lorentz force. A good knowledge of the Lorentz angle is needed for design
and operation of silicon detectors. We present measurements of the Lorentz
angle between 77 K and 300 K before and after irradiation with a primary beam
of 21 MeV protons.

luminosity environment requires that the crystals are well calibrated and

calorimeter to enable it to make CP violation measurements in the $B$ meson
system. To achieve this goal a fibre-optic light pulser system was designed
using xenon flash lamps as the light source. A novel light distribution method
was developed using an array of graded index microlenses. Some initial results

integrated X-Ray Laser Facility is basically a FODO structure with constant
beta-function. There are more than 800 individually powered superconducting
quadrupoles to focus the beam in the two main linear accelerators (each with a
length of 15 km). For the availability of the beams it is important that a
power supply failure or even a magnet failure does not cause a significant down
time of the linac. It is demonstrated that the beta-function can be matched
with a quadrupole ""missing"". One part of the main linac (up-to 50 GeV) will be
used to accelerate the High Energy Physics beam and the Free Electron Laser
drive beam with different accelerating gradients. Therefore the betatron phase
advance will be 60 deg. or 90 deg. depending on the beam energy. It is shown
that even in that case it is possible to match the lattice simultaneously for
both beams with a quadrupole missing.

  Part 1 of the paper is an introduction the to the concept of the qubit.
  Part 2 gives an introduction to quantum mechanics covering such topics as
Dirac notation, quantum measurement, Heisenberg uncertainty, Schrodinger's
equation, density operators, partial trace, multipartite quantum systems, the
Heisenberg versus the Schrodinger picture, quantum entanglement, EPR paradox,
quantum entropy.
  Part 3 gives a brief introduction to quantum computation, covering such
topics as elementary quantum computing devices, wiring diagrams, the no-cloning
theorem, quantum teleportation, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm.
  Many examples are given. A table of contents as well as an index are provided

straightforward scheme for classifying all 2-q-bit states; four of the classes
consist of two subclasses each. The simple criteria that we stated recently for
checking a given state's positivity and separability are justified, and we
discuss some important properties of Lewenstein-Sanpera decompositions. An
upper bound is conjectured for the sum of the degree of separability of a
2-q-bit state and its concurrence.

an axis chosen at random. If, on the other hand, the second player is forced to
behave ``classically'' by reducing the wave function, then the first play
retains an advantage, which the second player may eliminate by repeated
measurement using randomly selected bases.

gained widespread attention after their application to quantum Hall effect. In
a particular gauge, the holomorphic gauge, they give a physical implementation
of Bargmann's Hilbert space of entire functions. They have also been recognized
as a natural bridge between Feynman's path integral and Geometric Quantization.
We discuss here some mathematical subtleties involved in the formulation of the
problem when one tries to study quantum mechanics on a finite strip of sides
L_1, L_2 with a uniform magnetic field and periodic boundary conditions. There
is an apparent paradox here: infinitesimal translations should be associated to
canonical operators [p_x,p_y] \propto i\hslash B, and, at the same time, live
in a Landau level of finite dimension B L_1L_2/(hc/e), which is impossible from
Wintner's theorem. The paper shows the way out of this conundrum.
