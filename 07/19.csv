gravitationally lensed radio quiet quasi-stellar object (QSO) 2237+0305 at 8.9
and 11.7 microns for the first time. The mid-infrared flux ratios are
inconsistent with the optical flux ratios, but agree with the radio flux ratios
and with some published gravitational lens models. These flux ratios indicate
that the infrared emission is not affected by microlensing, which rules out the
synchrotron emission model. The infrared emission is likely produced by hot
dust extended on a length scale of more than 0.03 parsecs. The spectral energy
distribution further implies a narrow range of dust temperatures, suggesting
that the dust may be located in a shell extending between ~1 to 3 parsecs from
the nucleus, and intercepting about half of the QSO luminosity.

  Vol.549 (March 10, 2001)",,"10.1086/319455",,"astro-ph",,"  We study implications for the apparent alignment of the spin axes,
proper-motions, and polarization vectors of the Crab and Vela pulsars. The spin
axes are deduced from recent Chandra X-ray Observatory images that reveal jets
and nebular structure having definite symmetry axes. The alignments indicate
these pulsars were born either in isolation or with negligible velocity
contributions from binary motions. We examine the effects of rotation and the
conditions under which spin-kick alignment is produced for various models of
neutron star kicks. If the kick is generated when the neutron star first forms
by asymmetric mass ejection or/and neutrino emission, then the alignment
requires that the protoneutron star possesses an original spin with period
$P_s$ much less than the kick timescale, thus spin-averaging the kick forces.
The kick timescale ranges from 100 ms to 10 s depending on whether the kick is
hydrodynamically driven or neutrino-magnetic field driven. For hydrodynamical
models, spin-kick alignment further requires the rotation period of an
asymmetry pattern at the radius near shock breakout (>100 km) to be much less
than ~100 ms; this is difficult to satisfy unless rotation plays a dynamically
important role in the core collapse and explosion ($P_s\lo 1$ ms). Aligned kick
and spin vectors are inherent to the slow process of asymmetric electromagnetic
radiation from an off-centered magnetic dipole. We reassess the viability of
this effect, correcting a factor of 4 error in Harrison and Tademaru's
calculation that increases the size of the effect. To produce a kick velocity
of order a few hundred km/s requires that the neutron star be born with an
initial spin close to 1 ms and that spindown due to r-mode driven gravitational
radiation be inefficient compared to standard magnetic braking.

double power law with inner and outer exponents taking the values near -1.5 and
-3 respectively. The precise value of the inner exponent depends on the
magnitude and duration of the noisy epoch and most likely on form of the inner
profile to start. The outer exponent is the result of evolution dominated by
the external l=1 multipole resulting from the inner halo's response to noise.
  Three different noise processes are studied: (1) a bombardment by blobs of
mass small compared to the halo mass (`shrapnel'); (2) orbital evolution of
substructure by dynamical friction (`satellites'); and (3) noise caused by the
orbit of blobs in the halo (`black holes'). The power spectra in the shrapnel
and satellite cases is continuous and results in the double power law form,
independent of initial conditions. The power spectrum for black holes is
discrete and has a different form with a much slower rate of evolution. A
generic prediction of this study is that noise from transient processes will
drive evolution toward the same double power law with only weak constraints on
the noise source and initial conditions.

different spectral indices, separated by 2.815 arcsec. VLBA observations show
that each component has substructure on a scale of a few mas. A deep K-band
exposure with the W.M.Keck-II Telescope reveals emission near both radio
components. The K-band emission of the weaker radio component appears extended,
whereas the emission from the brighter radio component is consistent with a
point source. Hubble Space Telescope F160W-band observations with the NICMOS
instrument confirms this. A redshift of 2.064 is found for the brighter
component, using the LRIS instrument on the W.M.Keck-II Telescope. The
probability that B0827+525 consists of two unrelated compact flat-spectrum
radio sources is ~3%, although the presence of similar substructure in both

has met all criteria that thus far have in 100% of the cases confirmed a source
as an indisputable gravitational lens system. Despite this, no lens galaxy has
been detected with m_F160W<=23 mag. Hence, we might have found the first binary

the dramatic drop in the resistivity at the insulator-metal transition
temperature Tmi, the charge-ordering (CO) peaks exhibit no anomaly at this
temperature and continue to grow below Tmi. Our data suggest then, that in
addition to the CO phase, another insulating phase is present below Tco. In
this picture, the insulator-metal transition is due to the changes within this
latter phase. The CO phase does not appear to play a major role in this
transition. We propose that a percolation-like insulator-metal transition
occurs via the growth of ferromagnetic metallic domains within the parts of the

low-temperature phase-separated state is unstable against x-ray irradiation,
which destroys the CO phase at low temperatures.

the framework of a generic two component Ginzburg-Landau functional

including first order demixing and prewetting, continuous demixing, a
tricritical point connecting the two regimes, or a critical end point beyond

photon creates a vibrationally excited self-trapped ``orbiton'' state from the
orbitally-ordered Jahn-Teller (JT) ground state. Trapping occurs by local
oxygen rearrangement. Then the Franck-Condon mechanism activates multiphonon
Raman scattering. The amplitude of the $n$-phonon process is first order in the
electron-phonon coupling $g$. The resonance occurs {\it via} a dipole forbidden
$d$ to $d$ transition. We previously suggested that this transition (also seen
in optical reflectivity) becomes allowed because of asymmetric oxygen
fluctuations. Here we calculate the magnitude of the corresponding matrix
element using local spin-density functional theory. This calculation agrees to
better than a factor of two with our previous value extracted from experiment.
This allows us to calculate the absolute value of the Raman tensor for
multiphonon scattering. Observation of this effect would be a direct
confirmation of the importance of the JT electron-phonon term and the presence
of self-trapped orbital excitons, or ``orbitons''.

treated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy
conservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not
concerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend
crucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero. Finally,
in case of several elementary scatterings, they are not treated on the same
level: the first collision is always treated differently than the subsequent
ones. All these problems are solved in our new approach.

primary bifurcation from the uniform state is a direct transition to a state of
spatiotemporal chaos. This state is the result of the interaction of four,
degenerate traveling modes: right and left zig and zag rolls. Periodic
modulations of the driving voltage at approximately twice the traveling
frequency are used. For a large enough modulation amplitude, standing waves
that consist of only zig or zag rolls are stabilized. The standing waves
exhibit regular behavior in space and time. Therefore, modulation of the
control parameter represents a method of eliminating spatiotemporal chaos. As
the modulation frequency is varied away from twice the traveling frequency,
standing waves that are a superposition of zig and zag rolls, i.e. standing
rectangles, are observed. These results are compared with existing predictions
based on coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations.

classically conveyed information. A gedankenexperiment is presented regarding

the orientation of objects in space is not absolute.

The important cosmological milestones of the standard big babg cosmology (which
predicts cosmic deceleration) like GUT symmetry breaking epoch or radiation
matter decoupling epoch may remain more or less unchanged in the modified

all such epochs occur earlier as the universe becomes older in this case.
