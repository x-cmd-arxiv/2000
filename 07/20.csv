affect the number and properties of gravitational lenses in different
environments. Two trends dominate: lensing strongly favors early-type galaxies,
which tend to lie in dense environments, but dense environments tend to have a
larger ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies than the field. The two effects nearly
cancel, and the distribution of environments for lens and non-lens galaxies are
not substantially different (lens galaxies are slightly less likely than
non-lens galaxies to lie in groups and clusters). We predict that about 20% of
lens galaxies are in bound groups (defined as systems with a line-of-sight
velocity dispersion sigma in the range 200 < sigma < 500 km/s), and another
roughly 3% are in rich clusters (sigma > 500 km/s). Therefore at least roughly
25% of lenses are likely to have environments that significantly perturb the
lensing potential. If such perturbations do not significantly increase the
image separation, we predict that lenses in groups have a mean image separation
that is about 0.2'' smaller than that for lenses in the field and estimate that
20-40 lenses in groups are required to test this prediction with significance.
The tail of the distribution of image separations is already illuminating.
Although lensing by galactic potential wells should rarely produce lenses with
image separations theta >~ 6'', two such lenses are seen among 49 known lenses,
suggesting that environmental perturbations of the lensing potential can be
significant. Further comparison of theory and data will offer a direct probe of
the dark halos of galaxies and groups and reveal the extent to which they
affect lensing estimates of cosmological parameters.

of artificial clusters with redshifts and luminosities in the range 0.25<z<0.95
and 0.5<L_X<10x10^44 erg/s (0.5-2.0 keV). We created 1 standard and 19 varied
distribution functions, each of which assumed a different set of cluster,
cosmological and operational parameters. The parameters we varied included the
values of Omega_0, Omega_Lambda, Beta, core radius and ellipticity. We also
investigated how non-standard surface brightness profiles; cooling flows; and
the ROSAT pointing target, influence the selection function in the Bright SHARC
survey. For our standard set we adopted the parameters used during the
derivation of the Bright SHARC Cluster X-ray Luminosity Function (CXLF), i.e.
Omega_0=1, Omega_Lambda=0 and an isothermal Beta model with beta=0.67, r_c=250
kpc and e=0.15. We found that certain parameters have a dramatic effect on our
ability to detect clusters, e.g. the presence of a NFW profile or a strong
cooling flow profile, or the value of r_c and beta. Other parameters had very
little effect, e.g. the type of ROSAT target and the cluster ellipticity. We
show also that all the tested parameters have only a small influence on the
computed luminosity of the clusters except the presence of a strong cooling
flow. We conclude that the CXLF presented in Nichol et al. (1999) is robust
(under the assumption of standard parameters), but stress the importance of
cluster follow-up in order to better constrain the morphology of the distant
clusters found in the Bright SHARC and other surveys.

are calculated using a semi-analytic approach within the Press-Schechter
formalism. Motivated by our previous work, we assume that low-mass subhalos (v
< 30 km/s) can form significant populations of stars only if they accreted a
substantial fraction of their mass before the epoch of reionization. With this
assumption, the model reproduces the observed velocity function of galactic
satellites in the Local Group, solving the ``dwarf satellite problem'' without
modifying the popular LCDM cosmology. The disrupted satellites yield a stellar
distribution with a total mass and radial density profile consistent with those
observed for the Milky Way stellar halo. Most significantly, the model predicts
the presence of many large-scale, coherent substructures in the outer halo.
These substructures are remnants of individual, tidally disrupted dwarf
satellite galaxies. Substructure is more pronounced at large galactocentric
radii because of the smaller number density of tidal streams and the longer
orbital times. This model provides a natural explanation for the coherent
structures in the outer stellar halo found in the SDSS commissioning data, and
it predicts that many more such structures should be found as the survey covers
more of the sky. The detection (or non-detection) and characterization of such
structures could eventually test variants of the CDM scenario, especially those
that aim to solve the dwarf satellite problem by enhancing satellite
disruption.

restricted three-body problem and assume small Trojan libration amplitudes.
Employing an adiabatic invariant calculation, we show that Jupiter's
thirty-fold growth from a $10 M_\oplus$ core to its present mass causes the
libration amplitudes of Trojan asteroids to shrink by a factor of about 2.5 to
$\sim 40%$ of their original size. The calculation also shows that Jupiter's
radial migration has comparatively little effect on the Trojans; inward
migration from 6.2 to 5.2 AU causes an increase in Trojan libration amplitudes
of $\sim4%$. In each case, the area enclosed by small tadpole orbits, if made
dimensionless by using Jupiter's semimajor axis, is approximately conserved.
Similar adiabatic invariant calculations for inclined and eccentric Trojans
show that Jupiter's mass growth leaves the asteroid's eccentricities and
inclinations essentially unchanged, while one AU of inward migration causes an
increase in both of these quantities by $\sim 4%$. Numerical integrations
confirm and extend these analytic results. We demonstrate that our predictions

clusters have essentially experienced no-evolution since redshift $z\approx1$,

anisotropy discussed in literature could be rather small for the
dynamically-relaxed clusters. Using the softened isothermal sphere model and
the universal density profile for the mass distribution of rich clusters, we
calculate the CBR anisotropy by the time-delay effect and compare it with those
generated by the thermal and kinematic S-Z effects as well as by the transverse
motion of clusters. While it is unlikely that the time-delay effect is
detectable in the current S-Z measurement because of its small amplitude of
$10^{-6}$-$10^{-7}$ and its achromaticity, it nevertheless leads to an
uncertainty of $\sim10%$ in the measurement of the kinematic S-Z effect of
clusters. Future cosmological application of the peculiar velocity of clusters
to be measured through the S-Z effect should therefore take this uncertainty

diffuse ionized gas (DIG) and HII regions in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. We
compare our Schmidt H-alpha image to the far-ultraviolet (FUV, 1520A) image
from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). The H-alpha/FUV ratio is higher
in HII regions than in the DIG, suggesting an older population of ionizing
stars in the DIG. When compared to models of evolving stellar populations, the
N(Lyc)/FUV ratio in HII regions is consistent with a young burst, while the DIG
ratio resembles an older burst population, or a steady state population built
up by constant star formation. The UIT data is complimented with archival FUV
and optical images of a small portion of the disk of M33 obtained with WFPC2 on
HST. Using the HST FUV and optical photometry, we assign spectral types to the
stars observed in DIG and HII regions. The photometry indicates that ionizing
stars are present in the DIG. We compare the predicted ionizing flux with the
amount required to produce the observed H-alpha emission, and find that field
OB stars in the HST images can account for 40% +/- 12% of the ionization of the
DIG, while the stars in HII regions can provide 107% +/- 26% of the H-alpha
luminosity of the HII regions. We do not find any correlation between leakage
of ionizing photons and H-alpha luminosity for the HII regions in these HST
fields. If stellar photons alone are responsible for ionizing the DIG, the
current results are consistent with no or few ionizing photons escaping from
the galaxy.

freedom to sacrifice energy equi-partitioning on the relevant time-scales of
observation, and have phase transitions by separating autonomously into ergodic
sub-systems (clusters) with different characteristic time-scales and
temperatures. The details of the break-up follow uniquely from the requirement
of zero entropy for the slower cluster. Complex systems, such as the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, are found to minimise their free energy by
spontaneously decomposing into a hierarchy of ergodically equilibrating degrees
of freedom at different (effective) temperatures. This leads exactly and
uniquely to Parisi's replica symmetry breaking scheme. Our approach, which is
somewhat akin to an earlier one by Sompolinsky, gives new insight into the
physical interpretation of the Parisi scheme and its relations with other
approaches, numerical experiments, and short range models. Furthermore, our
approach shows that the Parisi scheme can be derived quantitatively and
uniquely from plausible physical principles.

no phase transition, but they show even for the three-spin model a slow
crossover to the asymptotic high-temperature behaviour for strong values of the
couplings. We also evaluated a quantity that is a measure of the degree of
non-self-averaging, and we found that it can become large for certain ranges of
the parameters and the system sizes. For the spin glass in a field the maximum
of non-self-averaging follows for given system size a line that resembles the
de Almeida-Thouless line. We conclude that non-self-averaging found in
Monte-Carlo simulations cannot be taken as evidence for the existence of a
low-temperature phase with replica-symmetry breaking. Models similar to the
three-spin model have been extensively discussed in order to provide a
description of structural glasses. Their theory at mean-field level resembles
the mode-coupling theory of real glasses. At that level the one-step replica
symmetry approach breaking predicts two transitions, the first transition being
dynamical and the second thermodynamical. Our results suggest that in real
finite dimensional glasses there will be no genuine transitions at all, but
that some features of mean-field theory could still provide some useful
insights.

have constructed a new numerical code for hydrodynamic simulation of

Einstein field equation using Cartesian coordinates with appropriate boundary
conditions. On the other hand, the hydrodynamic equations are solved in
cylindrical coordinates. Using this code, we perform simulations to study
axisymmetric collapse of rotating stars, which thereby become black holes or
new compact stars, in full general relativity. To investigate the effects of
rotation on the criterion for prompt collapse to black holes, we first adopt a
polytropic equation of state, $P=K\rho^{\Gamma}$, where $P$, $\rho$, and $K$
are the pressure, rest mass density, and polytropic constant, with $\Gamma=2$.
In this case, the collapse is adiabatic (i.e., no change in entropy), and we
can focus on the bare effect of rotation. As the initial conditions, we prepare
rigidly and differentially rotating stars in equilibrium and then decrease the
pressure to induce collapse. In this paper, we consider cases in which $q
\equiv J/M_g^2 < 1$, where $J$ and $M_g$ are the angular momentum and the
gravitational mass. It is found that the criterion of black hole formation is
strongly dependent on the angular momentum parameter $q$. For $q < 0.5$, the
criterion is not strongly sensitive to $q$; more precisely, if the rest mass is
slightly larger than the maximum allowed value of spherical stars, a black hole
is formed. However, for $q \alt 1$, it changes significantly: For $q \simeq
0.9$, the maximum allowed rest mass becomes $\sim 70$ - 80% larger than that

vetoed by means of acoustic sensors outside of the buildings. Massive
wind-borne objects such as tumbleweeds could also produce gravitational signals

mean-field improved coefficient c_sw. We have studied the unimproved definition
of the quark propagator, as well as two different tree-level O(a)-improved
propagators. The ultraviolet behavior of the free lattice propagator is studied
for each of these in order to establish which of them provides the most
reliable description of the quark propagator up to the medium momentum regime.
A general method of tree-level correction is introduced. This exploits
asymptotic freedom and removes much of the trivial lattice artifacts at medium
to high momenta. We obtain results for the quark propagator which are
qualitatively similar to those typically used in quark models. A simple
extrapolation of the infrared quark mass M(p^2=0) to the chiral limit gives
(298+/-8+/-30) MeV, which is consistent with phenomenological expectations.

the case when dilaton gets stabilized by certain strongly coupled dynamics on
the brane, or the bulk gauge symmetries are spontaneously broken by the Higgs
mechanism on the worldvolume. At distances smaller than the size of a largest
extra dimension these particles produce the force-law which decreases with
distance faster than high-dimensional gravity. For a millimeter size extra

implies discreteness of the time variable which leads to appearance of
unphysical modes and violation of unitarity even in the absence of a
star-product in the interaction terms. Thus, this conclusion holds also for
other quantum field theories with discrete time. Violation of causality, among
others, occurs also as the nonvanishing of the commutation relations between
observables at space-like distances with a typical scale of noncommutativity.
While this feature allows for a possible violation of the spin-statistics
theorem, such a violation does not rescue the situation but makes the scale of
causality violation as the inverse of the mass appearing in the considered

majorizes the usual Gromov norm on homology. This norm depends in an upper
semi-continuous way on the underlying foliation, in the geometric topology, and
can therefore be used to study the question of which foliations arise as
geometric limits of isotopy classes of other foliations. We show that this norm
is non-trivial -- i.e. it distinguishes certain taut foliations of a given
hyperbolic 3-manifold. In fact, modulo some standard conjectures, this norm
should precisely detect amongst taut foliations of closed atoroidal
3-manifolds, those whose universal covers branch in both directions.
  A homotopy-theoretic refinement gives even more information in certain cases;
in particular, we show that a taut foliation whose leaf space in the universal
cover branches in at most one direction cannot be the geometric limit of a
sequence of isotopies of a fixed taut foliation whose leaf space in the
universal cover branches in both directions. Our technology also lets us
produce examples of taut foliations which cannot be made transverse to certain
geodesic triangulations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, even after passing to a
finite cover.
  Finally, our norm can be extended to actions of fundamental groups of

algebras in a certain ``pseudotensor'' category instead of the category of
vector spaces. A pseudotensor category (as introduced by Lambek, and by
Beilinson and Drinfeld) is a category equipped with ``polylinear maps'' and a
way to compose them. This allows for the definition of Lie algebras,
representations, cohomology, etc. An instance of such a category can be
constructed starting from any cocommutative (or more generally,
quasitriangular) Hopf algebra $H$. The Lie algebras in this category are called
Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras.
  The main result of this paper is the classification of all simple and all
semisimple Lie $H$-pseudoalgebras which are finitely generated as $H$-modules.
We also start developing the representation theory of Lie pseudoalgebras; in
particular, we prove analogues of the Lie, Engel, and Cartan-Jacobson Theorems.
We show that the cohomology theory of Lie pseudoalgebras describes extensions
and deformations and is closely related to Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology. Lie
pseudoalgebras are closely related to solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter
equation, to differential Lie algebras (introduced by Ritt), and to Hamiltonian
formalism in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations. As an application of
our results, we derive a classification of simple and semisimple linear Poisson
brackets in any finite number of indeterminates.

eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor are shown to exist in various situations: there
are homogeneous examples of any complex dimension n > 1, if one eigenvalue is
negative and the other positive or zero, and of any complex dimension n > 2, if
the both eigenvalues are negative; there are non-homogeneous examples of
complex dimension 2, if one of the eigenvalues is zero. The problem of
existence of Kahler metrics whose Ricci tensor has two distinct, constant

Consequently, the irreducible homogeneous examples with negative eigenvalues
give rise to complete, Einstein, strictly almost Kahler metrics of any even

accordance to the findings of QCD lattice gauge theory. Hadrons are formed in
clusters of all sizes. Various measures are examined to quantify the

appropriately chosen measures. Since the temperature is not directly

qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation

as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a
finite number of parameters, then $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ grows logarithmically with
a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast,
power--law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite
parameter (or nonparametric) models such as continuous functions with
smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive
information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning
theory and in the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics
and dynamical systems theory. Further, in the same way that entropy provides
the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and
plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of $I_{\rm pred} (T)$
provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time
series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in different problems

measurement. All aspects of this generalised measurement scheme, including its
superiority over a standard von Neumann measurement, have been demonstrated
within 1.5% of the IDP predictions.

protocol for quantum key distribution, $\cal E$, defined as the number of
secret (i.e., allowing eavesdropping detection) bits per transmitted bit plus
qubit, is ${\cal E} \le 1$. The problem addressed here is whether the limit
${\cal E} =1$ can be achieved. It is showed that it can be done by splitting
the secret bits between several qubits and forcing Eve to have only a
sequential access to the qubits, as proposed by Goldenberg and Vaidman. A
protocol with ${\cal E} =1$ based on polarized photons and in which Bob's state
discrimination can be implemented with linear optical elements is presented.

dependent Schroedinger equation, different boundary conditions are possible.
The equation is usually solved as an ``initial value problem'', by fixing the

standard approach to ""source boundary conditions'' that fix the wave at all
times in a given region, in particular at a point in one dimension. In contrast
to the well-known physical interpretation of the initial-value-problem
approach, the interpretation of the source approach has remained unclear, since
it introduces negative energy components, even for ``free motion'', and a
time-dependent norm. This work provides physical meaning to the source method
by finding the link with equivalent initial value problems.

algorithms to improve on classical ones, Lloyd has observed recently that
Grover's quantum search algorithm can be implemented without entanglement, by
replacing multiple particles with a single particle having exponentially many
states. We explain that this maneuver removes entanglement from any quantum
algorithm. But all physical resources must be accounted for to quantify
algorithm complexity, and this scheme typically incurs exponential costs in
some other resource(s). In particular, we demonstrate that a recent
experimental realization requires exponentially increasing precision. There is,
however, a quantum algorithm which searches a `sophisticated' database (not
unlike a Web search engine) with a single query, but which we show does not
require entanglement even for multiparticle implementations.

quantum bits or qubits must be able to address and manipulate individual
qubits, to effect coherent interactions between pairs of qubits, and to read
out the value of qubits.1,2 Current methods for addressing qubits are divided
up into spatial methods, as when a laser beam is focused on an individual
qubit3,4,5 or spectral methods, as when a nuclear spin in a molecule is
addressed using NMR.6,7 The density of qubits addressable spatially is limited
by the wavelength of light, and the number of qubits addressable spectrally is
limited by spin linewidths. Here, we propose a method for addressing qubits
using a method that combines spatial and spectral selectivity. The result is a
design for quantum computation that provides the potential for a density of
quantum information storage and processing many orders of magnitude greater
than that afforded by ion traps or NMR. Specifically, this method uses an
ensemble of spectrally resolved atoms in a spectral holeburning solid. The
quantum oupling is provided by strong atom-cavity interaction. Using a thin
disc of diamond containing nitrogen-vacancy color centers as an example, we
present an explicit model for realizing up to 300 coupled qubits in a single

close to 40,000 operations before decoherence.
