B0833-45, the 89 ms pulsar associated with the Vela supernova remnant. We have
acquired two observations separated by one month to search for changes in the
pulsar and its environment following an extreme glitch in its rotation
frequency. We find a well-resolved nebula with a toroidal morphology remarkably
similar to that observed in the Crab Nebula, along with an axial Crab-like jet.
Between the two observations the flux from the pulsar is found to be steady to
within 0.75%; the 3 sigma limit on the fractional increase in the pulsar's
X-ray flux is < ~10^-5 of the inferred glitch energy. We use this limit to
constrain parameters of glitch models and neutron star structure. We do find a
significant increase in the flux of the nebula's outer arc; if associated with
the glitch, the inferred propagation velocity is > 0.7c, similar to that seen
in the brightening of the Crab Nebula wisps. We propose an explanation for the
X-ray structure of the Vela synchrotron nebula based on a model originally
developed for the Crab Nebula. In a departure from the Crab model, the
magnetization parameter ""sigma"" of the Vela pulsar wind is allowed to be of
order unity; this is consistent with the simplest MHD transport of magnetic
field from the pulsar to the nebula, where B < 4 X 10^-4 G. We review effects
that may enhance the probability of alignment between the spin axis and space
velocity of a pulsar, and speculate that short-period, slowly moving pulsars
are just the ones best-suited to producing synchrotron nebulae with such
aligned structures.

probe the structure of galaxy halos and the composition of dark matter. The
future prospects for this field are briefly discussed here. First the ability
of SN observations to differentiate between dark matter made of macroscopic
compact objects and dark matter made of microscopic particles is reviewed. Then
a new method for probing the structure of galaxy halos and galaxy cluster halos
is described. This method utilizes the correlations between foreground galaxy
light and supernova brightnesses to substantially decrease possible systematic
errors. The technique may be particularly useful for measuring the size of dark
matter halos, a measurement to which the galaxy--galaxy lensing is not well
suited, and the level of substructure in galaxy halos, a problematic prediction
of the cold dark matter model. The required observations of hundreds of SNe at
z ~ 1 are already being proposed for the purposes of cosmological parameter
estimation.

variability, using it as a mathematical tool to extract relevant parameters
such as the energy, rate and lifetimes of the flares through the analysis of
observed light curves. It is shown that in this very general framework the well
established anti-correlation between variability amplitude and wavelength can
only be understood as an effect of an underlying spectral component which
remains stable on long time-scales, and is redder than the variable component.
The formalism is applied to the B and R light curves of 42 PG quasars collected
by the Wise Observatory group. Variability indices for these data are obtained
with a Structure Function analysis. The mean number of living flares is
constrained to be in the range between 5 and 100, while their rates are found
to be of order 1--100 per yr. Monochromatic optical flare energies of
10^{46-48} erg/A and life-times of 0.5 to 3 yr are derived. Lower limits of
typically 25% are established for the contribution of a non-variable component
in the R band. The substantial diversity in these properties among quasars
invalidates simple versions of the Poissonian model in which flare energies,
lifetimes and the background contribution are treated as universal invariants.
The good correlation between the EW(H_beta) and the long term variability
amplitude is interpreted in a scenario where only the variable component
participates in the ionization of the line emitting gas. This idea is
consistent with the observed trends of the variability amplitude with lambda,
EW(HeII) and the X-ray to optical spectral index (abridged).

that interaction of both processes could generate EVOF. In addition, we analyze
the presence of Wolf Rayet features in the large sample of Bright PG-QSOs

star formation. The H2 component appears to dominate the gas mass in the inner
parts of galaxies, while the HI component dominates in the outer parts.
Observation of the CO and other lines in normal and starburst galaxies have
questioned the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and detection of CO in dwarfs have
shown how sensitive the conversion f actor is to metallicity. Our knowledge has
made great progress in recent years, because of sensitivity and spatial
resolution improvements. Large-scale CO maps of nearby galaxies are now
available, which extend our knowledge on global properties, radial gradients,
and spiral structure of the molecular ISM. Millimetric interferometers reveal
high velocity gradients in galaxy nuclei, and formation of embedded structures,
like bars within bars. Galaxy interactions are very effective to enhance gas
concentrations and trigger starbursts. Nuclear disks or rings are frequently
observed, that concentrate the star formation activity. Since the density of
starbursting galaxies is strongly increasing with redshift, the CO lines and
the mm dust emission are a privileged tool to follow evolution of galaxies and
observe the ISM dynamics at high redshift: they could give an answer about the
debated question of the star-formation history, since many massive remote
starbursts could be dust-enshrouded.

presented. The spectral range is 50 - 200 micron and the map size is 8' X 8'.
These observations suffer from severe source confusion at FIR wavelengths and
we employ a Maximum Likelihood Method for the spectro-spatial deconvolution.
The strong and fairly isolated source SMM1 FIRS1 presented a test case, whose
modelled spectral energy distribution (SED), within observational errors, is
identical to the observed one. The model results for the other infrared and
submillimetre sources are therefore likely to represent their correct SEDs.
Simulations demonstrating the reliability and potential of the developed method
support this view. For the majority of sources the peak of the SEDs is found
within the spectral range of the LWS and derived temperatures are generally
higher (>30K) than have been found by earlier deconvolution attempts using IRAS
data. SMM sizes are found to be only a few arcsec in diameter. In addition, the
SMMs are generally optically thick even at LWS wavelengths. Self-consistent
radiative transfer calculations indicates that the SMMs are optically thick out
to even longer wavelengths. Models were calculated for five sources, for which
sufficient data were available, viz. SMM 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. These models are
optically thick out to millimetre wavelengths (wavelength of unit optical depth
900 to 1400 micron). Envelope masses for these SMMs are in the range 2-6 Msun,
which is of course considerably more massive than estimates based on the
optically thin assumption. The luminosities are in the range 10-70 Lsun,
suggesting the formation of low-mass to intermediate mass stars, so that the
existence of such massive envelopes argues for extreme youth of the SMMs in the
Serpens cloud core.

- 1.73+-0.04. About 13 hours after the burst a steepening of the light-curve to
alpha_2 = -2.22+-0.04 was observed. Within the framework of current afterglow
models, we argue that the rapid initial decline, the `break' in the light
curve, and the spectral properties of the afterglow are best interpreted as
being due to a collimated ultra-relativistic jet of fixed opening angle
expanding into an inhomogeneous medium. In this scenario, we find that the
circumburst medium has a density structure that goes as r^(-2.05+-0.22). This
is characteristic of a preexisting wind expelled from a massive star. A
possible physical scenario is that the progenitor star collapsed to form a
black hole (i.e., a `collapsar'), producing the observed burst and afterglow.
However, the supernova signature expected in the light curve in such a scenario
is not detected. This either implies that the redshift of GRB980519 is greater
than 1.5 or that supernovae accompanying GRBs are not standard candles.

the complete infrared spectrum of the galaxies are modeled. The dust is

hidden in the dust its global structure can be estimated by the simple
calculations presented. ISOPHOT samples of eleven {\it active} galaxies and
seven {\it inactive} spirals are presented. The far infrared and submillimeter
spectrum of the {\it active} galaxies can be described by a single modified
black--body at a color temperature of $31.5 \pm 2.8$ K. This leads to a ratio
of infrared luminosity to gas mass, $L_{\rm IR}/M_{\rm gas}$, of $\sim 90$
L$_\odot$/ M$_\odot$. In contrast, the spectral energy distributions of {\it
inactive} spirals require, apart from warm dust of $31.8 \pm 2.8$ K, an
additional very cold component of at most $12.9\pm 1.7$ K. This implies a
$L_{\rm IR}/M_{\rm gas}$ ratio of $\sim 3$ L$_\odot$/ M$_\odot$ for the {\it

strength is not necessarily a good predictor of the amount of reflection. The
variability properties of Fe K-alpha and reflection do not necessarily scale
together and substantial decoupling of the behavior of the reprocessed flux
with respect to continuum variability is common. Such trends suggest the
presence of multiple and/or complex regions of dense matter in AGN cores and
that standard accretion disk models drastically oversimplify reality.

from laminar flow to vortex shedding carries significant practical importance.
Here we study a flow, where at high enough flow rates, vortices are generated

dimensional soap film.
  We present experimental results that demonstrate that the transition from
laminar flow to a periodic K\'arm\'an vortex street can be hysteretic, i.e.
changing the mean flow rate $\bar V$ vortices can survive at velocities lower
than the velocity needed to generate them. This is an unexpected result since
3D experiments are well described by the Hopf equation, which is incompatible
with hysteresis. Beyond that, our data cannot be satisfactorily fitted by the
generic model of hysteresis, i.e. the 5th order Landau equation. It is found
that a phenomenological model describes our experimental findings very well.
  Evidences are presented that wetting properties of the rod, mechanical
instabilities (i.e. vibrations) of the setup, and the effect of the surrounding
air are not the cause of the hysteresis. To reduce three dimensional effects,
the rod was replaced by a disk having a thickness roughly eight times that of
the film. The replacement of the rod by a disk increases the gap width and the
shedding frequency. Behaviour of the system (for instance the unstable
trajectory) in the hysteretic gap is investigated by means of transient

associated energy of a binary system of point-like masses are derived at the
third post-Newtonian (3PN) order. The derivation is based on a post-Newtonian
expansion of the metric in harmonic coordinates at the 3PN approximation. The
metric is parametrized by appropriate non-linear potentials, which are
evaluated in the case of two point-particles using a Lorentzian version of an
Hadamard regularization which has been defined in previous works.
Distributional forms and distributional derivatives constructed from this
regularization are employed systematically. The equations of motion of the
particles are geodesic-like with respect to the regularized metric. Crucial
contributions to the acceleration are associated with the non-distributivity of
the Hadamard regularization and the violation of the Leibniz rule by the
distributional derivative. The final equations of motion at the 3PN order are
invariant under global Lorentz transformations, and admit a conserved energy
(neglecting the radiation reaction force at the 2.5PN order). However, they are
not fully determined, as they depend on one arbitrary constant, which reflects
probably a physical incompleteness of the point-mass regularization. The
results of this paper should be useful when comparing theory to the
observations of gravitational waves from binary systems in future detectors

that the universe's radius is a complex quantity \hat{R} if it is regarded as
having a zero energy-momentum tensor. But we find that when the radius is real,
it contains matter. Using the Einstein-Hilbert action principle, the physical
scale factor R(t) =|\hat{R}| is obtained as equal to (R_0^{2} + t^{2})^{1/2}
with R_0 representing the finite radius of the universe at t=0. The resulting
physical picture is roughly a theoretical justification of the old Ozer-Taha
model. The new model is devoid of all cosmological problems. In particular, it
confirms the bounds on H_p, the present value of the Hubble parameter: 0.85 <
H_p t_p < 1.91 and faces no age problem. We argue that the total energy density
consists of parts corresponding to relativistic/non-relativistic matter, a
positive vacuum energy and a form of matter with equation of state p_K = -(1/3)
rho_K (textures or generally K-matter), and the following predictions are made
for the present nonrelativistic era: Omega_{M,n.rel.} \approx 2/3,
Omega_{V,n.rel.} \approx 1/3, Omega_ <<1, Omega_K \approx 1, where a parameter
corresponding to K-matter is taken to be unity. It is shown that the spacetime
with complex metric has signature changing properties. Using quantum
cosmological considerations, it is shown that the wave function is peaked about
the classical contour of evolution and the minimum radius R_0 of the
nonsingular model is predicted as comparable with the Planck length.

of all the aforementioned puzzles in the standard model and has very good
predictions. In the first two chapters of the thesis, we review the general
theory of relativity, the standard model in cosmology, its successes, the
problems in it and also the most successful of those attempts to solve them,
namely, the inflationary and decaying vacuum models. In the third chapter, we
present and discuss the new cosmological model in detail. The fourth chapter is
concerned with quantum cosmology. We briefly review the canonical quantisation
programme of solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, then apply the procedure to
our model and show that it satisfies many of the much sought-after ideals of
this formalism. The last chapter of the thesis compares the new model with
other ones. It also discusses the appearance of a Casimir type negative energy
density in it and the prospects and challenges ahead for the model.

and partially cancel. As the Odderon is predicted to have a rather high
trajectory it has to involve small coupling constants. As this suppression is

irrational, determines the nature of the resulting theory under $SL(2,Z)$ as
well as its properties such as the coupling constant and the number of
noncommutative directions. In particular, a strongly coupled theory with an
irrational value of axion can never be physically equivalent to a weakly
coupled theory while this is usually true for a theory with a rational value of
axion. A noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) (resulting from D3 branes with pure
magnetic flux) is physically equivalent to a noncommutative open string (NCOS)
but if the value of axion is irrational, we also have noncommutative
space-space directions in addition to the usual noncommutative space-time
directions for NCOS. We also find in general that a NCOS cannot be physically
equivalent to a NCYM but to another NCOS if the value of axion is irrational.
We find another new decoupling limit for possible light-like NCYM whose
$SL(2,Z)$ duality is a light-like ordinary Yang-Mills if the value of the axion
is rational. Various related questions are also discussed.

unexpectedly large. In some cases, these geometrically defined families can be
described explicitly, leading to new examples of special Lagrangian
submanifolds. In other cases, these conditions characterize already known
families in a new way. For example, the examples of Lawlor-Harvey constructed
for the solution of the angle conjecture and recently generalized by Joyce turn
out to be a natural and easily described second order family.

perfect information stochastic stage game. The problem is to find strategies
maximizing the probability of some expected utility. I only solve a player's
round against providence, a problem of fate stochastic management: beyond the
backward induction solution, bounded complexity motivates heuristic policies.
For a unique goal utility, a simple optimal policy, ratchet, is obtained. Its
result probabilities are compiled and used, for arbitrary utilities, as the
logic of goal identification policies. Various policies appear, close to human
behavior, and are exactly evaluated by solving the Kolmogorov equation.

recent heated debate, is addressed. Concepts of the mixed state and
entanglement are examined, and the data in a 2 qubit liquid NMR quantum
computation are analyzed. It is pointed out that the key problem in the current
debate is the understanding of entanglement in a mixed state system. The
following points are concluded in this Letter: 1)Density matrix describes the
""state"" of an average particle in an ensemble. It can not describe the state of
an individual particle in an ensemble in detail; 2) Entanglement is a property
of the wave function of a quantum particle(such as an molecule in a liquid NMR
sample). Separability of the density matrix can not be used to measure the
entanglement of mixed ensemble; 3)The evolution of states in bulk-ensemble NMR
quantum computation is quantum mechanical; 4) The coefficient before the
effective pure state density matrix, $\epsilon$, is an measure of the
simultaneity of the molecules in an ensemble. It reflects the intensity of the
NMR signal and has no significance in quantifying the entanglement in the bulk
ensemble NMR system. We conclude that the liquid NMR quantum computation is
genuine, not just classical simulations.
