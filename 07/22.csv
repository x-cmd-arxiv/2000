statistic (Mighell 1999, ApJ, 518, 380) for the determination of the
goodness-of-fit between theoretical models and low-count Poisson-distributed
data. I demonstrate that these statistics should not be used to determine the
goodness-of-fit with data values of 10 or less. I modify the chi-square-gamma
statistic for the purpose of improving its goodness-of-fit performance. I
demonstrate that the modified chi-square-gamma statistic performs (nearly) like
an ideal chi-square statistic for the determination of goodness-of-fit with
low-count data. On average, for correct (true) models, the mean value of
modified chi-square-gamma statistic is equal to the number of degrees of
freedom (nu) and its variance is 2*nu --- like the chi-square distribution for
nu degrees of freedom. Probabilities for modified chi-square-gamma
goodness-of-fit values can be calculated with the incomplete gamma function. I
give a practical demonstration showing how the modified chi-square-gamma
statistic can be used in experimental astrophysics by analyzing simulated X-ray
observations of a weak point source (signal-to-noise ratio of 5.2; 40 photons
spread over 317 pixels) on a noisy background (0.06 photons per pixel).
Accurate estimates (95% confidence intervals/limits) of the location and

new instruments optimized to EeV energy are required to do this important

have sensitivity over the full solid angle, including the horizon where most of

self-gravitational hydrodynamics with AMR using a barotropic equation of state

state. We examine several properties of the resulting protostellar fragments
and discuss the qualitative nature of the fragmentation process in realistic

formation of misaligned binary systems; and the role played by filament
formation in the formation of stars.

function for Hamiltonians describing undressing transitions in the normal and

the normal state, the spectral function evolves from predominantly incoherent

halved) with increasing irradiation dose \Phi (up to about 220 MR) is observed:
T_c decreases at low doses (\Phi \leq 50 MR) from initial value (\approx 93 K)

repulsive interactions fall into two different universality classes. One of
them has nonsingular response functions in the charge sector, while the other
is characterized by the splitting of the Van Hove singularity. At the level of
marginal perturbations, the Hubbard model turns out to be at the boundary
between the two universality classes, while extended models with
nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions belong to the latter class. In the case
of open systems allowed to exchange particles with a reservoir, we show the
existence of a range of fillings forbidden above and below the Van Hove

that two massive test bodies orbiting a central spinning mass in its equatorial
plane along two identical circular trajectories, but in opposite directions,
take different times in describing a full revolution with respect to an
asymptotically inertial observer. In the field of the Earth such time shift
amounts to 10^{-7} s. Detecting it by means of a space based mission with
artificial satellites is a very demanding task because there are severe
constraints on the precision with which the radial and azimuthal positions of a
satellite must be known: delta r= 10^{-2} cm and delta phi= 10^{-2}
milliarcseconds per revolution. In this paper we assess if the systematic
errors induced by various non-gravitational perturbations allow to meet such
stringent requirements. A couple of identical, passive laser-ranged satellites
of LAGEOS type with their spins aligned with the Earth's one is considered. It
turns out that all the non vanishing non-gravitational perturbations induce
systematic errors in r and phi within the required constraints for a reasonable
assumption of the mismodeling in some satellite's and Earth's parameters and/or
by using dense satellites with small area-to-mass ratio. However, the error in
the Earth's GM is by far the largest source of uncertainty in the azimuthal
location which is affected at a level of 1.2 milliarcseconds per revolution.

of the form $\nu_e(\nu_{\mu}+\nu_{\tau})$ corresponding to two degenerate
neutrinos $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}+\nu_{\tau}$, and one massless neutrino
$\nu_{\mu}-\nu_{\tau}$. Atmospheric neutrino oscillations are accounted for if
the degenerate mass term is about $5\times 10^{-2}$ eV. Solar neutrino
oscillations of the Large Mixing Angle MSW type arise when small perturbations
are included leading to a mass splitting between the degenerate pair of about
$(1.7-2.0)\times 10^{-4}$ eV for the successful cases. We study the conditions
that such models must satisfy in the framework of a U(1) family symmetry broken
by vector singlets, and catalogue the simplest examples. We then perform a
renormalisation group analysis of the neutrino masses and mixing angles,
assuming the supersymmetric standard model, and find modest radiative
corrections of a few per cent, showing that the model is stable. At low
energies we find $\sin^22\theta_{23}\approx 0.93-0.96$ and
$\sin^22\theta_{12}\approx 0.9-1.0$.

calculation of the bremsstrahlung corrections is based on the full lowest-order

of virtual and real photons requires a careful matching of the arising infrared

D-branes, supergravity, superstrings, string duality, including many detailed
applications. Selected focus topics feature D-branes as probes of both
spacetime and gauge geometry, highlighting the role of world-volume curvature
