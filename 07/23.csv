of the combined data yields 68% (95%) confidence limits on the total density,
$\Omega_{\rm {tot}}\simeq 1.11 \pm 0.07 (^{+0.13}_{-0.12})$, the baryon
density, $\Omega_b h^2\simeq 0.032^{+0.005}_{-0.004} (^{+0.009}_{-0.008})$, and
the scalar spectral tilt, $n_s\simeq1.01^{+0.09}_{-0.07} (^{+0.17}_{-0.14})$.
These data are consistent with inflationary initial conditions for structure
formation. Taken together with other cosmological observations, they imply the
existence of both non-baryonic dark matter and dark energy in the universe.

  Conf. Ser",,,"MS-00-008","astro-ph",,"  We consider both observational and theoretical issues related to dynamical
mass loss from the old globular star clusters of the Galaxy. On the
observational side the evidence includes tidal tails and extratidal extensions,
kinematic effects, effects on the mass function, and influences on the
statistical properties of surviving objects. Even for isolated clusters, the
theoretical issues are not fully understood. The effects of a steady tide (i.e.
for a cluster in a circular orbit) include the imposition of a tidal boundary,
and lowering of the escape energy. Less familiar, however, are the effects of
induced mass loss. Even the definition of an ``escaper'' is not
straightforward. When mass loss is driven by relaxation, as in N-body models,
the rate of loss of mass does not scale in a simple way with the relaxation
time. Reasons for this include the very long time scales on which stars escape
even with energies above the escape threshold. For the realistic case of
unsteady tides it is still unclear under what circumstances mass loss is
dominated by relaxation or tidal heating.

the most relevant operators that can perturb the critical sliding phases.
Within our renormalization group analysis, we also find that for the case of
coupled Luttinger liquids, this effect is interleaved with the onset of the
integer quantum Hall effect for weak interactions and fields. We comment on
experimental implications for a conjectured smectic metal phase in the
cuprates.

linear or planar substrate. This effect is analyzed in a real-space
renormalization group scheme designed to capture the statistics of rare events.
In the strongly disordered regime, binding initiates at an exponentially rare
set of ``good contacts''. Renormalization of the contact potential yields a
Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition in any dimension. This and other
predictions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of a directed
polymer interacting with a columnar defect.

the difficulties associated with anisotropic homogeneous cosmologies in the
Newtonian approximation. It will be shown that, unlike in the Newtonian case,
the cosmological equations of the post-Newtonian approximation are much more in
the spirit of general relativity with regard to the nine Bianchi types and
issues of singularities. The situations of vanishing rotation and vanishing
shear are treated separately. The homogeneous Bianchi I model is considered as
an example of a rotation-free cosmology with anisotropy. It is found in the
Newtonian approximation that there are arbitrary functions that need to be
given for all time if the initial value problem is to be well-posed, while in
the post-Newtonian case there is no such need. For the general case of a
perfect fluid only the post-Newtonian theory can satisfactorily describe the
effects of pressure. This is in accordance with findings in an earlier paper
where the post-Newtonian approximation was applied to homogeneous cosmologies.
For a shear-free anisotropic homogeneous cosmology the Newtonian theory of
Heckmann and Sch\""ucking is explored. Comparisons with its relativistic and
post-Newtonian counterparts are made. In the Newtonian theory solutions exist
to which there are no analogues in general relativity. The post-Newtonian
approximation may provide a way out.

photons can generate neutrinos through pair-production of muons and pions.
Neutrinos produced at high red shift by slowly evolving sources can be
detected. Rapidly evolving sources of photons can be ruled out based on the
existing upper limit on the neutrino flux.
