(the cluster soft-excess phenomenon) challenged the notion of the hot ($\sim

reveals compelling evidence for substantial amounts of cold gas (HI) in the ICM

co-exists with gases at sub-Virial temperatures (the `warm' and `cold' phases).

as a first order system in time. From that system the generator of time
evolution is read off and a Hilbert space is given where it generates a
strongly continuous group. As a consequence the governing equation has a
well-posed initial value problem. The spectrum of the generator relevant for
stability considerations is shown to be equal to the spectrum of an operator
polynomial whose coefficients can be read off from the governing equation.
Finally, we give for the first time sufficient criteria for stability in the
form of inequalities for the coefficients of the polynomial. These show that a
negative canonical energy of the star does not necessarily indicate
instability. It is still unclear whether these criteria are strong enough to
prove stability for realistic stars.

distance indicator for the galaxies in the Local Group. We re-address the
problem of the systematic magnitude differences (DeltaM_I) between the local
clump revealed by Hipparcos, and the clump stars observed in distant galaxies.
First, we present tables and equations with the theoretically-predicted clump
M_I as a function of age and metallicity, that allow the computation of
DeltaM_I for any given galaxy model. We then explain in some detail what
determines the distribution of masses, ages, and metallicities of clump stars
in a galaxy. We point out that in galaxies with recent/ongoing star formation,
the age distribution of clump stars is strongly biased toward younger (1-3 Gyr)
ages, and hence toward higher metallicities. Obviously, this does not happen in
galaxies with predominantly old stellar populations. We construct a model for
the local clump that is shown to produce distributions of metallicities,
colours, and magnitudes, similar to those derived from spectroscopic and
Hipparcos data. Bulge, Magellanic Clouds, and Carina dSph models are used to
analyse the values of DeltaM_I for these systems. We show how the clump-RR
Lyrae data is well reproduced by the models. However, despite this, the models
indicate that the linear DeltaM_I vs. [Fe/H] relations that have been derived
from the data are not general. Finally, we provide revised clump distances to
the Bulge, Magellanic Clouds, and Carina dSph. The largest DeltaM_I values are
found for the Magellanic Clouds and Carina dSph, which turn out to be located
at distance moduli 0.2-0.3 mag longer than indicated by works which ignore
population effects. The Galactic Bulge, instead, may be slightly closer (0.1

Others have steeper outer density profiles, show sharp breaks in their density

this is driven primarily by an increase in substructure as one moves to higher

Starting from Sigmund's theory of sputter erosion, we calculate the
coefficients appearing in the continuum equation in terms of the physical
parameters characterizing the sputtering process. We analyze the morphological
features predicted by the continuum theory, comparing them with the
experimentally reported morphologies. We show that for short time scales, where
the effect of nonlinear terms is negligible, the continuum theory predicts
ripple formation. We demonstrate that in addition to relaxation by thermal
surface diffusion, the sputtering process can also contribute to the smoothing
mechanisms shaping the surface morphology. We explicitly calculate an effective
surface diffusion constant characterizing this smoothing effect, and show that
it is responsible for the low temperature ripple formation observed in various
experiments. At long time scales the nonlinear terms dominate the evolution of
the surface morphology. The nonlinear terms lead to the stabilization of the
ripple wavelength and we show that, depending on the experimental parameters
such as angle of incidence and ion energy, different morphologies can be
observed: asymptotically, sputter eroded surfaces could undergo kinetic
roughening, or can display novel ordered structures with rotated ripples.
Finally, we discuss in detail the existing experimental support for the
proposed theory, and uncover novel features of the surface morphology and
evolution, that could be directly tested experimentally.

the phase diagram exhibits two critical points and two concomitant coexistence

containing a region with closed time-like curves (time-machine spacetime) is
considered with the help of the path-integral technique. It is argued that, in
certain conditions, a sort of superselection may exist for evolution of a
particle in such a spacetime. All types of evolution are classified by the
number $n$ defined as the number of times the particle returns back to its
past. It corresponds also to the topological class of trajectories of the
particle. The evolutions corresponding to different values of $n$ are
non-coherent. The amplitudes corresponding to such evolutions may not be
superposed. Instead of one evolution operator, as in the conventional
(coherent) description, evolution of the particle is described by a family
$U_n$ of partial evolution operators. This is done in analogy with the
formalism of quantum theory of measurements, but with essential new features in
the dischronal region (the region with closed time-like curves) of the
time-machine spacetime. Partial evolution operators $U_n$ are equal to
integrals over the topological classes of paths if the evolution begins and
ends in the chronal regions. If the evolution begins or/and ends in the
dischronal region, the integral over the topological class should be multiplied
by a certain projector to give the partial evolution operator $U_n$. Thus
defined partial evolution operators possess the property of generalized
unitarity and multiplicativity. The part of evolution containing repeated
returning backward in time cannot be factorized: all backward passages of the
particle have to be considered as a single act, that cannot be presented as
gradually, step by step, passing through `causal loops'.

non-commutative geometry.

Clifford algebras of an arbitrary bilinear form-- are closely related to
deformed structures as q-spin groups, Hecke algebras, q-Young operators and
deformed tensor products. The natural question of relating Manin's approach to
quantum Clifford algebras is addressed here. Some peculiarities are outlined

circle action we have the following applications: (i) many compact manifolds,
for example $CP^{n}$, $K3$ surfaces, $S^{2n}\times P_g$ ($n\geq2$) where $P_g$
is the closed surface of genus $g\geq2$ can never be the domain of a
non-constant harmonic morphism with one-dimensional fibres whatever metrics we
put on them; (ii) let $(M^4,g)$ be a compact orientable four-manifold and
$\phi:(M^4,g)\to(N^3,h)$ a non-constant harmonic morphism. Suppose that one of
the following assertions holds: (1) $(M^4,g)$ is half-conformally flat and its
scalar curvature is zero, (2) $(M^4,g)$ is Einstein and half-conformally flat,
(3) $(M^4,g,J)$ is Hermitian-Einstein. Then, up to homotheties and Riemannian
coverings, $\phi$ is the canonical projection $T^4\to T^3$ between flat tori.

nucleus with spatial asymmetric interaction. The particle's dynamics with the
nucleus driven by a periodic excitation is considered. It is shown that
unidirectional self-propulsed particle motion arises in the absence of spatial
and temporary asymmetry of external potentials and influences. Transport modes
are the general case of complex particle dynamics in the presence of nonlinear
friction or periodic external potential. The changes of average transport
velocity and direction of transport are determined by qualitative changes of
internal dynamics regimes: local attractor bifurcations in the internal phase
space of the complex particle. Finally, microbiological relevance of the
proposed model is briefly discussed.

an important issue for controlling chaos. We point out that if the region $H$

from the inverse of the naturally invariant measure contained within that

$\tau(H)/\mu_N(H)^{-1}$ to the expanding eigenvalue of the short periodic orbit

different targets at very low energies. After subtracting Coulomb effects, we
observe that the ratio between the antineutron proton and antiproton proton
annihilation cross sections is an oscillating function of the energy at momenta
smaller 300 MeV/c. This nontrivial behavior is confirmed by the analysis of the
relative number of antiproton-neutron and antiproton-proton annihilations in
nuclei. We show that a part of the strong shadowing phenomena in
antiproton-nucleus annihilations can be explained in terms of this oscillation,
while a part requires different explainations.

approximate correlation may exist and the correlated directions are connected
with each other by the parallel transport along the world lines of the

non-locality is founded in local processes.
