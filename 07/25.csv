ionizing helium and increasing the IGM temperature. Absorption within the

magnetic field lines connecting plasma particles inside the ergosphere with
remote loads, the frame dragging twists the field lines so that energy and
angular momentum are extracted from the plasma particles. If the magnetic field
is strong enough, the energy extracted from the particles can be so large that
the particles have negative energy as they fall into the black hole. So
effectively the energy is extracted from the black hole.
  The particles inside the ergosphere can be continuously replenished with
accretion from a disk surrounding the black hole, so a transition region with
sufficient amount of plasma is formed between the black hole's horizon and the
inner edge of the disk. Thus the energy can be continuously extracted from the
black hole through the transition region. This may be the most efficient way
for extracting energy from a Kerr black hole: in principle almost all of the
rotational energy (up to $\approx 29%$ of the total energy of the black hole)
can be extracted.

  dominant galaxy",,"10.1086/321437",,"astro-ph",,"  Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in the cores
of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model
predicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups and
clusters. One possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter
has strong interactions (SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A
generalized form of the Navarro, Frenk and White profile (Zhao profile) may be
used to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing
statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple imaging is a
very sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for
SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies. Less concentrated profiles, which
result from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewer
lensed pairs. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM. More
realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, however
larger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the very
existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. The inclusion of centrally
dominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging.
However our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple
imaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate
for different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be
important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the
optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members
of a cluster population.

Sridhar and Touma (1999) proved that the presence of the BH enforces some
regularity in the dynamics within the radius of influence of the BH. We employ
their averaging method to reduce the degrees of freedom from three to two.
Numerical orbit integrations, together with Poincar\'e surfaces of section
allow us to draw a global portrait of the orbital structure; in our
calculations we employ a model cluster potential that is triaxial and harmonic.
The averaged dynamics of the axisymmetric case is integrable, and we present a
detailed comparison of orbits in oblate and prolate axisymmetric potentials.
Both cases support resonant orbits with fixed values of eccentricity,
inclination, and periapse, whose lines of nodes rotates steadily. We then
systematically explore significantly triaxial potentials, possessing small
oblateness, or prolateness. Resonant orbits and their families are studied both
numerically, and through secular perturbation theory. Chaos appears to be
suppressed for all the cases we studied, and we obtain effective third
integrals. Some of the orbits appear to reinforce the shape of the potential;
we provide phase space, as well as real space portraits of these orbits. A
particularly promising resonant orbit exists in highly prolate, triaxial
potentials.

emission blue-ward of the rest energy is difficult produce in other geometries.
In one source an apparent (and perhaps variable) absorption feature in the red

Sample analysis has defined the mean properties, showing a strong concentration
of the emission in the central regions and face-on accretion disks, at least in
Seyfert 1 galaxies. Surprising results have been obtained from examination of
the line variability. Strong profile changes may be accounted for by changes in
the illumination pattern of the central, relativistic part of the disk. In at

this paper we examine the prospects for constraining or discovering
isocurvature modes using forthcoming MAP and PLANCK measurements of the cosmic

estimates of the cosmological parameters resulting from the inclusion of these

degradation is drastic. When isocurvature modes are admitted, uncertainties in
the amplitudes of the mode auto-- and cross--correlations, and in the
cosmological parameters, become of order one. With the inclusion of
polarisation (at an optimistic sensitivity) the situation improves for the
cosmological parameters but the isocurvature modes are still only weakly
constrained. Measurements with PLANCK's estimated errors are far more
constraining, especially so with the inclusion of polarisation. If PLANCK
operates as planned the amplitudes of isocurvature modes will be constrained to
less than ten per cent of the adiabatic mode and simultaneously key
cosmological parameters will be estimated to a few per cent or better.

between M_bh and sigma with slope and scatter comparable to the observed
relation. In the model, the M_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter than
the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlation
between bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. There are two reasons for
this: i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersion

for three distinct and significant features: (1) a central bulge source, (2)
emission in the Galactic plane, and (3) an enhancement of emission at positive
latitudes above the Galactic Center. In this paper, we explore the possibility
that Sgr A East, a very prominent radio structure surrounding the Galactic
nucleus, may be a significant contributer to the central bulge feature. The
motivation for doing so stems from a recently proposed link between this radio
object and the EGRET gamma-ray source 2EG J1746-2852. If this association is
correct, then Sgr A East is also expected to be a source of copious positron
production. The results presented here show that indeed Sgr A East must have
produced a numerically significant population of positrons, but also that most
of them have not yet had sufficient time to thermalize and annihilate. As such,
Sgr A East by itself does not appear to be the dominant current source of
annihilation radiation, but it will be when the positrons have cooled
sufficiently and they have become thermalized. This raises the interesting
possibility that the bulge component may be due to the relics of earlier
explosive events like the one that produced Sgr A East.

High-Resolution Imager hints at the presence of a pulsar-powered component, and
gives this SNR a composite X-ray morphology. Combined ROSAT and ASCA imaging
show that the remnant is highly asymmetric, with its hard X-ray emission
peaking at the western lobe. The spectrum of 3C 397 is heavily absorbed, and
dominated by thermal emission with emission lines evident from Mg, Si, S, Ar
and Fe. Single-component models fail to describe the spectrum, and at least two
components are required. We use a set of non-equilibrium ionization (NEI)
models (Borkowski et al. in preparation). The temperatures from the soft and
hard components are 0.2 keV and 1.6 keV respectively. The corresponding
ionization time-scales $n_0 t$ ($n_0$ being the pre-shock hydrogen density) are
6 $\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ s and 6 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s,
respectively. The spectrum obtained with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA)
of RXTE is contaminated by emission from the Galactic ridge, with only $\sim$
15% of the count rate originating from 3C 397 in the 5-15 keV range. The PCA
spectrum allowed us to confirm the thermal nature of the hard X-ray emission. A
third component originating from a pulsar-driven component is possible, but the
contamination of the source signal by the Galactic ridge did not allow us to
find pulsations from any hidden pulsar. We discuss the X-ray spectrum in the
light of two scenarios: a young ejecta-dominated remnant of a core-collapse SN,
and a middle-aged SNR expanding in a dense ISM. Spatially resolved spectroscopy
(with CHANDRA and XMM) is needed to differentiate between the two scenarios,
and address the nature of the mysterious radio-quiet X-ray hot spot.

(10(4) cm(-3)) in order to explain the brightest region of the nebula. The
dynamical timescale is about a year and the recombination timescale of the same
order. Bright patches are observed to fade in these times. The energy required
to ionize the nebula is the bolometric luminosity of the nova for 30 days,
smaller than the time during which the temperature of the nova photosphere was

alternative approach to QFT for combining the quantum mechanics and special

some representation of Lorentz group) through the whole theory. Scalar product
has been redefined to take into the account the nonunitarity of representations
of Lorentz group. Understanding parity symmetry turns out to be the key
ingredient throughout the process. Instead of trying to guess an equation or a
set of equations for some wave functions or fields (or equivalently trying to
guess a Lagrangian for the same), one derives them based only on the
superposition principle and properties of wave functions under Lorentz
transformations and parity. The resulting model has striking similarities with
the standard quantum field theory and yet has no negative energy states, no
zitterbewegung effects, symmetric energy momentum tensor and angular momentum
density tensor for \emph{all} representations of Lorentz group (unifying the
theoretical description of all particles), as well as clear physical
interpretation. It also offers a possible interpretation why particles and
antiparticles have opposite quantum numbers.

discusses the computation of Witten's index for 4-dimensional gauge theories,

resolved by the discovery that for orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups,
periodic flat connections exist that are contained in seperate, disconnected
components of the moduli space. Chapter 3 and 4 discuss some aspects of the
construction of holonomies parametrising vacua on such disconnected components.
Chapter 5 demonstrates a construction of vacua and holonomies for gauge
theories with classical groups, with non-periodic (twisted) boundary
conditions, using an orientifold description. The new solutions with
exceptional and orthogonal gauge groups also occur in string theory. Chapter 6,
containing previously unpublished material, shows that they can be realised
within heterotic string theories as asymmetric orbifolds. The presence of
string winding states modifies the analysis for the gauge theory in a crucial
way, eliminating many possibilities. The remaining ones are related by string

polytropic exponent, invariant. This implies that the kinematical invariance
group of the Euler equations is larger than the Galilei group. In this paper we

$F(\ka)=\ka^{2}$ the constant potential fails to minimize the principal
eigenvalue for $\alpha>\alpha_{c}=\mu_{1}/(4\ka_{0}^{2})$, where $\mu_{1}$ is
the first nonzero eigenvalue of $-\Delta$. This complements a result by Exner,
Harrell and Loss (math-ph/9901022), showing that the critical value where the
circle stops being a minimizer for a class of Schr\""{o}dinger operators
penalized by curvature is given by $\alpha_{c}$. Furthermore, we show that the

applications of mathematics. Until recently, it has been hopeless to find
explicit solutions to such systems, and mathematics has instead developed deep
and powerful theories about the solutions to polynomial equations. Enumerative
Geometry is concerned with counting the number of solutions when the
polynomials come from a geometric situation and Intersection Theory gives
methods to accomplish the enumeration.
  We use Macaulay 2 to investigate some problems from enumerative geometry,
illustrating some applications of symbolic computation to this important
problem of solving systems of polynomial equations. Besides enumerating
solutions to the resulting polynomial systems, which include overdetermined,
deficient, and improper systems, we address the important question of real
solutions to these geometric problems.
  The text contains evaluated Macaulay 2 code to illuminate the discussion.

  expended",,,,"math.QA",,"  One of the most fundamental problems in the theory of finite- dimensional
Hopf algebras is their classification over an algebraically closed field k of
characteristic 0. This problem is extremely difficult, hence people restrict it
to certain classes of Hopf algebras, e.g. to semisimple ones. Semisimple Hopf
algebras deserve to be considered as ""quantum"" analogue of finite groups, but
even so, the problem remains extremely hard (even in low dimensions) and very
little is known. A great boost to the theory of Hopf algebras was given by
Drinfeld who invented the fundamental class of (quasi)triangular Hopf algebras
(A,R). Thus, it is natural to first try to classify semisimple triangular Hopf
algebras (A,R) over k (i.e. R is unitary). The theory of such Hopf algebras is
now essentially closed by a sequence of works by P. Etingof and the author. The
key theorem in this theory states that A is obtained from a group algebra of a
unique (up to isomorphism) finite group by twisting its usual comultiplication.
The proof of this theorem relies on Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories
in an essentail way. The purpose of this paper is to explain the proof in full
details. In particular, to discuss all the necessary background from category
theory (e.g. symmetric, rigid, and Tannakian categories), and the properties of
the category of representations of triangular (semisimple) Hopf algebras.

situation to the introductory physics textbook example of diffraction of a

and the standing light wave the role of the material grating, highlighting
particle - wave duality. Apart from representing such a beautiful example of
particle - wave duality, the diffracted particle beams are coherent. This
allows the construction of matter interferometers and explains why the Kapitza
- Dirac effect is one of the workhorses in the field of atom optics. Atom
optics concerns the manipulation of atomic waves in ways analogous to the
manipulation of light waves with optical elements. The excitement and activity
in this new field of physics stems for a part from the realisation that the
shorter de Broglie wavelengths of matter waves allow ultimate sensitivities for
diffractive and interferometric experiments that in principle would far exceed
their optical analogues. Not only is the Kapitza - Dirac effect an important
enabling tool for this field of physics, but diffraction peaks have never been
observed for electrons, for which is was originally proposed in 1933. Why has
this not been observed? What is the relation between the interaction of laser
light with electrons and the interaction of laser light with atoms, or in other
words what is the relation between the ponderomotive potential and the
