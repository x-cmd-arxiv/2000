the beginning of the precision era of Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy
(CMB) measurements. We investigate the observational constraints from the
current CMB anisotropy measurements on the simplest inflation models,
characterized by a single scalar field $\phi$, in the parameter space
consisting of scalar spectral index $n_S$ and tensor/scalar ratio $r$. If we
include constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN),
we show that the favored inflationary models have negligible tensor amplitude
and a ``red'' tilt, with a best fit of $n_S \simeq 0.93$, which is consistent
with the simplest ``small-field'' inflation models, but rules out large-field
models at the $1\sigma$ level. Without including BBN constraints, a broader
range of models are consistent with the data. The best fit (assuming negligible
reionization) is a scale-invariant spectrum, $n_S \simeq 1$, which includes
large-field and hybrid scenarios. Large-field models (such as chaotic and
power-law inflation) with tilt $n_S < 0.9$ are strongly disfavored in all
cases.

New point-like X-ray sources have also been discovered. The results on the

a two-temperature thermal spectrum (kT1~0.6keV and kT2~8keV) and an
energy-dependent morphology, with the hard emission (5-10 keV) elongated along
the galactic plane and the soft one (2-5 keV) spatially correlated with the
radio halo of SgrAEast. The results of the study of the diffuse X-ray emission
from other three fields in the Galactic Center Region containing the giant
molecular clouds SgrB2, SgrC and SgrD are reported for the first time. The
diffuse emission from the direction of these three molecular clouds shows a
double temperature nature as well, with a prominent iron line at \~6.7keV, the
intensity and equivalent width of which depends on the galactic longitude.
Moreover, the SgrB2 spectrum shows an intense 6.4keV line of fluorescent
origin. While the hard component of the Galactic Center diffuse emission
displays a similar temperature with respect to the Galactic Ridge, the low
temperature plasma is significantly softer. This may be due to a net
contribution produced from the accretion of material onto old isolated neutron
stars located inside the giant molecular clouds.

quiescent molecular cloud in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) was observed
using ISOCAM. The spectrum is dominated by broad emission bands at 6.2, 7.7,
and 11.3 microns, with weaker bands at 8.6 and 12.7 microns. As these are the
same bands, with similar shape and relative strengths, as observed in the ISM
of our Galaxy, the same carriers must exist in both galaxies. The carriers are
widely consider to be large molecules or clusters of aromatic hydrocarbons,
which absorb ultraviolet and visible photons and emit mid-infrared photons
during high-temperature pulses. Based on the brightness of the mid-infrared
emission and the estimated strength of the radiation field in the SMC, the
absorption by aromatic hydrocarbons is of order 10% of total dust absorption,
comparable to the case for Galactic dust. Ultraviolet observations of
extinction of most SMC stars have shown that dust in the SMC does not absorb in
the 2175 Angstrom feature that is so prominent in Milky Way extinction. If
aromatic hydrocarbons and featureless extinction curves were ubiquitous in the
SMC, then we would conclude that aromatic hydrocarbons are not the carriers of
the 2175 Angstrom feature. However, SMC extinction curve measurements are
biased toward hot, luminous stars, where aromatic hydrocarbons are destroyed,
so that the absence of the 2175 Angstrom bump may not be typical of SMC dust.
The presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in the SMC further demonstrate that these
molecules exist even in an interstellar medium with an order-of-magnitude lower
metallicity than in the disk of the Milky Way.

the intrinsic absorption scenario for explaining soft X-ray weakness; both PG

cm^-2) of absorbing gas. Interestingly, PG 1011-040 shows no spectral evidence
for X-ray absorption. The weak X-ray emission may result from very strong
absorption of a partially covered source, or this AGN may be intrinsically
X-ray weak. PG 2112+059 is a Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSO, and we find it to
have the highest X-ray flux known of this class. It shows a typical power-law
X-ray continuum above 3 keV; this is the first direct evidence that BAL QSOs
indeed have normal X-ray continua underlying their intrinsic absorption.
Finally, marked variability between the ROSAT and ASCA observations of PG
1535+547 and PG 2112+059 suggests that the soft X-ray weak designation may be
transient, and multi-epoch 0.1-10.0 keV X-ray observations are required to
constrain variability of the absorber and continuum.

spherical symmetry. In this paper the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium is
calculated numerically in the radial direction for either for small deviations
from different assumptions for the poloidal current distribution. We generally
find indication that the scale height of the magnetic white dwarf atmosphere
enlarges with magnetic field strength and/or poloidal current strength. This is
in qualitative agreement with recent spectropolarimetric observations of
Grw$+10\degr8247$. Quantitatively, we find for e.g. a mean surface poloidal
field strength of 100 MG and a toroidal field strength of 2-10 MG an increase
of scale height by a factor of 10. This is indicating that already a small
deviation from the initial force-free dipolar magnetic field may lead to
observable effects. We further propose the method of finite elements for the
solution of the two-dimensional magnetohydrostatic equilibrium including
radiation transport in the diffusive approximation. We present and discuss
preliminary solutions, again indicating on an expansion of the magnetized

  appear in Mem. Soc. Astron. It",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (abridged) Observations clearly show that low-mass AGB stars can provide a
nucleosynthesis site of the s-process. Recent stellar evolution models indicate
that radiative burning of C13 between thermal pulses in low-mass AGB stars may
indeed provide the needed neutrons. Some mixing between the proton-rich
envelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of C13. However,
the responsible physical mechanism is not yet unambiguously identified. We
present stellar model calculations with overshoot and rotation. Overshoot, with
a time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partial
mixture of protons and C12 during the third dredge-up. According to the
depth-dependent ratio of protons and C12, a small C13-pocket forms underneath a
N14-rich layer. Overshoot does not allow for any mixing during the interpulse
phase. Rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradients
which form at the envelope-core interface in AGB stars, in particular after a
thermal pulse. This leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case of
overshoot. However, rotation continues to mix the region of the C13-pocket with
a diffusion coefficient of log D ~ 2...3 [cm**2 / s]. This does not only spread
the C13-pocket, but also the more massive N14-rich layer, and finally leads to
mixture of both layers. By the time when the temperature there has risen to
about 9*10E7K and neutron production sets in, the N14 abundance exceeds the C13
abundance by a factor of 5...10. We analyze the role of N14 as a neutron poison
by considering the recycling of neutrons via N14(n,p)C14 and
C12(p,gamma)N13(beta+)C13 qualitatively. We find that as long as X(N14) <<
X(C12), the s-process will still be possible to occur under radiative
conditions.

is likely to be representative of Seyfert 1 galaxies as a class. A recent 100
ks BeppoSAX observation (Perola et al. 1999) clearly confirmed the presence of
a warm absorber, a reflection component (R~0.6), and a high-energy cut-off in
the power law at Ec~270 keV. Its richness in spectral features, combined with
its large flux (~1.6 x 10**-10 erg/cm2s between 2-10 keV), make this target
ideal for multiple observations (in particular with BeppoSAX) to search for
spectral variations. Results obtained from 3 follow-up observations (40 ks
each) are presented here. The first and most important goal of this study was
to probe the origin of the Compton reflection component observed in Seyfert
galaxies by monitoring the variability of the reflection continuum and FeK line
in response to primary continuum variations. The second goal was to search for
variability in the high energy cutoff. We obtain however no conclusive results
on any of these issues. In fact, all four observations unfortunately caught the
source at almost the same flux, showing only little, and marginal, spectral
changes between different observations.

  Main Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present deep V and I photometry of stellar field in four previously
unstudied low latitude regions of the Galactic disk. All observed fields are
located at the western side of the Galactic Center in the direction of the
Coalsack-Carina region. Two of them are suspected to cross the inner spiral
arm. More than $10^5$ stars are detected in total, down to a magnitude of V
$\sim 23.5$.
  Due to the low galactic latitude of the studied fields, the scale length and
mainly the scale height of the thick disk are not strongly constrained by the
observations. However a thin disk scale height of about
  250$\pm 60$ pc seems to be favored. The data are very sensitive to the star
formation rate of the thin disk. A decreasing star formation rate (SFR) is
necessary to reproduce the distribution of the stars in the colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) as well as the luminosity functions. A constant or a strongly
increasing SFR as derived using Hipparcos data for the solar neighborhood
(Bertelli et al 1999) are marginally in agreement with the luminosity functions
but they are at odds with the CMDs. The analysis of these data suggest that the
solar neighborhood SFR cannot be considered as representative for the whole
thin disk. From the star-counts the local neighborhood mass density in stars
more massive than 0.1 M$_\odot$ is found to be 0.036--0.02 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$.
Finally, the location of inner spiral arm is discussed. We find evidence of a
population younger than 10$^8$ yr distributed in a spiral arm at a distance of
1.3$\pm 0.2$ and 1.5 $\pm 0.2$\,Kpc in the directions l$\sim$\,292 and
l$\sim$\,305 respectively. This result is consistent with the spiral arm

these objects our detections are at the level of ~ 0.3-1% local fractional
circular polarization. Our observations are consistent across multiple epochs
(and different calibration techniques) in the sign and magnitude of the
circular polarization observed. 3C273 and 3C279 both undergo core outbursts
during our observations and changes in the circular polarization of both
sources are correlated with these outbursts. In general, we observe the
circular polarization to be nearly coincident with the strong VLBI cores of
these objects; however, in 3C84 the circular polarization is located a full
milli-arcsecond south of the source peak, and in the 1996.73 epoch of 3C273 the
circular polarization is predominately associated with the newly emerging jet
component. Circular polarization may be produced as an intrinsic component of
synchrotron radiation or by the Faraday conversion of linear to circular
polarization. Our single frequency observations do not easily distinguish
between these possible mechanisms, but independent of mechanism, the remarkable
consistency across epoch of the sign of the observed circular polarization
suggests the existence of a long term, stable, uni-directional magnetic field.
Single dish observations of 3C273 and 3C279 at 8 GHz by Hodge and Aller suggest
that this stability may persist for decades in our frame of observation.

an attractive fixed point identified with falling. The scaling of the

We propose these kind of excitations in alternative to kinks and breathers. The

up to now it has been used to study on the one hand low amplitude breather

model to include the case of heterogeneous chains, in order to get closer to a
description of real DNA; in fact, the Morse potential representing the
interaction between complementary bases has two possible depths, one for A-T
and one for G-C base pairs. We first compute the equilibrium configurations of
a chain with a degree of uncoiling, and we find that a static bubble is among
them; then we show, by molecular dynamics simulations, that these bubbles, once
generated, can move along the chain. We find that also in the most unfavourable

form of Einstein's General Relativity equivalence principle, the gravitational
and inertial masses are equivalent. However recent calculations (gr-qc/9910036)
have revealed that they are correlated by an adimensional factor, which depends
on the incident radiation upon the particle. It was shown that there is a
direct correlation between the radiation absorbed by the particle and its
gravitational mass, independently of the inertial mass. This finding has
fundamental consequences to Unified Field Theory and Quantum Cosmology. It was
also shown that only in the absence of electromagnetic radiation this factor
becomes equal to one and that, in specific electromagnetic conditions, it can
be reduced, nullified or made negative. This means that there is the
possibility of control of the gravitational mass by means of the incident
radiation. This unexpected theoretical result was recently confirmed by an
experiment (gr-qc/0005107). Consequently there is a strong evidence that the
gravitational forces can be reduced, nullified and inverted by means of
electromagnetic radiation. This means that, in practice we can produce
gravitational binaries, and in this way to extract energy from a gravitational
field. Here we describe a process by which energy can be extracted directly

the small induced effects of chiral symmetry breaking inherent in this
formulation can be described by a residual mass ($\mres$) whose size decreases
as the separation between the domain walls ($L_s$) is increased. However, at
stronger couplings much larger values of $L_s$ are required to achieve a given
physical value of $\mres$. For $\beta=6.0$ and $L_s=16$, we find
$\mres/m_s=0.033(3)$, while for $\beta=5.7$, and $L_s=48$,
$\mres/m_s=0.074(5)$, where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass. These values are
significantly smaller than those obtained from a more naive determination in
our earlier studies. Important effects of topological near zero modes which
should afflict an accurate quenched calculation are easily visible in both the
chiral condensate and the pion propagator. These effects can be controlled by
working at an appropriately large volume. A non-linear behavior of $m_\pi^2$ in
the limit of small quark mass suggests the presence of additional infrared
subtlety in the quenched approximation. Good scaling is seen both in masses and
in $f_\pi$ over our entire range, with inverse lattice spacing varying between
1 and 2 GeV.

which explain the small value of the cosmological constant using the anthropic
principle. We argue that simultaneous solution of the gauge hierarchy problem
is a strong constraint on any such theory. We exhibit three classes of models
which satisfy these constraints. The first is a version of the BP model with
precisely two large dimensions. The second involves 6-branes and antibranes
wrapped on supersymmetric 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and the third is a
version of the irrational axion model. All of them have possible problems in
explaining the size of microwave background fluctuations. We also find that
most models of this type predict that all constants in the low energy
Lagrangian, as well as the gauge groups and representation content, are chosen
from an ensemble and cannot be uniquely determined from the fundamental theory.
In our opinion, this significantly reduces the appeal of this kind of solution
of the cosmological constant problem. On the other hand, we argue that the
vacuum selection problem of string theory might plausibly have an anthropic,
cosmological solution.

together with a single pure exponential scalar potential in supergravity. These
scalar potentials arise from a sphere reduction in M-theory or string theory.
There are several examples of flat (BPS) domain walls that lead to a
localisation of gravity on the brane, and for these we obtain the form of the
corrections to Newtonian gravity. These solutions are lifted back on certain
internal spheres to D=11 and D=10 as M-branes and D-branes. We find that the
domain walls that can trap gravity yield M-branes or Dp-branes that have a
natural decoupling limit, i.e. p\le 5, with the delta-function source providing
an ultra-violet cut-off in a dual quantum field theory. This suggests that the
localisation of gravity can generally be realised within a Domain-wall/QFT
correspondence, with the delta-function domain-wall source providing a cut-off
from the space-time boundary for these domain-wall solutions. We also discuss
the form of the one-loop corrections to the graviton propagator from the

on the spacetime boundary. N=1 Poincare supergravity can be induced by
explicitly breaking the conformal invariance via a radial cutoff in the 5d
space. The AdS/CFT correspondence relates the maximal gauged supergravity in
five dimensions to N=4 super Yang-Mills on the 4d spacetime boundary. In this
context we show that the conformal anomaly of the gauge theory induces
conformal gravity on the boundary of the space and that this theory, via the
renormalization group, encapsulates the gravitational dynamics of the skin of
asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results have several applications to the
AdS/CFT correspondence and the Randall-Sundrum scenario.

  posting; fixes an error concerning unitarity",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The symmetry of the problem of the apparent deficit in upward-going
atmospheric muon neutrinos reveals two possible, nonexclusive kinds of
solution: Nonlinearity in distance or nonlinearity in angle of observation.
  Nonlinearity in distance leads to the most popular theory for the atmospheric
problem, neutrino flavor oscillations. If the observed deficit is caused by
oscillations and not, say, flavor-changing or other weak-force scattering,
neutrinos must be massive. But, if flavor oscillations occur in vacuum, all
oscillating neutrinos must have exactly equal mass. Theories of oscillation in
matter such as the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect do not work in
vacuum. This is the conceptual conflict of kinematics versus vacuum
oscillations. Flavor-changing oscillations like those of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark theory become possible in vacuum if
freely propagating neutrinos may be associated with local substructure.
  Nonlinearity in angle of observation leads to a simple prediction of an
excess of horizontal muon flavor. This and other angle-based effects should be

optical devices which have a Jones matrix representation, according to the
types of eigenvectors they possess, is given a new visit through the
Group-theoretical connection of polarization elements. The diattenuators and
retarders are recognized as the elements corresponding to boosts and rotations
respectively. The structure of homogeneous elements other than diattenuators
and retarders are identified by giving the quaternion corresponding to these
elements. The set of degenerate polarization elements is identified with the so
called `null' elements of the Lorentz Group. Singular polarization elements are
examined in their more illustrative Mueller matrix representation and finally
the eigenstructure of a special class of singular Mueller matrices is studied.

cavities feature a high efficiency, a compact design and a big variety of
possible fields of application. They find use both as bunchers and post
accelerators to vary the final energy of the beam. In comparison to other
available designs, the advantage of these structures lies in their small size.
Furthermore they can easily be tuned to the required resonance frequency by
varying the length of the spiral. Due to the small size of the cavities the
required budget can also be kept low. Here, two slightly different types of
spiral loaded cavities, which were built for the REX-ISOLDE project at CERN and
the intensity upgrade program at GSI are being discussed.

important to measure the temporal shape of the emitted current. With a duration
of the laser pulse of 25 ps, the required resolution is a few ps. An apparatus
has been set up for the purpose, consisting of a 30 kV electron gun, a
microwave deflecting cavity which translates the temporal distribution of the
electron bunch into a spatial one, a fluorescent screen on which the deflected
beam traces a sector of a circle and various focusing and charge measuring
items. The image on the screen is detected via a CCD camera and a frame
grabber. We describe the performance of the apparatus and some preliminary
temporal distribution measurements.

Theor. Phys. 37 (1998) 273-280",,,"quant-ph",,"  A continuously measured quantum system may be described by restricted path
integrals (RPI) or equivalently by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The measured
system is then considered as an open system, the influence of the environment
being taken into account by restricting the path integral or by inclusion of an
imaginary part in the Hamiltonian. This way of description of measurements
naturally follows from the Feynman form of quantum mechanics without any
additional postulates and may be interpreted as an information approach to
continuous quantum measurements. This reveals deep features of quantum physics
concerning relations between quantum world and its classical appearance.

process provided the initial state is restricted by some conditions. The
application of such processes for preventing decoherence, for example in
quantum computers, was suggested. We shall show that in the situation when the
quantum jump is reversible it supplies no information about the initial state
additional to the information known beforehand. Therefore the reversibility of
this type does not contradict the general statement of quantum measurement
theory: a measurement cannot be reversed. As a consequence of this, the
coherence of a state (say, in a quantum computer) cannot be restored after it
is destroyed by dissipative processes having a character of measurement.

  for Creation of Nanostructures","16 pages, 7 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We have shown via explicit analysis as well as numerical simulation the
design of two large angle interferometers employing two-photon pulses. The
first one uses the technique of adiabatic following in a dark state to produce
a large splitting angle atomic interferometer that is capable of producing one
dimensional gratings with spacings as small as 2 nm. Unlike other large angle
interferometers, this technique is not sensitive to errors in optical pulse
area and decoherence from excited state decay. This may lead to a nearly two
orders of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of devices such as atomic
gyroscopes, which are already as good as the best laser gyroscopes. The second
interferometer uses the technique of Raman pulses to produce a two-dimensional
interferometer, with independent choice of grating spacings in each direction,
each being as small as 2 nm. This scheme may enable one to produce uniform
arrays of quantum dots with dimensions of only a few nm on each side. In
addition, it may be possible to generalize this process to produce arbitrary
patterns with the same type of resolution.
