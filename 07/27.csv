  Astrophysics Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The uniqueness and stability of irradiated flaring passive protostellar disks
is investigated in the context of a simplified set of equations for the
vertical height H as a function of radius R. It is found that the well-known
flaring disk solution with H ~ R^{9/7} is not unique. Diverging solutions and
asymptotically conical (H ~ R) solutions are also found. Moreover, using
time-dependent linear perturbation analysis, it is found that the flaring disk
solution may become unstable to self-shadowing. A local enhancement in the
vertical height alters the functional form of irradiation grazing angle, and
causes the 'sunny side' of the enhancement to grow and the 'shadow side' to
collapse in a run-away fashion. This instability operates in regions of the
disk in which the cooling time is much shorter than the vertical sound crossing
time, which may occur in the outer regions of the passive irradiated disk if
dust and gas are sufficiently strongly thermally coupled. Processes that may
stabilize the disk, which include active accretion, irradiation from above
(e.g. a scattering corona) and low disk optical depth, are likely to operate
only at small or at large radius. The simple analysis of this Letter therefore
suggests that the instability may alter the flaring disk structure at
intermediate radii (between the actively accreting and fast rotating inner
regions and the optically thin outer regions).

mass and the global velocity dispersion of stars in the host galaxy bulge

the median BH mass fraction is 0.15 % of the bulge mass. In contrast, BH mass
does not scale with disk properties. Pure disk galaxies - ones that lack a
bulge component - must have BH mass fractions that are much smaller than the BH
mass fractions in bulges. These results imply a close connection between BH
growth and bulge (but not disk) formation. Observations increasingly support
the hypothesis that the major events that form a bulge or elliptical galaxy and
the main growth phases of its BH - when it shone like a quasar - were the same

to simulated data sets we show that the EM algorithm - using the both the AIC &

density estimate of the distribution while requiring no ``fine-tuning'' of the
input algorithm parameters. We find that EM can accurately recover the
underlying density distribution from point processes thus providing an
efficient adaptive smoothing method for astronomical source catalogs. To
demonstrate the general application of this statistic to astrophysical problems
we consider two cases of density estimation; the clustering of galaxies in
redshift space and the clustering of stars in color space. From these data we
show that EM provides an adaptive smoothing of the distribution of galaxies in
redshift space (describing accurately both the small and large-scale features
within the data) and a means of identifying outliers in multi-dimensional
color-color space (e.g. for the identification of high redshift QSOs).
Automated tools such as those based on the EM algorithm will be needed in the
analysis of the next generation of astronomical catalogs (2MASS, FIRST, PLANCK,

approach we treat the residual gas as an external potential. The gas expulsion
is approximated by reducing the gas mass to zero on a given timescale, which is
treated as a free parameter. In a second set of simulations we use smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to follow the dynamics of the outflowing residual
gas self-consistently. We investigate cases where gas outflow is induced by an
outwards propagating shock front and where the whole gas cloud is heated
homogeneously, leading to ejection.
  If the stars are in virial equilibrium with the gaseous environment
initially, bound clusters only form in regions where the local SFE is larger

account only the two lowest states in DWP is known to lead to a Kondo-like
Hamiltonian with rather low Kondo temperature, $T_K$. We prove that, in
contrast to previous believes, the contribution of higher excited states in DWP
does not enhance $T_K$. On the contrary, $T_K$ is reduced by three orders of
magnitude as compared with the two-level model: the prefactor in $T_K$ is
determined by the spacing between the second and the third levels in DWP rather
than by the electron Fermi energy. Moreover, $T_K$, turns out to be
parametrically smaller than the splitting between the two lowest levels.
Therefore, there is no microscopic model of movable defects which may justify
non-Fermi liquid $2CK$ phenomenology.

  21--26. University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, 1996",,"TR-1996-29","cs.IR cs.LO",,"  The problem of Information Retrieval is, given a set of documents D and a
query q, providing an algorithm for retrieving all documents in D relevant to
q. However, retrieval should depend and be updated whenever the user is able to
provide as an input a preferred set of relevant documents; this process is
known as em relevance feedback. Recent work in IR has been paying great
attention to models which employ a logical approach; the advantage being that
one can have a simple computable characterization of retrieval on the basis of
a pure logical analysis of retrieval. Most of the logical models make use of
probabilities or similar belief functions in order to introduce the inductive
component whereby uncertainty is treated. Their general paradigm is the
following: em find the nature of conditional $d\imp q$ and then define a
probability on the top of it. We just reverse this point of view; first use the
numerical information, frequencies or probabilities, then define your own
logical consequence. More generally, we claim that retrieval is a form of
deduction. We introduce a simple but powerful logical framework of relevance
feedback, derived from the well founded area of nonmonotonic logic. This
description can help us evaluate, describe and compare from a theoretical point
of view previous approaches based on conditionals or probabilities.

techniques, gravitation should be decribed, if possible, in pure connection
formalism, as a Yang-Mills theory of a certain spacetime group, say the
Poincare or the affine group. This embodies the translational as well as the
linear connection. However, the coframe is not the standard Yang-Mills type
gauge field of the translations, since it lacks the inhomogeneous gradient term
in the gauge transformations. By explicitly restoring the ""hidden"" piece
responsible for this behavior within the framework of nonlinear realizations,
the usual geometrical interpretation of the dynamical theory becomes possible,
and in addition one can avoid the metric or coframe degeneracy which would
otherwise interfere with the integrations within the path integral. We claim
that nonlinear realizations provide a general mathematical scheme clarifying
the foundations of gauge theories of spacetime symmetries. When applied to
construct the Yang-Mills theory of the affine group, tetrads become identified
with nonlinear translational connections; the anholonomic metric does not
constitute any more an independent gravitational potential, since its degrees
of freedom reveal to correspond to eliminable Goldstone bosons. This may be an
important advantage for quantization.

of the colliding objects. In this paper, we study the qualitative aspects of
the theory and review its development in two subsequent papers. Our key result
is that the effective mass of the quark in the expanding system formed in the

time the quark mode becomes sufficiently localized. The chromo-magneto-static

  In order to prove our main result, we use the classification theory developed
by the third author (based on the ideas of Lu, Yan, and Zhu) to reduce the
problem to a group-theoretical statement: a finite group with trivial center
generated by a conjugacy class of prime order is a subgroup of the affine
group. Unfortunalely, we did not find an elementary proof of this statement,
and our proof relies on the classification of outer automorphisms of finite
simple groups.

extinction is related to the initial number $M_{o}$ of sterile individuals
released in the niche. In fact, the existence of a critical sterile-population

correlations exist, and it is safe to neglect them only if azimuthal
anisotropies are much larger than 1/sqrt(N), with N the total number of
particles emitted in the collision. This condition is not satisfied at
ultrarelativistic energies. We propose a new method, based on a cumulant
expansion of multiparticle azimuthal correlations, which allows to measure much
smaller values of azimuthal anisotropies, down to 1/N. It is simple to
implement and can be used to measure both integrated and differential flow.
Furthermore, this method automatically eliminates the major systematic errors,
which are due to azimuthal asymmetries in the detector acceptance.
