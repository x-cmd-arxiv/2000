detailed modeling of the correlated X-ray -- optical (3590 and 5510 Angstrem)

model optical light curves by convolving the observed X-ray flux with the
response function of an infinite, thin accretion disk, illuminated by a
point-like X-ray source at a given height above the compact object (the
lamp-post model) and compare their properties to those observed. Special
attention is given to the correct computation of the X-ray albedo of the disk.
We further compute the X-ray reflection response at two energies (E = 1 and 20
keV) and argue for the possibility of hard lags in their cross spectra. We also
compute the continuum Optical -- UV and the X-ray reflection spectra as well as
the Fe K-alpha fluorescent line profiles which we also compare to observations.
Despite the large (~50 percent) amplitude excursions of the X-ray flux, the
model optical light curves exhibit variability amplitudes of 3 -- 4 percent,
not unlike those observed. However, the model CCF between the X-ray and the
model optical variations show clear lags of 0.1 and 0.25 days for black hole
masses M = 10^7 and 10^8 Solar masses, respectively, not apparent in the data.
The synchrony of X-ray - optical variations points toward the BH mass < 10^7
Solar masses, whereas the X-ray spectra prefer BH mass > 10^8. Our conclusion
is that the combination of the observed optical/UV/X-ray spectral and timing
observations are inconsistent with the lamp-post model geometry for NGC 3516.

larger power-spectrum amplitude sigma_8 would give rise to a larger scatter

Gaussian initial conditions, the ST distribution suggests a constraint sigma_8
Omega_0^{0.26} \simeq 0.76. The ST relation is expected to get tighter at high
redshifts. In the process, we derive a simple formula for the halo
formation-redshift distribution for non-Gaussian models. We also suggest that
the discrepancy between the naive zero-redshift ST relation and that observed
may be due, at least in part, to the fact that lower-mass clusters form over a

scattered nuclear radiation is found in an angular region which extends over ~
70 degrees and thus it does not originate from a highly collimated beam, but is
associated with more omni-directional nuclear illumination. These observations
also show the presence of an unresolved, highly polarized (P = 11.1 %) nuclear
source whose polarization angle PA = 148.2 degrees is perpendicular to the jet
axis. We set an upper limit of 0.04'' (~0.8 pc) to its extent. The observed
nuclear polarization is naturally accounted for if we are observing scattered
light from an otherwise obscured nucleus provided that both the scattering
region and the occulting torus are extremely compact, with an outer radius of

counterpart of the radio core, similar to those found in other low luminosity
radio-galaxies observed with HST. We discuss these results in the framework of

investigate metal enrichment of the primordial gas. For this purpose, we have
constructed a parallel 3-D hydrodynamics code incorporating the radiative
cooling and self-gravity. The self-gravity and radiative cooling develop the
inhomogeneous structure of the ISM from a small perturbation with a power-law
spectrum. The resultant density ranges from 0.5 cm$^{-3}$ to 10$^6$ cm $^{-3}$.
Calculations for a supernova (SN) with the progenitor mass of 20 solar mass are
performed as the first step of a series of our study. It is found from the
results that a single SN distributes some of newly synthesized heavy elements
into a dense filament of the ISM with densities ranging from 100 to 10$^4$
cm$^{-3}$ depending on where the SN explodes. Thus, the metallicity [Mg/H] of
the dense filaments polluted by the SN ejecta becomes $-2.7\pm0.5$. From these
filaments, the first Population II stars will form. This value is in accordance
with the previous analytical work (Shigeyama & Tsujimoto 1998) with accuracy of
$\sim 0.3$ dex.

a half light radius of 13', corresponding to Rh = 6.4 pc at an assumed distance
of 1.7 kpc. The interstellar extinction for member stars ranges from Av = 5m to
20m, which led to a considerable underestimation of the association size and
richness in former optical studies. From the infrared colour-magnitude diagram,
the number of OB member stars is estimated to 2600 +/- 400, while the number of
O stars amounts to 120 +/- 20. This is the largest number of O stars ever found
in a galactic massive star association. The slope of the initial mass function
has been determined from the colour-magnitude diagram to Gamma=-1.6 +/- 0.1.
The total mass of Cyg OB2 is estimated to (4-10)*10^4 Msol, where the primary
uncertainty comes from the unknown lower mass cut-off. Using the radial density
profile of the association, the central mass density is determined to
rho0=40-150 Msol pc^-3. Considering the mass, density, and size of Cyg OB2 it
seems untenable to classify this object still as OB association. Cygnus OB2
more closely resembles a young globular cluster like those observed in the
Large Magellanic Cloud or in extragalactic star forming regions. It is
therefore suggested to re-classify Cygnus OB2 as young globular cluster - an
idea which goes back to Reddish et al. (1966). Cygnus OB2 would then be the
first object of this class in the Milky Way.

supposed D=5 as a rule. However, it would be much more realistic to consider
our four-Universe as 4-shell or 3-brane inside, e.g., 10-dimensional spacetime.
In turn it immediately means that the theory of the $(D-D_E)$-dimensional
singular embeddings, where the number of extra dimensions $D_E > 1$, is needed.
Hence, the aim of this work is to provide such a theory: we construct the
rigorous general theory of the induced gravity on singular submanifolds. At
first, we perform the decomposition of the tangent bundle into the two
subbundles which will be associated later with external and visible (with
respect to some low-dimensional observer) parts of the high-$D$ manifold. Then
we go to physics and perform the split of the manifold (in addition to the
split of the tangent bundle) to describe both the induced internal geometry and
external as-a-whole dynamics of singular embeddings, assuming matter being
confined on the singular submanifold but gravity being propagated through the
high-$D$ manifold. With the use of the de Rham axiomatic approach to
delta-distributions we demonstrate that the four-Universe can be singularly
embedded only in five- and six-dimensional space so if we want to consider its
embedding in 10D then extra dimensions must be included as a product space
only. We discuss the revealed generic features of the theory such as the
multi-normal anisotropy, restrictions on an ambient space, reformulation of the
conserved gravitational stress-energy tensor problem, etc.

parameter are bounded from below, and, as the limiting value is approached, the
mass and the dilaton charge rise indefinitely and tend to a strict equality (in
suitable units). Together with the electric charge they saturate the BPS bound
of the corresponding linear U(1) theory. Beyond this boundary the solutions
become compact (singular), while the limiting solution at the exact boundary
value is non-compact and non-asymptotically flat. The black holes in this

impossible. It is shown that their proof is valid only for a particular model
of quantum bit commitment encoding, in general it does not hold good. A
different model of unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment - both
entanglement and disentanglement-based - is presented. Even cheating can be
legally proved with some legal evidences. Unconditionally secure quantum bit
commitment can be established on the top of unconditionally secure quantum coin
tossing, which is also claimed to be two-way impossible.

itself a subject of research and debate. Earlier works on quantum cryptography
have almost established that entanglement has no special advantage in quantum
cryptography. In this paper we reveal that entanglement is better ingredient
than disentanglement for our alternative quantum cryptography.

studied. Several versions of the algorithm are applied to the two-dimensional,
square lattice Ising model with a staggered field. The dynamic exponent for the
full algorithm is found to be less than 0.4. It is found that odd translations
of one replica with respect to the other together with global flips are
essential for obtaining a small value of the dynamic exponent.

entangled state leads to Bell's inequality, a violation of which signifies the
nonlocal nature of a single particle.

strong electron-phonon coupling creates a coherent superposition of a low

excited state and the ground state of the coherent transition. As the excited
state is accelerated further, interference between the high momentum ground
state contribution and the low momentum excited state contribution causes a
photon echo. This photon echo is a direct consequence of quantum interference
between separate vibrational trajectories and can therefore provide
experimental evidence of the non-classical properties of molecular vibrations.

information processing. In the HQC strategy information is encoded in
degenerate eigen-spaces of a parametric family of Hamiltonians. The
computational network of unitary quantum gates is realized by driving
adiabatically the Hamiltonian parameters along loops in a control manifold. By
properly designing such loops the non-trivial curvature of the underlying
bundle geometry gives rise to unitary transformations i.e., holonomies that
implement the desired unitary transformations. Conditions necessary for
universal QC are stated in terms of the curvature associated to the non-abelian
gauge potential (connection) over the control manifold. In view of their
geometrical nature the holonomic gates are robust against several kind of
perturbations and imperfections. This fact along with the adiabatic fashion in
which gates are performed makes in principle HQC an appealing way towards
universal fault-tolerant QC.
