questions in astrophysics. In this talk, I address possible stellar baryonic
contributions to the 50-90% of our Galaxy that is made of unknown dark matter.
First I show that faint stars and brown dwarfs constitute only a few percent of
the mass of the Galaxy. Next, I show that stellar remnants, including white
dwarfs and neutron stars, are also insufficient in abundance to explain all the
dark matter of the Galaxy. High energy gamma-rays observed in HEGRA data place
the most robust constraints, $\Omega_{WD} < 3 \times 10^{-3} h^{-1}$, where $h$
is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Overproduction
of chemical abundances (carbon, nitrogen, and helium) provide the most
stringent constraints, $\Omega_{WD} < 2 \times 10^{-4} h^{-1}$. Comparison with
recent updates of microlensing data are also made. According to the gamma-ray
limit, all Massive Compact Halo Objects seen by the experiments (Machos) can be
white dwarfs if one takes the extreme numbers; however, from chemical
overproduction limits, NOT all Machos can be white dwarfs. Comments on recent
observations of the infrared background and of white dwarfs are also made. In
conclusion, a nonbaryonic component in the Halo seems to be required.

spectroscopic sample includes over 140 objects in the HDF proper, representing
the deepest, cleanest, most complete spectroscopic catalog ever compiled. We
study each object for which our redshift and the one measured by Cohen et al
disagree. In most cases the photometric evidence is strong enough to call for a
careful review of the spectroscopic values, as they seem to be in error. It is
possible to characterize the systematic errors associated to our technique,
which when combined with the photometric errors allow us to obtain complete
information on the redshift of each galaxy and its associated confidence
interval, regardless of apparent magnitude. One of the main conclusions of this
study is that, to date, all the redshifts from our published catalog that have
been checked have been shown to be correct (within the stated confidence
limits). This implies that our galaxy template set is a fair representation of
the galaxy population at all redshifts (0<z<6) and magnitudes (R<24) explored
to date. On the other hand, spectroscopy of faint sources is subject to unknown
and uncharacterized systematic errors, that will in turn be transmitted to any
photometric redshift technique which uses spectroscopic samples as calibration.
Our analysis proves that photometric redshift techniques can and must be used
to extend the range of applicability of the spectroscopic redshift
measurements. (Abridged)

less than 90 degrees (implying a positive ac conductivity), increasing to 90

remote location on the same surface. The purpose of the present paper is to
interpret this experiment with a model Hamiltonian, using ellipses of the size
of the experimental ones, containing about 2300 atoms. The charge distribution
for the different wavefunctions is analyzed, in particular, for those with
energy close to the Fermi energy of copper Ef. Some of them show two symmetric
maxima located on the principal axis of the ellipse but not necessarily at the
foci. If a Co atom is adsorbed at the site where the wavefunction with energy
$E_F$ has a maximum and the interaction is small, the main effect of the
adsorbed atom will be to split this particular wavefunction in two. The total
charge density will remain the same but the local density of states will
present a dip at Ef at any site where the charge density is large enough. We
relate the presence of this dip to the observation of quantum mirages. Our
interpretation suggests that other sites, apart from the foci of the ellipses,
can be used for projecting atomic images and also indicates the conditions for
other non magnetic adsorbates to produce mirages.

potential energy surface of model liquids has been increasingly studied since
it provides a connection between the configurational component of the partition
function on one hand, and the system dynamics on the other. This connection is
most obvious at low temperatures, where the motion of the system can be
partitioned into vibrations within a basin of attraction and infrequent
inter-basin transitions. In this work, we present a description of the

of this model has been studied in great details in the last years.
Specifically, we locate the minima sampled by the liquid by ``quenches'' from
equilibrium configurations generated via molecular dynamics simulations. We
calculate the temperature and density dependence of the basin energy,
degeneracy, and shape. The temperature dependence of the energy of the minima
is qualitatively similar to simple liquids, but has anomalous density
dependence. The unusual density dependence is also reflected in the
configurational entropy, the thermodynamic measure of degeneracy. Finally, we
study the structure of simulated water at the minima, which provides insight on
the progressive tetrahedral ordering of the liquid on cooling.

evidenced by the significant drop in the average coordination number of Si. By

gluonic domain walls interpolating between them. The walls may separate the
genuine vacuum from an excited one, or two excited vacua which are unstable at
finite N (here N is the number of colors). One may attempt to stabilize them by
switching on the axion field. We study how the light quarks and the axion
affect the structure of the domain walls. In pure gluodynamics (with the axion
field) the axion walls acquire a very hard gluonic core. Thus, we deal with a
wall ""sandwich"" which is stable at finite N. In the case of the minimal axion,
the wall ""sandwich"" is in fact a ""2-pi"" wall, i.e., the corresponding field
configuration interpolates between identical hadronic vacua. The same
properties hold in QCD with three light quarks and very large number of colors.
However, in the realistic case of three-color QCD the phase corresponding to
the axion field profile in the axion wall is screened by a dynamical phase
associated with the eta-prime, so that the gluon component of the wall is not
excited. We propose a toy Lagrangian which models these properties and allows
one to get exact solutions for the domain walls.

signals the instability of the system to form a bound state of the D0-brane
with the D4-brane. We use the Wess-Zumino-Witten like open superstring field
theory formulated by Berkovits to study the tachyon potential for this system.
The tachyon potential lies outside the universality class of the D-brane
anti-D-brane system. It is a function of the B-field. We calculate the tachyon
potential at the zeroth level approximation. The minimum of the tachyon
potential in this case is expected to reproduce the mass defect involved in the
formation of the D0/D4 bound state. We compare the minimum of the tachyon
potential with the mass defect in three cases. For small values of the B-field
we obtain 70% of the expected mass defect. For large values of the B-field with
Pf$(2\pi\alpha' B) >0$ the potential reduces to that of the D-brane
anti-D-brane reproducing 62% of the expected mass defect. For large values of
the B-field with Pf$(2\pi\alpha' B) <0$ the minimum of the tachyon potential
gives 25% of the expected mass defect. At the tachyon condensate we show that

Seiberg-Witten curves of theories with $\SUSY{2}$ in 3+1D. In particular, we
argue that the moduli space of instantons of $U(q)$ Yang-Mills theories on a

theories with ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetry. The theories are obtained by
compactifying the heterotic little-string theory on $T^3$ with global twists.

concept that seismicity prior to a large earthquake can be understood in terms
of the statistical physics of a critical phase transition. In this model, the
cumulative Benioff strain (BS) increases as a power-law time-to-failure before
the final event. This power law reflects a kind of scale invariance with
respect to the distance to the critical point. A few years ago, on the basis of
a fit of the cumulative BS released prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,
Sornette and Sammis [1995] proposed that this scale invariance could be
partially broken into a discrete scale invariance (DSI). The observable
consequence of DSI takes the form of log-periodic oscillations decorating the
accelerating power law. They found that the quality of the fit and the
predicted time of the event are significantly improved by the introduction of
log-periodicity. Here, we present a battery of synthetic tests performed to
quantify the statistical significance of this claim. We find that log-periodic
oscillations with frequency and regularity similar to those of the Loma Prieta
case are very likely to be generated by the interplay of the low pass filtering
step due to the construction of cumulative functions together with the
approximate power law acceleration. Thus, the single Loma Prieta case alone
cannot support the initial claim and additional cases and further study are
needed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio if any. The present study will be
a useful methodological benchmark for future testing of additional events when
the methodology and data to construct reliable Benioff strain function become
available.

Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting
$\alpha=2/3$ in favor of $\alpha=3/4$. For mammals, we find a possible
breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in
$\alpha$. We also review theoretical justifications of $\alpha=3/4$ based on

Wave function coherence times are .1 millisecond. The wave function is read out
using an inverted dc voltage which releases excited electrons from the surface,
or using SETs attached to the metal pads which control the electrons.

color centers via nondegenerate four-wave mixing (NDFWM) and
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The maximal absorption
suppression was found to be 17%, which corresponds to 70% of what is possible
given the random geometric orientation of the N-V center in diamond. In the
context of quantum computing in solids, this level of transparency represents
the efficient preparation of quantum bits (qubits), as well as ability to
perform arbitrary single qubit rotations.

  2001",,,"quant-ph",,"  The capacity of quantum channel with product input states was formulated by
the quantum coding theorem. However, whether entangled input states can enhance
the quantum channel is still open. It turns out that this problem is reduced to
aspecial case of the more general problem whether the capacity of product
quantum channel exhibits additivity. In the present study, we apply one of the
quantum Arimoto-Blahut type algorithms to the latter problem. The results
suggest that the additivity of product quantum channel capacity always holds
and that entangled input states cannot enhance the quantum channel capacity.
