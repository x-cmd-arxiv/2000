ROSAT-discovered holes associated with the radio lobes have X-ray bright rims
which are cooler than the surrounding gas and not due to shocks. The holes
themselves may contain some hotter gas. We map strong photoelectric absorption
across the Northern lobe and rim due to a small infalling irregular galaxy,
known as the high velocity system. Two outer holes, one of which was previously
known, are identified with recently found spurs of low-frequency radio
emission. The spiral appearance of the X-ray cooler gas and the outer optical
parts of NGC 1275 may be due to angular momentum in the cooling flow.

  in the Sonic-Point Beat-Frequency Model","4 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX, uses emulateapj; submitted to ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/323148",,"astro-ph",,"  Previous work on the sonic-point beat-frequency (SPBF) model of the kilohertz
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray flux from neutron
stars in low-mass binary systems has shown that it naturally explains many
properties of these QPOs. These include the existence of just two principal
QPOs in a given source, the commensurability of the frequency separation \Dnu\
of the two kilohertz QPOs and the spin frequency \nus inferred from burst
oscillations, and the high frequencies, coherence, and amplitudes of these
QPOs. Here we show that the SPBF model predicts that \Dnu is less than but
close to \nus, consistent with the observed differences between \Dnu and \nus.
It also explains naturally the decrease in \Dnu with increasing QPO frequency
seen in some sources and the plateau in the QPO frequency--X-ray flux observed
in 4U 1820-30. The model fits well the QPO frequency behavior observed in Sco
X-1, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1728-34, and 4U 1820-30 (chisqdof = 0.4-2.1), giving masses
ranging from 1.59 to 2.0 Msun and spin rates ranging from 279 to 364 Hz. In the
SPBF model, the kilohertz QPOs are effects of strong-field gravity. Thus, if
the model is validated, the kilohertz QPOs can be used not only to determine
the properties of neutron stars but also to explore quantitatively general
relativistic effects in the strong-field regime.

Wolf-Rayet LINER galaxy NGC6764 shows that the most recent star formation is
most likely still unresolved at sub-arcsecond resolution (< 100pc). The
continuum source has a size of about 1.5''. The H_2 emission is resolved
showing a rotating ring/disk of ~1.2'' diameter. An analysis of the nuclear
stellar light using population synthesis models in conjunction with NIR
spectral synthesis models suggests following star formation history: Two
starbursts with decay times of 3 Myr occurred 3 - 5 Myr and 15 - ~50 Myr ago.
Continuous star formation over at least 1Gyr can also explain the observed
parameter. However, the mass relocation and consumption involved as well as the
different spatial distribution of the lines associated with the star formation
strongly favor the 'two starburst' scenario. In that scenario, up to 35% of the
total observed Br_gamma flux could still be due to the AGN. In contrast to
other starburst galaxies (e.g. M82, NGC 7552), the younger starburst in NGC6764
is very likely located closer to the nucleus and surrounded by the older
starburst. One possible explanation can be that the stellar bar still
transports gas down to radii close to the nucleus. This suggests that the
massive star formation activity is directly competing with the AGN for the
fuel. The 44 ksec. HRI ROSAT data show the presence of a X-ray source (probably
an AGN) which varies by more than a factor of 2 over a time scale of 7 days.
This implies the presence of a compact source with a discrete or at most 1000
AU source size. In addition, we find an extended X-ray component which looks
similar to published VLA radio continuum maps.

walkers in a harmonic potential follows a simple exponential pattern and leads
to a normal Boltzmann distribution. The mixed models, describing normal CTRW in

angle with respect to the reaction plane, provide novel information on the
anisotropic shape and orientation of the pion-emitting zone formed in heavy ion
collisions. We present the first experimental determination of this
information, for semi-central Au+Au collisions at 2-6 AGeV. The source
extension perpendicular to the reaction plane is greater than the extension in
the plane, and tilt of the pion source in coordinate space is found to be
opposite its tilt in momentum space.

the delta via parity-violating electron scattering from nuclei are examined,
working within the context of the relativistic Fermi gas model. A strong
enhancement of the left-right asymmetry in the delta sector compared with that
in the quasi-elastic regime is found and the potential to find clear signatures
for the axial-vector contributions of the nucleon-to-delta transition to the
asymmetry identified at specific low momentum transfer kinematics.
Possibilities of probing the deformation of the delta are also explored, and
using both the proton and nuclei as targets, the abilitiy to study the
asymmetry on neutrons is studied.
