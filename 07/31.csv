which were found to be not positionally coincident with any known class of
potential gamma-ray emitters in the Galaxy (Romero, Benaglia & Torres, 1999).
We have performed a variability analysis which reveals that many of these 40
sources are variable. These sources have, in addition, a steep mean value of
the gamma-ray spectral index, $<\Gamma> = 2.41 \pm 0.2$, which, combined with
the high level of variability seems to rule out a pulsar origin. The positional
coincidences with uncatalogued candidates to supernova remnants were also
studied. Only 7 sources in the sample are spatially coincident with these
candidates, a result that is shown to be consistent with the expected level of
pure chance association. A complementary search for weak radio counterparts was
also conducted and the results are presented as an extensive table containing
all significant point-like radio sources within the 40 EGRET fields. We argue
that in order to produce the high variability, steep gamma-ray spectra, and
absence of strong radio counterparts observed in some of the gamma-ray sources
of our sample a new class of objects should be postulated, and we analyze a
viable candidate.

field theory is a correlated limit in which two bare Lagrangian parameters, the
coupling constant $g$ and the {\it negative} mass squared $-m^2$, both approach
infinity with the ratio $-m^2/g=\alpha>0$ held fixed. In this limit the
renormalized mass of the asymptotic theory is finite. Moreover, the limiting
theory exhibits universal properties. For a non-Hermitian $\cal PT$-symmetric
Lagrangian lacking parity symmetry, whose interaction term has the form
$-g(i\phi)^N/N$, the renormalized mass diverges in this correlated limit.
Nevertheless, the asymptotic theory still has interesting properties. For
example, the one-point Green's function approaches the value
$-i\alpha^{1/(N-2)}$ independently of the space-time dimension $D$ for $D<2$.
Moreover, while the Ising limit of a parity-symmetric quantum field theory is
dominated by a dilute instanton gas, the corresponding correlated limit of a
$\cal PT$-symmetric quantum field theory without parity symmetry is dominated
by a constant-field configuration with corrections determined by a
weak-coupling expansion in which the expansion parameter (the amplitude of the
vertices of the graphs in this expansion) is proportional to an inverse power
of $g$. We thus observe a weak-coupling/strong-coupling duality in that while
the Ising limit is a strong-coupling limit of the quantum field theory, the
expansion about this limit takes the form of a conventional weak-coupling
expansion. A possible generalization of the Ising limit to dimensions $D<4$ is
briefly discussed.

which gives directly the 3D potential, without the need of writing the

all N.

r>>r_H persist for a range of temperatures. Thermal effects on the 3-form
source for the hypermultiplet mass m and its order m^2 back reaction on the
other fields of the IIB theory are computed. We find unique solutions which are
regular at the horizon and have the correct behavior on the boundary. For fixed
temperature T, the horizon shrinks for increasing m^2 suggesting that there is
a critical temperature separating the system into high and low temperature
phases. In the high temperature phase 5-branes are unnecessary since there are
no naked singularities. Using the order m^2 correction to the horizon area we

mass; it is postulated that these are the only solutions which represent
individual physical particles. As a consequence two basic principles of
standard QM, namely the superposition principle and the wave-function collapse,
are shown to have no ontological meaning. Three simple applications of our
approach are then examined: the free particle, the linear harmonic oscillator
and the delta barrier potential; the corresponding ""particle"" solutions are
explicitly shown. Finally, it is argued that the persisting confusion about the
meaning of the wave-function (does it represent an individual particle or a
statistical ensemble?) calls for a non-linear extension of the Schroedinger
equation.

two-party zero-sum game can be carried out if the other player is permitted to
adopt quantum measurement strategy.
