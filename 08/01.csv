the absolute magnitude from the new Main Sequence Fitting of Galactic globular

mod(LMC)=18.45+/-0.09. The average I luminosity of the clump stars is

mod(LMC)=18.42+/-0.07 and 18.45+/-0.07 when two metallicity-I relations are

considered. We formulate a model for the local vertical structure of a thin
disk threaded by a poloidal magnetic field of dipolar symmetry. The model
consists of an optically thick disk matched to an isothermal atmosphere. The
disk is supposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective viscosity and an
effective magnetic diffusivity. In the atmosphere, if the magnetic field lines
are inclined sufficiently to the vertical, a magnetocentrifugal outflow is
driven and passes through a slow magnetosonic point close to the surface. We
determine how the rate of mass loss varies with the strength and inclination of
the magnetic field. In particular, we find that for disks in which the mean
poloidal field is sufficiently strong to stabilize the disk against the
magnetorotational instability, the mass loss rate decreases extremely rapidly
with increasing field strength, and is maximal at an inclination angle of 40-50
degrees. For turbulent disks with weaker mean fields, the mass loss rate
increases monotonically with increasing strength and inclination of the field,
but the solution branch terminates before achieving excessive mass loss rates.
Our results suggest that efficient jet launching occurs for a limited range of
field strengths, and a limited range of inclination angles in excess of 30
degrees. In addition, we determine the direction and rate of radial migration
of the poloidal magnetic flux, and discuss whether configurations suitable for
jet launching can be maintained against dissipation.

nuclear components in the galaxies. We detect nuclear sources in five targets,
whose broad-band colours are consistent with reddened quasar spectra. In all
five cases the ratio of the inferred intrinsic near-infrared luminosity to the
narrow-line luminosity is typical of quasars. We find a correlation between the
inferred nuclear extinction and core-to-lobe ratio, which places constraints on
the geometry of the torus. We find evidence for a shift of the K-z relation to
fainter magnitudes, but by a much smaller amount (~0.1 mag) than Taylor et al.

power spectrum is of order 0.1% and is hence comparable to the cosmic variance

(GPC) procedure to calibration data from the first 2 years of The Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS). The GPC algorithm uses photometry of both primary
standards and moderately bright `tracer' stars in 35 2MASS calibration fields.
During the first two years of the Survey, each standard was observed on
approximately 50 nights, with about 900 individual measurements. Based on the
photometry of primary standard stars and secondary tracer stars and under the
assumption that the nightly zeropoint drift is linear, GPC ties together all
calibration fields and all survey nights simultaneously, producing a globally
optimized solution. Calibration solutions for the Northern and Southern
hemisphere observatories are found separately, and are tested for global
consistency based on common fields near the celestial equator.
  Several results from the GPC are presented, including establishing candidate
secondary standards, monitoring of near-infrared atmospheric extinction
coefficients, and verification of global validity of the standards. The
solution gives long-term averages of the atmospheric extinction coefficients,
A_J=0.096, A_H=0.026, A_{K_s}=0.066 (North) and A_J=0.092, A_H=0.031,
A_{K_s}=0.065 (South), with formal error of 0.001. The residuals show small
seasonal variations, most likely due to changing atmospheric content of water
vapor. Extension of the GPC to approximately 100 field stars in each of the 35
calibration fields yields a catalog of more than two thousand photometric
standards ranging from 10th to 14th magnitude, with photometry that is globally

be photometrically distinguished from giants using the Washington filters.
These major contaminates unavoidably reduced the overall giant identification
efficiency to 66% for $M<18.5$. Our improved knowledge of these stars will

pattern (at an optical depth of order unity) to the mass function of the

microlens mass <m>. In particular the mean microlensing caustic crossing rate
was found to be proportional to the squareroot of <m>. We show that while this
is true in the limit of mass functions with a narrow range of mass, in general
the magnification pattern shows structure that reflects the contribution to the
optical depth of microlenses with different masses. We present a better
approximation, relating the microlens mass function to light-curve statistics.
We show that the variability statistics of quasar microlensing light-curves can
(in principle) be inverted to obtain the mass function of the microlenses in
the mass range over which the mass density remains comparable, ie. p(m)dm~C/m.
A preliminary analysis of the structure function for Q2237+0305 suggests that
there is not a significant contribution to the optical depth from very low mass
objects (0.001 solar mass). However observations of multiple microlensed
quasars for a period of ~20 years may in the future yield a detailed p(m)dm. In
the mass range where the number density is comparable, ie. p(m)dm~const., the
distribution of flux factors could be inverted to find the microlens mass
function. This may be used as a probe of the abundance of planets with orbital
radii >100 AU.

submillimeter continuum and CS lines. The data indicate three types of
abundance profiles: flat profiles at CH3OH/H2 ~10^-9 for the coldest sources,
profiles with a jump in its abundance from ~10^-9 to ~10^-7 for the warmer
sources, and flat profiles at CH3OH/H2 ~few 10^-8 for the hot cores. The
location of the jump at T~100 K suggests that it is due to evaporation of grain
mantles, followed by destruction in gas-phase reactions in the hot core stage.
In contrast, the H2CO data can be well fit with a constant abundance of a few x
10^-9 throughout the envelope, providing limits on its grain surface formation.

a temperature-inversion layer on the accretion-disk surface when it is
irradiatively heated by soft X-rays. Single-peaked lines may be emitted from
outflow/wind matter driven by hard X-ray heating. We have constructed a simple
plane-parallel model and we use it to illustrate that a temperature-inversion
layer can be formed at the disk surface under X-ray illumination. We also
discuss the conditions required for the formation of temperature inversion and
line emission. Based on the velocity separations measured for the double-peaked
lines in the high-soft state, we propose that GX339-4 is a low-inclination
binary system. The orbital inclination is about 15 deg if the orbital period is

  The co-moving density of luminous AGN [L(2-10keV)>1E44 erg/s, in the

observed evolution of the quasar population. The abundance of lower luminosity
AGN simultaneously increases, and we identify such objects with the Seyfert
galaxies. These features reflect an epoch-dependent rate of Bondi accretion
from the hot, cooling atmosphere: at z<2.5 most AGN are fed at much less than
10 per cent of the Eddington rate, whilst at z>2.5 most accrete at 10-50 per
cent Eddington. Unlike other models for quasar and galaxy formation, we do not
consider major mergers between normal galaxies.

frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (rf-PECVD) have been
studied for various applications. An interesting property of these films is
their high breakdown strength (107 Vcm-1). This property of a-C:H can be
exploited in high breakdown heterostructure diodes or as passivation layers and
insulator layers in MIS devices. Reports on the applications of a-C:H/Si diodes
exist in the literature. Diodes in which the a-C:H films have been deposited by
rf-PECVD, have been reported only once. In this article the diodes produced
reportedly failed to exhibit reproducible I-V characteristics under high
voltage stress. We have investigated the process dependence of structural and
electrical properties of rf-PECVD a-C:H films deposited at room temperature
from a CH4/Ar gas mixture (at a pressure of 100 mTorr) using a capacitively
coupled rf-PECVD. We observe a clear correlation between the dc-self bias and
the rectification ratio of a-C:H/Si heterojunction diodes. Optimised diodes
show rectification ratios upto 104 and a stable reverse breakdown voltage,
typically around 850 V. I-V and C-V measurements show no evidence of hystersis.
Scanning Electron Microscopy was carried out to determine the quality of the
films deposited. Micro-Raman analysis was used to estimate the ID/IG ratio in
the films deposited under different dc-self bias.

quantum mechanical description of reacting molecules. Our method does not rely

rather uses the electron density of the reactants as the physical variable
describing the cavity. In addition, the precise choice of cavity is made by
ensuring that the dielectric reproduces the correct linear response of the
solvent to electrostatic perturbations. As a model application which is
interesting in its own right, we study the hydrolysis of methylene chloride, a
representative model waste compound in supercritical oxidation experiments, and
which has shown surprising solvation effects close to the critical point of
pure water (T=394$^o$ C, P=221 bar). Using our {\em a priori} methodology, we
find results in good agreement with available experimental reaction barriers.
We then study, in a controlled manner, the relative importance of various
further approximations that are routinely performed in the literature such as
the use of spherical cavities, the replacement of the reactant by a dipole, or
the neglect of self consistency in solving the electrostatic problem.

`low-temperatures', where a logarithmic T-dependence of \rho (with

which Drude resistivity strongly varies with T (with d\rho/dT>0); and [ii]
crossover between the former two, where a linear T-dependence dominates (with
d\rho/dT>0). In the crossover regime and at higher densities
(n>20x10^{11}/cm^2), \rho(T) goes through a minimum at temperature T_{min}.
Both the absolute value of T_{min} and its dependence on density are found to
be in an agreement with the conventional weak-localization theory. For n
smaller than \sim 20x10^{11}/cm^2, the theoretical estimate for T_{min} falls
outside the experimentally accessible temperature range. This explains the
absence of the minimum at these densities in the data. In total, over the two

from computer simulations in equilibrium, i.e. without an external

we derive an expression to determine the thermal conductivity \lambda from such

we use the derived relations to determine c(z) over eight decades in frequency,

amorphous silica. We find that at high frequencies the real part of c(z) has
the value of an ideal gas. c'(\omega) increases quickly at those frequencies
which correspond to the vibrational excitations of the system. At low
temperatures c'(\omega) shows a second step. The frequency at which this step
is observed is comparable to the one at which the \alpha-relaxation peak is
observed in the intermediate scattering function. Also the temperature
dependence of the location of this second step is the same as the one of the
$\alpha-$peak, thus showing that these quantities are intimately connected to

due to their 1D nature. In particular, correlations imply the breakdown of
Fermi liquid theory and typically lead to Luttinger liquid behavior
characterized by pronounced power-law suppression of the transport current and
the density of states, and spin-charge separation. This paper provides a review
of the current understanding of non-Fermi liquid effects in metallic
single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs). We provide a self-contained theoretical
discussion of electron-electron interaction effects and show that the tunneling
density of states exhibits power-law behavior. The power-law exponent depends
on the interaction strength parameter $g$ and on the geometry of the setup.
  We then show that these features are observed experimentally by measuring the
tunneling conductance of SWNTs as a function of temperature and voltage. These
tunneling experiments are obtained by contacting metallic SWNTs to two
nanofabricated gold electrodes. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM)
measurements show that the measured resistance is due to the contact resistance
from the transport barrier formed at the electrode/nanotube junction. These EFM
measurements show also the ballistic nature of transport in these SWNTs. While
charge transport can be nicely attributed to Luttinger liquid behavior,
spin-charge separation has not been observed so far. We briefly describe a
transport experiment that could provide direct evidence for spin-charge
separation.

the prediction of the mean-field theory. From these behaviors, $T_{\rm {SDW}}$

indicates that the SDW phase in quenched (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$, where $T_{\rm

shows a quadratic behavior above 12T and there is no saturation behavior even

clauses expressing Fsat with clauses expressing the transitivity constraints.
We consider methods to reduce the number of such clauses based on the sparse
structure of the relational variables.
  To use Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), we show that for some sets
E, the OBDD representation of the transitivity constraints has exponential size
for all possible variable orderings. By considering only those relational
variables that occur in the OBDD representation of Fsat, our experiments show
that we can readily construct an OBDD representation of the relevant
transitivity constraints and thus solve the constrained satisfiability problem.

to have important astrophysical implications (including the emission of
detectable gravitational radiation, the explanation of the initial spins of
young neutron stars and the spin-distribution of millisecond pulsars and the
explanation of one type of gamma-ray bursts), provided that r-modes are not
saturated at low amplitudes by nonlinear effects or by dissipative mechanisms.
Here, we present the first study of nonlinear r-modes in isentropic, rapidly
rotating relativistic stars, via 3-D general-relativistic hydrodynamical
evolutions. Our numerical simulations show that (1) on dynamical timescales,
there is no strong nonlinear coupling of r-modes to other modes at amplitudes
of order one -- unless nonlinear saturation occurs on longer timescales, the
maximum r-mode amplitude is of order unity (i.e., the velocity perturbation is
of the same order as the rotational velocity at the equator). An absolute upper
limit on the amplitude (relevant, perhaps, for the most rapidly rotating stars)
is set by causality. (2) r-modes and inertial modes in isentropic stars are
predominantly discrete modes and possible associated continuous parts were not
identified in our simulations. (3) In addition, the kinematical drift
associated with r-modes, recently found by Rezzolla, Lamb and Shapiro (2000),
appears to be present in our simulations, but an unambiguous confirmation
requires more precise initial data. We discuss the implications of our findings
for the detectability of gravitational waves from the r-mode instability.

the past null cone of the field point (chosen to be within the near zone when
calculating equations of motion, and in the far zone when calculating
gravitational radiation). The ``inner'' part of this integral(within a sphere
of radius $\cal R \sim$ one gravitational wavelength) is approximated in a
slow-motion expansion using standard techniques; the ``outer'' part, extending
over the radiation zone, is evaluated using a null integration variable. We
show generally and explicitly that all contributions to the inner integrals
that depend on $\cal R$ cancel corresponding terms from the outer integrals,
and that the outer integrals converge at infinity, subject only to reasonable

account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Comparing results of
perturbative and nonperturbative studies is not straightforward, however, due
to the different coupling constant definitions. The perturbative one stems from
the $\bar{\mathrm{MS}}$ subtraction scheme, while the nonperturbative one uses
the static quark potential. The momentum-space perturbative static potential is
calculated in the SU(2)--Higgs model, and is Fourier transformed into
coordinate space. Based on the connection between the coupling constants,
two-loop perturbative and 4-dimensional lattice simulation results are
contrasted. The thermodynamical parameters of the phase transition indicate
that perturbative results are reliable only for low Higgs masses, far from the
endpoint. The value of the endpoint can be refined to $72.1\pm1.4$ GeV. The
Higgs mass range for which dimensional reduction yields reliable results is
identified. As an extension of the standard model, the MSSM is also studied.
Some useful trends are indicated by a simple one-loop perturbative approach:
baryogenesis requirements are more easily met if the stop is lighter thanthe
top; colour-breaking phase transition may be possible, etc. In order to perform
4D nonperturbative studies the supercomputer PMS was built at E\""otv\""os
University. The results and the techniques of the simulations of the bosonic
sector of the MSSM performed on PMS are presented. A phase diagram is given,
the bubble wall is studied. The cosmologically relevant part of the parameter
space is analysed. The results show that baryogenesis is possible within the
MSSM if $m_h\leq 103\pm 4$ GeV.

four-dimensional superconformal field theories and a non-Abelian generalization
of electric-magnetic duality at the IR fixed point. This report is a
pedagogical introduction to these phenomena. After presenting some necessary
background material, a detailed introduction to the low-energy non-perturbative
dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ QCD is given. The emergence of new
four-dimensional superconformal field theories and non-Abelian duality is
explained. New non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric $SO(N_c)$ and
$Sp(N_c=2n_c)$ gauge theories, such as the two inequivalent branches, oblique
confinement and electric-magnetic-dyonic triality, are presented. Finally, some
new features of these four-dimensional superconformal field theories are
exhibited: the universal operator product expansion, evidence for a possible
$c$-theorem in four dimensions and the critical behaviour of anomalous
currents. The concluding remarks contain a brief history of electric-magnetic
duality and a discussion on the possible applications of duality to ordinary
QCD.

We have reached the conclusion that in both the formalisms, the Goldstone
theorem of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is rigorously true for the
case of mass-degenerate two flavors of fermions and only approximately valid at
low energy scales for the mass-nondegenerate case, in spite of existence of
some difference between the two formalisms in the imaginary parts of the
denominators of the propagators for scalar bound states. When the two flavors
of fermions have unequal nonzero masses, the induced possible fluctuation
effect for the Higgs particle is negligible if the momentum cut-off in the zero
temperature loops is large enough. All the results show physical equivalence of
the two formalisms in the present discussed problems.

but at first glance only. In the Part one the field-to-particle transition
formalism is applied to the sigma model (string), dilaton gravity and gauged
supergravity 0-brane solutions. In addition to the fact that the
field-to-particle transition is of interest itself it can be regarded also as
the dynamical dimensional reduction which takes into account field fluctuations
as well as one can treat it as the method of the consistent quantization in the
vicinity of the nontrivial vacuum induced by a field solution. It is shown that
in all the cases the end product of the approach is the so-called ""non-minimal
point particle"". In view of this it is conjectured that point particles are not
only the end product but also the underlying base of modern high-energy theory
even more fundamental than the strings. The Part two is hence devoted to the
formal axiomatics of the string-brane approach - there we deepen the
above-mentioned conjecture. It turns out that a point particle can be regarded
as an extended object from the viewpoint of a macroscopic measurement. The
particle is actually observed as the ``cloud'' consisting of the virtual paths
and nothing prevents their deviations from the classical trajectory. Therefore,
for an observer the real particle can be no more viewed as a point object.
However, it cannot be supposed also as a continuous extended object unless we
average over all the deviations. Then we obtain the metabrane, which is the
composite extended object consisting of the microscopical objects (strings) and
cosmological-size ones (3-brane) where the size of a corresponding embedding is
governed by the weight constants arising along with the decomposition.

same spectrum as in bosonic string theory. We also argue that the on-shell

same as for the bosonic string. We check this explicitly for some of the
simpler equations. The gauge transformation of space-time fields induced by
gauge transformations of the loop variables are discussed in some detail. The
unintegrated (i.e. before the Koba-Nielsen integration), regularized version of

alpha(G) is the size of a maximum stable set of G, and core(G) is the
intersection of all its maximum stable sets. In this paper we demonstrate that
in a tree T, of order n greater than 1, any stable set of size greater or equal
to n/2 contains at least one pendant vertex. Hence, we deduce that any maximum
stable set in a tree contains at least one pendant vertex. Our main finding is
the theorem claiming that if T does not own a perfect matching, then at least
two pendant vertices an even distance apart belong to core(T). While it is
proved by Levit and Mandrescu that if G is a connected bipartite graph of order
at least 2, then the size of core(G) is different from 1, our new statement
reveals an additional structure of the intersection of all maximum stable sets
of a tree. The above assertions give refining of one result of Hammer, Hansen
and Simeone, stating that if a graph G is of order less than 2*alpha(G), then
core(G) is non-empty, and also of a result of Jamison, Gunter, Hartnel and
Rall, and Zito, saying that for a tree T of order at least two, the size of
core(G) is different from 1.

the mountains. When the snow is dirty, dirt cones and other structures can form
instead. Building on previous field observations and experiments, this work
presents a theory of ablation morphologies, and the role of surface dirt in
determining the structures formed. The glaciological literature indicates that
sunlight, heating from air, and dirt all play a role in the formation of
structure on an ablating snow surface. The present work formulates a
mathematical model for the formation of ablation morphologies as a function of
measurable parameters. The dependence of ablation morphologies on weather
conditions and initial dirt thickness are studied, focusing on the initial
growth of perturbations away from a flat surface. We derive a single-parameter
expression for the melting rate as a function of dirt thickness, which agrees
well with a set of measurements by Driedger. An interesting result is the
prediction of a dirt-induced travelling instability for a range of parameters.
