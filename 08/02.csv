dependence of hot gas flows in X-ray luminous giant elliptical galaxies on the
efficiency of heat supply to the gas. We consider a number of potential heating
mechanisms including Type Ia supernovae and sporadic nuclear activity of a
central supermassive black hole. As a starting point for this research we use
an equilibrium hydrostatic recycling model (Kritsuk 1996). We show that a
compact cooling inflow develops, if the heating is slightly insufficient to
counterbalance radiative cooling of the hot gas in the central few kiloparsecs.
An excessive heating in the centre, instead, drives a convectively unstable
outflow. We model the onset of the instability and a quasi-steady convective
regime in the core of the galaxy in two-dimensions assuming axial symmetry.
  Provided the power of net energy supply in the core is not too high, the
convection remains subsonic. The convective pattern is dominated by buoyancy
driven large-scale mushroom-like structures. Unlike in the case of a cooling
inflow, the X-ray surface brightness of an (on average) isentropic convective
core does not display a sharp maximum at the centre. A hybrid model, which
combines a subsonic peripheral cooling inflow with an inner convective core,
appears to be stable. We also discuss observational implications of these
results.

satisfying the following characteristics: a). they are normalised to produce
the observed colours of galaxies at z ~ 0; b). incorporate the
chemo-photometric spectral evolution of galaxies of different types, in
agreement with the observations; c). allow treatment of dust contribution and
its evolution with redshift, consistent with the spectral evolution model; d).
include absorption and re-emission of radiation by dust and hence, realistic
estimates of the far-infrared radiation; e). include correction for
inter-galactic absorption by Lyman continuum and Lyman forest. Using these
template SEDs, the photometric redshifts are estimated to an accuracy of ~
0.11. The effect on the estimated photometric redshifts, due to assumptions in

  The simultaneous and self-consistent modelling of both the photometric and
chemical evolution of galaxies and the effect of dust, makes this technique
particularly useful for high redshift galaxies. Moreover, since the template
SEDs (at different redshifts) cover the range from UV to far-infrared and
sub-mm wavelengths, one could consistently use the optimised SEDs to estimate
the contribution from individual galaxies to these wavelengths, where no

find them to be consistent with the published results from the two data sets of
Riess et al. 1998 (R98) and Perlmutter et al. 1999 (P99). We then examine the
Hubble diagram (HD, i.e., the luminosity-redshift relation) in different
directions on the sky by utilising spherical harmonic expansion. In particular,
via the analysis of the dipole anisotropy, we divide the sky into the two
hemispheres that yield the most discrepant of the three cosmological
parameters, and the scatter $\chi^2_{\rm HD}$ in each case. The most discrepant
values roughly move along the locus $-4\Omega_M +3 \Omega_{\Lambda} = 1$ (cf.
P99), but by no more than $\Delta \approx 2.5$ along this line. For a perfect
FRW universe, Monte Carlo realizations that mimic the current set of SNe yield
values higher than the measured $\Delta$ in $\sim 1/5$ of the cases. We discuss
implications for the validity of the Cosmological Principle, and possible

characteristics of evolutionarily young remnants and some of older ones. To
further elucidate some of its characteristics, we present imaging and
polarimetry of this SNR at a frequency of 1.34 GHz with a resolution of 8
arcsec made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array.
  The indicators of youth are: Morphologically, the radio emission arises in a
smooth shell without the fine scale filaments seen in the optical. Many of the
optical filaments are Balmer dominated. Where measurable, the orientation of
the magnetic field appears to be radial with respect to the center of the
remnant. There may have been a supernova in that region in AD185.
  Indications of older age include: Particularly in RCW86, the bright optical
nebula in the southwestern corner of this extended SNR, but also in other
locations there are several filaments with bright [S II] emission
representative of older shocked filaments in radiative equilibrium. If the
remnant lies at the kinematical distance of 2.8 kpc, it has a diameter of 37 pc
which would be large for a remnant less than two thousand years old.
  The remnant seems to be expanding inside a cavity outlined by infrared
emission and so it could well be young and large. Where it is encountering the
walls of the cavity it is slowing rapidly and we observe the radiative
filaments. RCW86 itself is encountering a dense clump of material but may also
be the remains of a more compact lump of ejecta ploughing into the
surroundings.

Extended [OIII]5007 and H alpha emission are evident around six objects, at the

(16 kpc in the adopted cosmology). Nuclear [OII]3727 is detected in three of
the 5 quasars studied at this wavelength, and clearly extended in one of them.
  The extended [OIII] tends to be brighter on the side of the nucleus with the
stronger, jet-like radio emission, indicating at least that the extranuclear
gas is distributed anisotropically. It is also redshifted by several hundred
km/s from the nuclear [OIII], perhaps because the latter is blueshifted from
the systemic velocity of the host galaxy. Alternatively, the velocity shifts
could be due to infall (which is suggested by line widths ~1000 km/s FWHM) in
combination with a suitable dust geometry. Lyalpha/Halpha ratios well below the
case B value suggest that some dust is present.
  Photoionization modelling of the [OIII]/[OII] ratios in the extended gas
suggests that its pressure is around or less than a few times 1E7 cm^-3 K; any
confining intracluster medium may thus host a strong cooling flow. A comparison
with lower-redshift work suggests that there has been little evolution in the

In this part, we find that, of a wide range of bases each consistent with the

The spinor representation is unfaithful in four dimensional Euclidean space

  Geometry",,,,"math.DG math.AG",,"  Motivated by the picture of mirror symmetry suggested by Strominger, Yau and
Zaslow, we made a conjecture concerning the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of
Calabi-Yau n-folds (with Ricci-flat K\""ahler metric) as one approaches a large
complex structure limit point in moduli; a similar conjecture was made
independently by Kontsevich, Soibelman and Todorov. Roughly stated, the
conjecture says that, if the metrics are normalized to have constant diameter,
then this limit is the base of the conjectural special lagrangian torus
fibration associated with the large complex structure limit, namely an
n-sphere, and that the metric on this S^n is induced from a standard (singular)
Riemannian metric on the base, the singularities of the metric corresponding to
the discriminant locus of the fibration.
  This conjecture is trivially true for elliptic curves; in this paper we prove
it in the case of K3 surfaces. Using the standard description of mirror
symmetry for K3 surfaces and the hyperk\""ahler rotation trick, we reduce the
problem to that of studying K\""ahler degenerations of elliptic K3 surfaces,
with the K\""ahler class approaching the wall of the K\""ahler cone corresponding
to the fibration and the volume normalized to be one. Here we are able to write
down a remarkably accurate approximation to the Ricci-flat metric -- if the
elliptic fibres are of area $\epsilon >0$, then the error is
$O(e^{-C/\epsilon})$ for some constant $C>0$. This metric is obtained by gluing
together a semi-flat metric on the smooth part of the fibration with suitable
Ooguri-Vafa metrics near the singular fibres. For small $\epsilon$, this is a
sufficiently good approximation that the above conjecture is then an easy

partitions and their lattice. The set of reachable configurations of the model,
with the order induced by the transition rule defined on it, is the lattice of
all partitions of an integer, equipped with a dominance ordering. We first
explain how this lattice can be constructed by an algorithm in linear time with
respect to its size by showing that it has a self-similar structure. Then, we
define a natural extension of the model to infinity, which we compare with the
Young lattice. Using a self-similar tree, we obtain an encoding of the obtained
lattice which makes it possible to enumerate easily and efficiently all the
partitions of a given integer. This approach also gives a recursive formula for
the number of partitions of an integer, and some informations on special sets
of partitions, such as length bounded partitions.

special Lagrangian cones in C^m invariant under a subgroup G in SU(m)
isomorphic to U(1)^{m-2}. By writing the special Lagrangian equation as an
o.d.e. in G-orbits and solving the o.d.e., we find a large family of distinct,
G-invariant special Lagrangian cones on T^{m-1} in C^m.
  These examples are interesting as local models for singularities of special
Lagrangian submanifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Such models will be needed to
understand Mirror Symmetry and the SYZ conjecture.

Game, used as a model in physics, economics and computer science. We use order
theory and show that the set of reachable states (i.e. the configuration space)
of such a system started in any configuration is a lattice, which implies
strong structural properties. The lattice structure of the configuration space
of a dynamical system is of great interest since it implies convergence (and
more) if the configuration space is finite. If it is infinite, this property
implies another kind of convergence: all the configurations reachable from two
given configurations are reachable from their infimum. In other words, there is
a unique first configuration which is reachable from two given configurations.
Moreover, the Chip Firing Game is a very general model, and we show how known
models can be encoded as Chip Firing Games, and how some results about them can
be deduced from this paper. Finally, we define a new model, which is a
generalization of the Chip Firing Game, and about which many interesting
questions arise.

the capture rate Gamma_0 = 695 sec^{-1} while, for the triplet hyperfine state,
we obtain the capture rate Gamma_1 = 11.9 sec^{-1} and the neutron asymmetry
alpha_1 = 0.93. If the existing formalism is used to relate these atomic
capture rates to Gamma_{liq}, the OMC rate in liquid hydrogen, then Gamma_{liq}
corresponding to our improved values of Gamma_0 and Gamma_1 is found to be
significantly larger than the experimental value, primarily due to the updated
larger value of g_A. We argue that this apparent difficulity may be correlated
to the specious anomaly recently reported for mu^- + p to n + nu_mu + gamma,
and we suggest a possibility to remove these two ""problems"" simply and
simultaneously by reexamining the molecular physics input that underlies the
conventional analysis of Gamma_{liq}.

enhanced by a combination of multiparticle entanglement together with a higher

superradiance. A specific situation is considered and we show that this effect
can be experimentally observed as a large suppression in trap-loss rates.

simplification arises because of the inefficiency of collective measurements
