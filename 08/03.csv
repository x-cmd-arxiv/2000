extended object between them which we identify as the lensing galaxy. Redshifts
for the galaxy and lensed source have not yet been obtained. For typical lens

non-adiabatic, pressure fluctuations on the compressive modes. We evaluate the
expression for the radial mode excitation rate derived by Nordlund and Stein
(Paper I) using numerical simulations of near surface solar convection. We
first apply this expression to the three radial modes of the simulation and
obtain good agreement between the predicted excitation rate and the actual mode
damping rates as determined from their energies and the widths of their
resolved spectral profiles. We then apply this expression for the mode
excitation rate to the solar modes and obtain excellent agreement with the low
l damping rates determined from GOLF data. Excitation occurs close to the
surface, mainly in the intergranular lanes and near the boundaries of granules
(where turbulence and radiative cooling are large). The non-adiabatic pressure
fluctuations near the surface are produced by small instantaneous local
imbalances between the divergence of the radiative and convective fluxes near
the solar surface. Below the surface, the non-adiabatic pressure fluctuations
are produced primarily by turbulent pressure fluctuations (Reynolds stresses).
The frequency dependence of the mode excitation is due to effects of the mode
structure and the pressure fluctuation spectrum. Excitation is small at low
frequencies due to mode properties -- the mode compression decreases and the
mode mass increases at low frequency. Excitation is small at high frequencies
due to the pressure fluctuation spectrum -- pressure fluctuations become small
at high frequencies because they are due to convection which is a long time
scale phenomena compared to the dominant p-mode periods.

short time-scale variability that is difficult to reconcile with the standard
relativistic shock model. We interpret the observed light curves as a
microlensing event superimposed on power-law flux decays typical of afterglows.
In general, a relativistic GRB shock appears on the sky as a thin ring
expanding at a superluminal speed. Initially the ring is small relative to its
angular separation from the lens and so its flux is magnified by a constant
factor. As the ring grows and sweeps across the lens its magnification reaches
a maximum. Subsequently, the flux gradually recovers its unlensed value. This
behavior involves only three free parameters in its simplest formulation and
was predicted theoretically by Loeb & Perna (1998). Fitting the available
R-band photometric data of GRB 000301C to a simple model of the microlensing
event and a broken power-law for the afterglow, we find reasonable values for
all the parameters and a reduced chi^2/DOF parameter of 1.48 compared with 2.99
for the broken power-law fit alone. The peak magnification of ~2 occurred 3.8
days after the burst. The entire optical-IR data imply a width of the GRB ring
of order 10% of its radius, similar to theoretical expectations. The angular
resolution provided by microlensing is better than a micro-arcsecond. We infer
a mass of approximately 0.5 M_Sun for a lens located half way to the source at
z_s=2.04. A galaxy 2'' from GRB 000301C might be the host of the stellar lens,
but current data provides only an upper-limit on its surface brightness at the

with a previously seen near-infrared reflection nebula and a radio source, and
lies within the known large-scale CO outflow. We also find a new faint NW
source which may be another embedded lower-luminosity star. The IRAS
mid-infrared spectrum of AFGL 2591 shows a large silicate absorption feature at
10 microns, implying that the primary source is surrounded by an optically

simple models can fit the spectra relatively well. Of these models, we explore
two in detail through phase resolved fits. These two models represent the case
of a very optically thick and a very optically thin corona. While systematic
residuals remain at high energies, the overall spectral shape is
well-approximated. The same two basic models are fit to the X-ray light curve,
which shows sinusoidal modulations interpreted as absorption by an opaque disc
rim of varying height. The geometry we infer from these fits is consistent with
previous studies: the disc rim reaches out to the tidal truncation radius,
while the radius of the corona (approximated as spherical) is very close to the
circularization radius. Timing analysis of the RXTE data shows a time lag from
hard to soft consistent with the coronal size inferred from the fits. Neither
the spectra nor the light curve fits allow us to rule out either model, leaving
a key ingredient of the X 1822-371 puzzle unsolved. Furthermore, while previous
studies were consistent with the central object being a 1.4 Msol neutron star,
which has been adopted as the best guess scenario for this system, our light
curve fits show that a white dwarf or black hole primary can work just as well.
Based on previously published estimates of the orbital evolution of X 1822-371,

the major observed emission features by an optically thick water sphere of the

value below a characteristic temperature which is dependent on the cooling
rate. We investigate a correlation function which exhibits aging behaviour, and
follows a master curve in the stationary regime when time is rescaled by a
factor of the relaxation time t_r. This master curve can be fitted by a von
Schweidler law in the late beta-relaxation regime. The relaxation times can be
well-fitted at all temperatures by an offset Arrhenius law. A power law can be
fitted to an intermediate temperature regime; the exponent of the power law and

Mode-coupling Theory. By defining a suitable response function, we find that

a portion of the vortices are positioned between pinning sites can occur.
Depinning of the vortices at the matching fields, where the vortices are
ordered, is elastic while at the incommensurate fields the motion is plastic.
At the incommensurate fields, as the applied driving force is increased, there
can be a transition to elastic flow where the vortices move along the pinning
sites in 1D channels and a reordering transition to a triangular or distorted
triangular lattice. We also discuss the current-voltage curves and how they
relate to the vortex ordering at commensurate and incommensurate fields.

  Bonca et al. (Kluwer Academic Pub., 2001) p.69",,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Superconducting mechanism of cuprates is discussed in the light of the
proximity of the Mott insulator. The proximity accompanied by suppression of
coherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in
finite-dimensional systems. Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of
such differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general
point of view. A typical example of the differentiation is found in the
flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta $(\pi,0)$
and $(0,\pi)$ on 2D square lattices. This flattening even controls the
criticality of the metal-insulator transition. Such differentiation and
suppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting
state in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. The d-wave pairing
interaction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence
of disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. The
superconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is
conceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic
excitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms. Pseudogap phenomena
widely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from
the mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively
coupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones. When we assume the existence of a
strong d-wave channel repulsively competing with AFM fluctuations under the
formation of flat and damped single-particle dispersion, we reproduce basic
properties of the pseudogap seen in the magnetic resonance, neutron scattering,
angle resolved photoemission and tunneling measurements in the cuprates.

by the Calabi-Yau vacuum and the dualities in string/D-branes considered in the
world with some additional dimensions can lead to an extension of the main
principles of the Special Theory of Relativity. The link between the
topological structure of the vacuum and the, hierarchy of the gauge symmetries
could be checked by the existence of the ``almost massless'', ''sterile''
particles. These particles could have flying properties different from the
standard predictions of the STR. It is natural to consider this property for
neutrinos, known up to now ``$U(1)_{em}$ sterile'' particles. Here we discuss
two such effects depending on the possible existence of large and/or small
extra dimensions and what is the maximal speed for both cases.
  The effect of large extra dimensions can be directly connected with the
existence of a hidden boost, $c_{hid} >> c_{em}$, excited by new global
dimensions and can lead to the monotonous rise of the neutrino velocity at high
energies, $v_{\nu} > c$.
  The effect of small extra dimensions, universal with respect to all
particles, can be connected with the gravitation recoils of the propagation of
neutrino in the space-time vacuum-foam and it leads to the effect of
diminishing the neutrino velocity at high energies.
  We propose to check these conjectures for neutrinos of different energies and
species. Limits for existing neutrino data and expected sensitivities of
possible experiments for accelerator - produced neutrinos are considered. It is
pointed out that CERN has the unique opportunity of measuring the indicated
effects.

acting in $\real^n$ can be expressed in terms of functions defined in the orbit
space of $G$. We develop a method to determine the isotropy classes of the
orbit spaces of all the real linear groups whose integrity bases (IB) satisfy
only one independent relation. The method is tested for IB's formed by 3
(independent) basic invariants. The result is obtained through a metric matrix
$\hat P(p)$, defined only from the scalar products between the gradients of a
minimal IB. We determine the matrices $\wP(p)$ from a universal differential
equation, which satisfy new convenient additional conditions, which fit for the
non-coregular case. Our results may be relevant in physical contexts where the
study of covariant or invariant functions is important, like in the
determination of patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field
theory, in the analysis of phase spaces and structural phase transitions
(Landau's theory), in covariant bifurcation theory, in crystal field theory and
so on.

Then, by further specializing to type-II theories (IIA, IIB and a self-dual

equations for the physical fields are formally the same as those of 10D

mathematics. (This is not to be confused with global analysis.) The nonlocal
formulation of physics in \cite{principia} points to a fresh viewpoint in
mathematics: Nonlocal viewpoint. It involves analyzing objects of geometry and
analysis using nonlocal methods, as opposed to the classical local methods,
e.g., Newton's calculus. It also involves analyzing new nonlocal geometries and
nonlocal analytical objects, i.e. nonlocal fields. In geometry, we introduce
and study (nonlocal) forms, differentials, integrals, connections, curvatures,
holonomy, G-structures, etc. In analysis, we analyze local fields using
nonlocal methods (semilocal analysis); nonlocal fields nonlocally (of course);
and the connection between nonlocal linear analysis and local nonlinear
analysis. Analysis and geometry are next synthesized to yield nonlocal (hence
noncommutative) homology, cohomology, de Rham theory, Hodge theory, Chern-Weil
theory, K-theory (called N-theory) and index theory. Applications include
theorems such as nonlocal-noncommutative Riemann-Roch, Gauss-Bonnet, Hirzebruch
signature, etc. The nonlocal viewpoint is also investigated in algebraic
geometry, analytic geometry, and, to some extent, in arithmetic geometry,
resulting in powerful bridges between the classical and nonlocal-noncommutative
aspects.

azimuthal distributions of protons and pi^{-} mesons with respect to the
reaction plane, the flow (the measure of the amount of collective transverse
momentum transfer in the reaction plane) and the parameter a_{2} (the measure
of the anisotropic emission strength) have been extracted. The flow effects
increase with the mass of the particle and the mass number of target A_{T}. The

understanding the back-bending phenomena, where the internal structure of the
yrast band changes dramatically as a function of angular momentum. A
microscopic framework to obtain the diabatic bands within the mean-field
approximation is presented by making use of the selfconsistent collective
coordinate method. Applying the framework, both the ground state rotational
bands and the Stockholm bands are studied systematically for the rare-earth
deformed nuclei. An overall agreement has been achieved between the calculated
and observed rotational spectra. It is also shown that the inclusion of the
double-stretched quadrupole-pairing interaction is crucial to obtain an overall
agreement for the even-odd mass differences and the rotational spectra
simultaneously.

the identity and the fidelity varies monotonically from 1 (for k=0) to 1/2 (for

propagating in a resonance medium undergoes multifold conversions into a Stokes
photon and back. The nontrivial ``cooperative'' behavior of the Stokes
component of light transmitted through the medium is proven to be completely
determined by the interference of scattering amplitudes in different
sub-channels of the Stokes channel, which obviously combines all the
sub-channels with an odd number of photon conversions. The theory of
superfluorescence is then derived as the limiting case of the SRS theory.

the N-dimensional Hilbert space are analysed. Assuming that the corresponding
classical dynamics takes place on the sphere we use the vector SU(2) coherent
states and the generalised Husimi distributions to define the Monge distance
between arbitrary two density matrices. The Monge metric has a simple
semiclassical interpretation and induces a non-trivial geometry. Among all pure
states the distance from the maximally mixed state \rho_*, proportional to the
identity matrix, admits the largest value for the coherent states, while the
delocalized 'chaotic' states are close to \rho_*. This contrasts the geometries
induced by the standard (trace, Hilbert-Schmidt or Bures) metrics, where the
distance from \rho_* is the same for all pure states. We discuss possible
physical consequences including unitary time evolution and the process of
decoherence. We introduce also a simplified Monge metric, defined in the space
of pure quantum states, and more suitable for numerical computation.
