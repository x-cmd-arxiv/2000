sources selected at low frequencies. The accretion rate onto the central black
hole is identified as the basis of a crude physical division of the
low-frequency population into two sub-populations: the first comprises
`Eddington-tuned' (high accretion rate) quasars and their torus-hidden
counterparts; the second comprises `starved quasars' like M87. There exist
remarkable similarities between the shapes and evolutionary behaviours of the
luminosity functions of radio sources and radio-quiet quasars; all luminous AGN
are $\sim300-$times rarer at epochs corresponding to $z \sim 0$ than at $z \sim
2.5$. I argue that any evidence that quasars were intrinsically rarer at $z
\sim 5$ than at $z \sim 2.5$ is as yet both tentative and indirect. A simple
calculation suggests that the radio source population has been over-looked as a
potentially important contributor to the entropy budget of the Universe. A
recent sub-mm survey of radio sources is used to demonstrate a connection
between the events which trigger jets and intense bursts of star formation, and
a close link between the histories of star formation and AGN activity is
proposed. I discuss the aims and methods of future large redshift surveys of
radio sources, emphasising the importance of dovetailing these with the
development of robust physical models for radio sources and their

gravitational lensing. The majority of known pairs are in fact lenses, with a
few confirmed as binaries, leaving a population of objects that have not yet
been successfully classified. Building on the arguments of Kochanek, Falco &
Munoz (1999), it is shown that there are no objective reasons to reject the
binary interpretation for most of these. In particular, the similarity of the
spectra of the quasar pairs appears to be an artifact of the generic nature of
quasar spectra. The two ambiguous pairs discovered as part of the Large Bright
Quasar Survey (Q 1429-053 and Q 2153-0256) are analysed using principle
components analysis, which shows that their spectral similarities are not
greater than expected for a randomly chosen pair of quasars from the survey.
The assumption of the binary hypothesis allows the dynamics, time-scales and
separation distribution of binary quasars to be investigated and constrained.
The most plausible model is that the quasars' activity is triggered by tidal
interactions in a galatic merger, but that the (re-)activation of the galactic
nuclei occurs quite late in the interaction, when the nuclei are within 80+/-30
kpc of each other. A simple dynamical friction model for the decaying orbits
reproduces the observed distribution of projected separations, but the decay
time inferred is comparable to a Hubble time. Hence it is predicted that binary
quasars are only observable as such in the early stages of galactic collisions,
after which the quiescent super-massive black holes orbit in the merger remnant
for some time.

density distributions in these quantities from a sample of about 1000 Sb-Sdm

brightness. The structural parameters of the galaxies were corrected for
internal extinction using a description depending on galaxy surface brightness.
We find that the bivariate space density distribution of spiral galaxies in the
(luminosity, scalesize)-plane is well described by a Schechter luminosity
function in the luminosity dimension and a log-normal scale size distribution
at a given luminosity. This parameterization of the scalesize distribution was
motivated by a simple model for the formation of disks within dark matter
halos, with halos acquiring their angular momenta through tidal torques from
neighboring objects, and the disk specific angular momentum being proportional
to that of the parent halo. However, the fractional width of the scalesize
distribution at a given luminosity is narrower than what one would expect from
using the distribution of angular momenta of halos measured in N-body
simulations. We present several possible explanations for the narrowness of the
observed distribution. Using our bivariate distribution, we find that
determinations of the local luminosity function of spiral galaxies should not
be strongly affected by the bias against low surface brightness galaxies, even
when the galaxies are selected from photographic plates. This may not be true
for studies at high redshift, where (1+z)^4 surface brightness dimming can
cause a significant selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies.

technique of long baseline stellar interferometry in the near-infrared. The
principal result of this paper is that the IOTA interferometer resolves the
source of infrared excess in 11 of the 15 systems surveyed.
  The visibility data for all the sources has been interpreted within the
context of four simple models which represent a range of plausible
representations for the brightness distribution of the source of excess
emission: a Gaussian, a narrow uniform ring, a flat blackbody disk with a
single temperature power law, and an infrared companion. We find that the
characteristic sizes of the near-infrared emitting regions are larger than
previously thought (0.5-5.9 AU, as given by the FWHM of the Gaussian
intensity). A further major result of this paper is that the sizes measured,
when combined with the observed spectral energy distributions, essentially rule
out accretion disk models represented by blackbody disks with the canonical
radial temperature law with exponent -3/4. We also find that, within the range
observed in this study, none of the sources (except the new binary) shows
varying visibilities as the orientation of the interferometer baseline changes.
  Taken as an ensemble, with no clear evidence in favor of axi-symmetric
structure, the observations favor the interpretation that the circumstellar
dust is distributed in spherical envelopes (the Gaussian model) or thin shells
(the ring model).

resolved, and a fractal-like structure is seen. In the case of a constant
density medium the extent of growth is less, and the R-T fingers are found to
be limited by the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz mushroom caps at the tips of the

latter is not affected by the mixing taking place in the interaction region. In
contrast the reverse shock in the case of a CS medium is found to be rippled

probabilities, one of the most important of which is the dynamical
normalisation of elliptical galaxies. Assuming ellipticals' mass distributions
can be modelled as isothermal spheres, the mass normalisation depends on: the
velocity anisotropy; the luminosity density; the core radius; and the area over
which the velocity dispersion is measured. The differences in the lensing
probability and optical depth produced by using the correct normalisation can
be comparable to the differences between even the most extreme cosmological
models. The existing data is not sufficient to determine the correct
normalisation with enough certainty to allow lensing statistics to be used to
their full potential. However, as the correct lensing probability is almost
certainly higher than is usually assumed, upper bounds on the cosmological
constant are not weakened by these possibilities.

to two effects. Firstly, the quasar images themselves increase the observed
flux of the lens, so that lens galaxies up to a magnitude fainter than the
nominal survey limit must be included in the calculation. Secondly, it is
possible for lensed quasars with extremely faint deflectors to enter the survey
due to the extended morphology of the multiple images. Extrapolating these
results to future surveys, the 2 degree Field galaxy redshift survey should
contain between 10 and 50 lenses and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey should yield
between 50 and 300 lenses, depending on the cosmological model and the
observing conditions.

is most often based on a spherical harmonic analysis of the observed
temperature anisotropies. Even if all-sky maps are obtained, however, it is
likely that the region around the Galactic plane will have to be removed due to
its strong microwave emissions. The spherical harmonics are not orthogonal on
the cut sky, but an orthonormal basis set can be constructed from a linear
combination of the original functions. Previous implementations of this
technique, based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, were limited to maximum
Legendre multipoles of l_max < 50 as they required all the modes have
appreciable support on the cut sky, whereas for large l_max the fraction of
modes supported is equal to the fractional area of the region retained. This
problem is solved by using a singular value decomposition to remove the
poorly-supported basis functions, although the treatment of the
non-cosmological monopole and dipole modes necessarily becomes more
complicated. A further difficulty is posed by computational limitations --
orthogonalisation for a general cut requires O(l_max^6) operations and
O(l_max^4) storage and so is impractical for l_max > 200 at present. These
problems are circumvented for the special case of constant (Galactic) latitude
cuts, for which the storage requirements scale as O(l_max) and the operations
count scales as O(l_max^4). Less clear, however, is the stage of the data
analysis at which the cut is best applied. As convolution is ill-defined on the
incomplete sphere, beam-deconvolution should not be performed after the cut,
and, if all-sky component separation is as successful as simulations indicate,
the Galactic plane should probably be removed immediately prior to power
spectrum estimation.

communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates.
However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely
vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that
play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.

The multifractal description of asset fluctuations is generalized into a

scales and between a basket of assets. The reported empirical results show that
this extension is pertinent for financial modelling. The second part of the
paper applies this theory to portfolio optimisation. Our multi-scale
description allows us to characterize the portfolio return distribution at all
time scales simultaneously. The portfolio composition is predicted to change
with the investment time horizon (i.e., the time scale) in a way that can be
fully determined once an adequate measure of risk is chosen. We discuss the use
of the fourth-order cumulant and of utility functions. While the portfolio
volatility can be optimized in some cases for all time horizons, the kurtosis
and higher normalized cumulants cannot be simultaneously optimized. For a fixed
investment horizon, we study in details the influence of the number of periods,
i.e., of the number of rebalancing of the portfolio. For the large risks
quantified by the cumulants of order larger than two, the number of periods has
a non-trivial influence, in contrast with Tobin's result valid in the
mean-variance framework. This theory provides a fundamental framework for the
conflicting optimization involved in the different time horizons and quantifies
systematically the trade-offs for an optimal inter-temporal portfolio
optimization.

symmetry-allowed coupling, and simplify the hamiltonian using a double mean
field approximation (DMFA). A variational coherent state (VCS) trial
wave-function is used for the ground state: the energy, and the relevant order
parameters for SC and FE are obtained. For positive sign of the SC-FE coupling
coefficient, a non-zero value of either order parameter can suppress the other
(FE polarization suppresses SC and vice versa). This gives some support to
""Matthias' Conjecture"" [1964], that SC and FE tend to be mutually exclusive.

(and $T_c $) will increase with increasing applied pressure when pressure
quenches FE as in many ferroelectrics, and b) the FE polarization will increase
with increaesing magnetic field up to $H_c $. The last result is equivalent to

such a light sbottom cannot be ruled out by the constraints from the
electroweak precision data and the present bound on the lightest CP-even Higgs
boson mass at LEP. It is inferred that a light sbottom scenario requires in
general a relatively light scalar top quark whose mass is typically about the
top-quark mass. It is also shown that under these conditions the lightest
CP-even Higgs boson decays predominantly into scalar bottom quarks in most of
the parameter space and that its mass is restricted to m_h ~< 123 GeV.

suggests searching for a solution with the help of dispersion relations and

complementary dimensions in $\Bbb C^n$ is positive. This observation, which has
been called a ``cornerstone'' of algebraic geometry ([GH, p.~62]), is a simple
consequence of the fact that analytic varieties carry a natural orientation.
Recast in terms of linking numbers, it is our principal motivation. It implies
the following: Let $M$ be a smooth oriented compact 3-manifold in $\Bbb C^3$.
Suppose that $M$ bounds a bounded complex 2-variety $V$. Here ``bounds'' means,
in the sense of Stokes' theorem, i.e., that ${b[V]}={[M]}$ as currents. Let $A$
be an algebraic curve in $\Bbb C^3$ which is disjoint from M. Consider the
linking number ${\rm link}(M,A)$ of $M$ and $A$. Since this linking number is
equal to the intersection number (i.e. the sum of the intersection indices) of
$V$ and $A$, by the positivity of these intersection indices, we have ${\rm
link}(M,A) \geq 0$. The linking number will of course be 0 if $V$ and $A$ are
disjoint. (As $A$ is not compact, this usage of ``linking number'' will be
clarified later.) This reasoning shows more generally that ${\rm link}(M,A)
\geq 0$ if $M$ bounds a positive holomorphic 2-chain. Recall that a {\it
holomorphic $k$-chain} in $\Omega \subseteq \Bbb C^n$ is a sum $\sum n_j [V_j]$
where $\{V_j\}$ is a locally finite family of irreducible $k$-dimensional
subvarieties of $\Omega$ and $n_j \in \Bbb Z$ and that the holomorphic 2-chain
is {\it positive} if $n_j >0$ for all $j$. Our first result is that,
conversely, the nonnegativity of the linking number characterizes boundaries of
positive holomorphic 2-chains.

studied the relationship between the enumerative geometry of certain 3-folds
and the Gromov-Witten invariants. In some good cases, enumerative invariants
(which are manifestly integers) can be expressed as a rational combination of
Gromov-Witten invariants. Pandharipande speculated that the same combination of
invariants should yield integers even when they do not have any enumerative
significance on the 3-fold. In the case when the 3-fold is the product of a
complex surface and an elliptic curve, Pandharipande has computed this
combination of invariants on the 3-fold in terms of the Gromov-Witten
invariants of the surface. This computation yields surprising conjectural
predictions about the genus 0 and genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of complex
surfaces. The conjecture states that certain rational combinations of the genus
0 and genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants are always integers. Since the
Gromov-Witten invariants for surfaces are often enumerative (as oppose to
3-folds), this conjecture can often also be interpreted as giving certain
congruence relations among the various enumerative invariants of a surface.
  In this note, we state Pandharipande's conjecture and we prove it for an
infinite series of classes in the case of the projective plane blown-up at 9
points. In this case, we find generating functions for the numbers appearing in
the conjecture in terms of quasi-modular forms. We then prove the integrality
of the numbers by proving a certain a congruence property of modular forms that
is reminiscent of Ramanujan's mod 5 congruences of the partition function.

studying a stability of the quantum ground state (QGS) is suggested, based on
the quasienergy representation. The dynamics depends on four parameters: the
detuning from the resonance, $\delta=\ell-\Omega/\omega$, where $\Omega$ and
$\omega$ are, respectively, the wave and the oscillator's frequencies; the
positive integer (resonance) number, $\ell$; the dimensionless Planck constant,
$h$, and the dimensionless wave amplitude, $\epsilon$. For $\delta=0$, the CGS

$\epsilon$, the QGS becomes more stable with increasing $\delta$ and decreasing

the projected emittance dilution of the bunch train. To suppress the
instability, we propose to introduce an energy spread between the bunches,
similar to the BNS energy spread for damping of the beam breakup within a
single bunch. Based on simple estimates, we show that the energy spread of
order of 1-2% should be enough for suppression of the instability. The results
of computer simulations with the simulation code LIAR confirm theoretical
estimates and indicate that both the tolerances for structure misalignments and

  edited by Bob Coecke, David Moore and Alex Wilce pp. 195-218",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  We present a detailed synthetic overview of the utilisation of categorical
techniques in the study of order structures together with their applications in
operational quantum theory. First, after reviewing the notion of residuation
and its implementation at the level of quantaloids we consider some standard
universal constructions and the extension of adjunctions to weak morphisms.
Second, we present the categorical formulation of closure operators and
introduce a hierarchy of contextual enrichments of the quantaloid of complete
join lattices. Third, we briefly survey physical state-property duality and the
categorical analysis of derived notions such as causal assignment and the
propagation of properties.

  purification in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  A generalization of the quantum XOR-gate is presented which operates in
arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces. Together with one-particle Fourier
transforms this gate is capable of performing a variety of tasks which are
important for quantum information processing in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Among these tasks are the preparation of Bell states, quantum
teleportation and quantum state purification. A physical realization of this
generalized XOR-gate is proposed which is based on non-linear optical elements.

populating of the upper laser level contributed by the collision transfer as
well as by relaxation caused by a buffer gas is discussed in detail. Explicit
formulae for analysis of optimal conditions are derived. The mechanism
developed here for the incoherent pump could be generalized to other systems.

given as a function of the phase space variables for the Liouville integrable
systems of classical mechanics, but only for them. We review the Jacobi-Lie
transformation that explicitly implements this function of positions and
momenta. We then discuss the recently developed quantum formalism for the time
of arrival. We first analyze the case of free particles in one and three space
dimensions. Then, we apply the quantum version of the Jacobi-Lie transformation
to work out the time of arrival operator in the presence of interactions. We
discuss the formalism and its interpretation. We finish by disclosing the
presence (absence) of ""instantaneous"" tunneling for thin (thick) barriers.

induced by mutual interactions can be eliminated using concatenated coding. The
model is solved exactly for arbitrary interaction strength, for two well-known
codes, one and two levels deep: this allows one to see under which
circumstances error amplitudes add coherently or incoherently. For deeper
concatenation, approximate results are derived which make it possible to
calculate an approximate ``threshold'' value for the product of interaction
strength and free evolution time, below which the failure probability for an
encoded qubit decreases exponentially with the depth of the encoding. The
results suggest that concatenated coding could fully handle the errors arising
from mutual interactions, at no extra cost, in terms of resources needed, from
what would be required to deal with random environmental errors.

designed to provide one of three or four distinct outcomes. This has allowed us
to discriminate between nonorthogonal polarization states with an error
probability that is close to the minimum allowed by quantum theory. Employing
these optimal detection strategies on sets of three (trine) or four (tetrad)
equiprobable symmetric nonorthogonal polarization states, we obtain a mutual
information that exceeds the maximum value attainable using conventional (von
Neumann) polarization measurements.
