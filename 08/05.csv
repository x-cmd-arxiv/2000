of compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. We confirm in 3D flows the conclusion from our 2D work that even
apparently weak magnetic fields embedded in Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable plasma
flows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability.
In fact, that statement is strengthened in 3D by this work, because it shows
how field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3D as the quasi-2D Cat's
Eye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. In our simulations twisting
of the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor of
two over the 2D effect. If, by these developments, the Alfv\'en Mach number of
flows around the Cat's Eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggest
magnetic stresses will eventually destroy the Cat's Eye and cause the plasma
flow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow that
retains memory of the original shear. For our flow configurations the regime in
3D for such reorganization is $4\lesssim M_{Ax} \lesssim 50$, expressed in
terms of the Alfv\'en Mach number of the original velocity transition and the
initial Alfv\'en speed projected to the flow plan. For weaker fields the
instability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the Cat's Eye
is destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3D nature. Then,
the flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropic
turbulence. In this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magnetic
energy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which is
retained long afterwards. The magnetic energy eventually catches up to the
kinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.

out a possible negative correlation between the orbital period of the planets

  Undermining the Cosmological Principle","118 pages, 50 figures. PhD Thesis, awarded by the University of
  Glasgow, 1999",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  This thesis concerns the compatibility of inhomogeneous cosmologies with our
present understanding of the universe. It is a problem of some interest to find
the class of all relativistic cosmological models which are capable of
providing a reasonable `fit' to the universe. This thesis, in some respects, is
part of this process. We consider Stephani models, which are a generalisation
of the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models, which can be
thought of as FLRW models with acceleration and pressure gradients. Thus these
models generalise the `dust' assumption of standard cosmology.
  The crucial aspect of this work is the retention of the Copernican principle
-- an assumption regarded by many as crucial to cosmology. It states that we
are not at a special location in the universe. This is a vital aspect of the
original work in this thesis: consideration of an inhomogeneous model, while
retaining the Copernican principle has, as far as the author is aware, not been
considered in detail before.
  We start by generalising the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs Theorem to identify the class
of inhomogeneous spacetimes which allow an isotropic radiation field for all
observers in the spacetime. We then investigate observational and physical
aspects of these models from all observer locations. We conclude that there
exist spacetimes which conform to present observational constraints (especially
anisotropy constraints) for any location in the spacetime, while at the same
time being significantly inhomogeneous; ie, not `almost-FLRW'.

towards three highly obscured AGNs with face-on host galaxies are
systematically larger than the ratios in the Galactic diffuse interstellar

We suggest that the larger ratios can be explained if the obscuring dust is so
close to the central AGNs that a temperature gradient occurs in it. If this
idea is correct, our results may provide spectroscopic evidence for the
presence of the putative ``dusty tori'' in the close vicinity of AGNs.

classical T Tauri stars, the others being weak-lined. The spectral types of
these new T Tauri stars range from F7 to M6. The two new classical T Tauri
stars are located towards two small cloud-lets outside of the main CrA cloud.
They appear to be ~10 Myrs old, by comparing their location in the H-R diagram
with isochrones for an assumed distance of 130 pc, the distance of the main CrA
dark cloud. The new off-cloud weak-line T Tauri stars may have formed in
similar cloud-lets, which have dispersed recently. High-resolution spectra of
our new T Tauri stars show that they have significantly more lithium absorption
than zero-age main-sequence stars of the same spectral type, so that they are
indeed young. From those spectra we also obtained rotational and radial
velocities. For some stars we found the proper motion in published catalogs.
The direction and velocity of the 3D space motion - south relative to the

fractional particles into which the electron breaks apart, there are
non-trivial gapped topological excitations - dubbed ""visons"". A cylindrical

is to superconductivity. This understanding enables us to address a number of
conceptual issues that need to be confronted by any theory of the cuprates

  Appl. Math","Commun Pure Appl Math 54 (2001) 1243-1270",,,"nlin.SI",,"  We develop a unified approach to integrating the Whitham modulation
equations. Our approach is based on the formulation of the initial value
problem for the zero dispersion KdV as the steepest descent for the scalar
Riemann-Hilbert problem, developed by Deift, Venakides, and Zhou, 1997, and on
the method of generating differentials for the KdV-Whitham hierarchy proposed
by El, 1996. By assuming the hyperbolicity of the zero-dispersion limit for the
KdV with general initial data, we bypass the inverse scattering transform and
produce the symmetric system of algebraic equations describing motion of the
modulation parameters plus the system of inequalities determining the number
the oscillating phases at any fixed point on the $x, t$ - plane. The resulting
system effectively solves the zero dispersion KdV with an arbitrary initial
data.

studies of the quantum many-body systems. The results of the projected

theory as a function of the rotational frequency is shown to be smeared out

  1940-1970 circa","This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to wrong treatments
  of some topics",,,,"physics.hist-ph",,"  Experimental tests on `time dilation' began in 1938 with Ives and Stilwell's
work of the transverse Doppler effect due to atoms in inertial flight. Rossi
and Hall (1941) inaugurated the era of fast moving elementary particles that
dominated the scene until the discovery of the Mossbauer effect (1957). This
discovery suggested the use of photons emitted without recoil in crystalline
solids for testing both time dilation and gravitational red shift. Finally,
around 1970, Hafele and Keating dealt again with time dilation by sending
macroscopic atomic clocks around the Earth. The interpretations of these
experiments by experimenters have been characterized by the use of additional
hypotheses not necessary for the formal development of the theories under test
(the idea that all clocks measure proper time) or hypotheses completely
extraneous to the theories themselves (the idea that atoms are clocks). If
these assumptions are dropped, it turns out that the only experiments
concerning time dilation are those performed with elementary particles in
inertial flight. The historical and epistemological implications are discussed.

available. We show that it is possible to approximately visualize in real time
the evolution of the system as far as it is given by $|c_2(t)|^2$. For this
purpose we use a sequence of particular unsharp measurements separated in time.
They are specified within the theory of generalized measurements in which
observables are represented by positive operator valued measures (POVM). A
realization of the unsharp measurements may be obtained by coupling the
two-level system to a meter and performing the usual projection measurements on
the meter only.

  theory","62 pages, LaTeX","Brit.J.Phil.Sci. 52 (2001) 417-470",,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  Philosophical reflection on quantum field theory has tended to focus on how
it revises our conception of what a particle is. However, there has been
relatively little discussion of the threat to the ""reality"" of particles posed
by the possibility of inequivalent quantizations of a classical field theory,
i.e., inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables of the field
in terms of operators on a Hilbert space. The threat is that each
representation embodies its own distinctive conception of what a particle is,
and how a ""particle"" will respond to a suitably operated detector. Our main
goal is to clarify the subtle relationship between inequivalent representations
of a field theory and their associated particle concepts. We also have a
particular interest in the Minkowski versus Rindler quantizations of a free
Boson field, because they respectively entail two radically different
descriptions of the particle content of the field in the very same region of
spacetime. We shall defend the idea that these representations provide
complementary descriptions of the same state of the field against the claim
that they embody completely incommensurable theories of the field.
