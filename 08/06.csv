differences in the rapid X-ray variability between the two main types of
neutron star binaries (i.e., the Z and atoll sources) could be explained by
invoking different mass accretion rates and magnetic field strengths. However,
the results obtained with RXTE now show that these systems are more similar
than previously thought and although differences in mass accretion rate are
still likely, the differences in the magnetic field strength have become
questionable. The great similarities between the neutron star systems and the
black-hole candidates at low mass accretion rates also point towards a similar
origin of their timing phenomena indicating that the presence or absence of a
solid surface, a magnetic field, or an event horizon do not play a significant
role in the production mechanisms for the rapid X-ray variability.

neutron stars (NSs) born rotating rapidly (~ 10-100 ms). These neutron stars
are thought to be created in supernova explosions involving massive stars,
which give rise to expanding supernova remnants (SNRs). With over 220 Galactic
SNRs known (Green 1998) and over 1200 radio pulsars detected (Camilo et al.
2000), it is quite surprising that few associations between the two populations
have been identified with any certainty. Here we report the discovery of a
remarkable 0.3 sec X-ray pulsar, PSR J1846-0258, associated with the supernova
remnant Kes 75. With a characteristic age of only 723 yr, consistent with the
age of Kes 75, PSR J1846-0258 is the youngest pulsar yet discovered and is
being rapidly spun down by torques from a large magnetic dipole of strength ~
5E13 G, just above the so-called quantum critical field. PSR J1846-0258 resides
in this transitional regime where the magnetic field is hypothesized to
separate the regular pulsars from the so-called magnetars. PSR J1846-0258 is
evidently a Crab-like pulsar, however, its period, spin-down rate, spin-down
conversion efficiency, are each an order-of-magnitude greater, likely the
result of its extreme magnetic field.

(sub-mm) spectral energy distribution (SED) of spiral galaxies. We use a
consistent treatment of grain heating and emission, solve the radiation
transfer problem for a finite disk and bulge, and self-consistently calculate
the stochastic heating of grains placed in the resulting radiation field.
  We use this tool to analyse the well-studied nearby edge-on spiral galaxy
NGC891. First we investigate whether the old stellar population in NGC891,
along with a reasonable assumption about the young stellar population, can
account for the heating of the dust and the observed far-infrared (FIR) and
sub-mm emission. The dust distribution is taken from the model of Xilouris et
al. (1999), who used only optical and near-IR observations to determine it. We
have found that such a simple model cannot reproduce the SED of NGC891,
especially in the sub-mm range. It underestimates by a factor of 2-4 the
observed sub-mm flux.
  A number of possible explanations exist for the missing sub-mm flux. We
investigate a few of them and demonstrate that one can reproduce the observed
SED in the FIR and the sub-mm quite well, as well as the observed radial
profile at 850 microns. For the models calculated we give the relative
proportion of the dust radiation powered by the old and young stellar
populations as a function of FIR/sub-mm wavelength. In all models we find that
the dust is predominantly heated by the young stellar population.

in pressure equilibrium) is investigated numerically in three dimensions for
the case of an adiabatically stratified layer covering 6-9 pressure scale
heights. It is found that these bubbles can travel to large heights before
being braked by the excess pressure that builds up in order to drive the gas
sideways in the head of the bubble. Until this happens, the momentum of the
bubble grows as described by the time-integrated buoyancy force. This validates
the simple theory of bubble dynamics whereby the mass entrainment of the bubble
provides an effective braking force well before the bubble stops ascending.
This is quantified by an entrainment parameter alpha which is calculated from
the simulations and is found to be in good agreement with the experimental
measurements. This work is discussed in the context of contact binaries whose
secondaries could be subject to dissipative heating in the outermost layers.

out-of-equilibrium systems with aging phenomena is investigated theoretically
by using only aging properties of the two-time correlation functions and the
generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We show that there are two
experimental time regimes characterized by different thermal properties. In the
first regime where the waiting time is much longer than the measurement time,
the principle of minimum work holds even though a system is out of equilibrium.
In the second regime where both the measurement time and the waiting time are
long, the thermal properties are completely different from properties in
equilibrium. For the single-correlation-scale systems such as $p$-spin
spherical spin-glasses, contrary to a fundamental assumption of thermodynamics,
the work done in an infinitely slow operation depends on the path of change of
the external field even when the waiting time is infinite. On the other hand,
for the multi-correlation-scale systems such as Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model,
the work done in an infinitely slow operation is independent of the path. Our
results imply that in order to describe thermodynamic properties of systems
with aging it is essential to consider the experimental time scales and history
of a system as a state variable is necessary.

magnetic order parameter in the low temperature phase of the XY model of finite
size. In two-dimensions this system is critical over the whole of the low

hypothesis that, in this case, the distribution is non-Gaussian and of
universal form, independent of both system size and critical exponent $\eta$.
An exact expression for the generating function of the distribution is
obtained, which is transformed and compared with numerical data from high
resolution molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The calculation is
extended to general dimension and an exponential tail is found in all
dimensions less than four, despite the fact that critical fluctuations are
limited to D=2. These results are discussed in the light of similar behaviour
observed in models of interface growth and for dissipative systems driven into
a non-equilibrium steady state.
