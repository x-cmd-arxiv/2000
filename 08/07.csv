It is inevitable for the ejected blob to drastically expand into its

electrons should be accelerated, which may lead to nonthermal flares, since a
strong shock will be formed by the interaction between the blob and its
surroundings. Then the blob cools down efficiently, leading to the appearance
of recombination lines about $10^5$s after its ejection from an ADAF. We apply
this model to NGC 4258 for some observational prediction, and to PKS 2149--306

evolutionary linkage between the early active QSO phase and the central black

with a mean of ~10^{-3.5}, about one magnitude lower than the value in early

arrival on Earth of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays with energies above the GZK
threshold. The recent observation of 20TeV photons from Mk 501 is another
somewhat similar paradox. Several models have been proposed for the UHECR
paradox. No solution has yet been proposed for the TeV-$\gamma$ paradox.
Remarkably, the drastic assumption of a violation of ordinary Lorentz
invariance would resolve both paradoxes. We present a formalism for the
description of the type of Lorentz-invariance deformation (LID) that could be
induced by non-trivial short-distance structure of space-time, and we show that
this formalism is well suited for comparison of experimental data with LID
predictions. We use the UHECR and TeV-$\gamma$ data, as well as bounds on
time-of-flight differences between photons of different energies, to constrain
the LID parameter space. A model with only two parameters, an energy scale and
a dimensionless parameter characterizing the functional dependence on the
energy scale, is shown to be sufficient to solve both the UHECR and the
TeV-$\gamma$ threshold anomalies while satisfying the time-of-flight bounds.
The allowed region of the two-parameter space is relatively small, but,
remarkably, it fits perfectly the expectations of the quantum-gravity-motivated
space-time models known to support such deformations of Lorentz invariance:
integer value of the dimensionless parameter and characteristic energy scale
constrained to a narrow interval in the neighborhood of the Planck scale.

the lepton fraction $Y_{\rm L}$ in addition to those in the nuclear surface
tension $E_{\rm surf}$ and in the proton chemical potential in bulk neutron
matter $\mu_{\rm p}^{(0)}$. The phase diagrams obtained at zero temperature
show that only the phases with rod-like and slab-like nuclei occur at typical
values of $Y_{\rm L}$, $E_{\rm surf}$ and $\mu_{\rm p}^{(0)}$, whereas the
bubble phases, especially with spherical bubbles, are at best expected at
hypothetically low values of $Y_{\rm L}$ and/or $E_{\rm surf}$. For the
rod-like and slab-like nuclei, thermally induced displacements are calculated
from their respective elastic constants. It is found that at temperatures
appropriate to supernova cores, thermal fluctuations would destroy the layered
lattice of slab-like nuclei almost independently of the nuclear models and of
the degree of the neutrino degeneracy.

chromospheric fluxes are derived, and a homogeneous sample of more than 100
giants is built adding data from the literature. In addition, for most stars,
rotational velocities were derived from CORAVEL observations. By comparing
chromospheric emission in the cluster stars we confirm that chromospheric
activity depends on T_eff, and mass, when intermediate mass stars (M~4 Msun)
are considered. The Hyades and Praesepe clump giants show the same level of
activity, as expected from stars with similar masses and T_effs. A difference
of up to 0.4 dex in the chromospheric fluxes among the Hyades giants is
recorded and this sets a clear limit to the intrinsic spread of stellar
activity in evolved giants. Among the field stars none of the giants with
(V-R)<0.4 and Ia supergiants observed shows a signature of Ca II activity. We
find that chromospheric activity scales linearly with stellar rotational
velocity and a high power of stellar effective temperature: F'_k propto
T_eff^7.7 Vsini^0.9. This result can be interpreted as the effect of two
chromospheric components of different nature: one mechanical and one magnetic.
For each range of masses activity can simply be expressed as a function of only
one parameter: either the T_eff or the angular rotation Omega. For the 1.6-3
solar mass stars the data are consistent with I Omega=const, while lower and
higher masses follow a law similar to I Omega^2=const. We find it intriguing
that Vsini remains almost constant for 1Msun stars along their evolution; if a
similar behavior is shared by Pop II stars, this could explain the relatively
high degree of activity observed in Pop II giants.

by means of intermediate energy transfer to the first harmonic at the frequency
$\omega/3$ and can be controlled by this mode. By analogy the same medium

that if g is of type A_4 there are close relationships between the Lusztig
cones, canonical basis elements and the regions of linearity of
reparametrization functions arising from the above parametrizations. A graph
can be defined on the set of simplicial regions of linearity with respect to
adjacency, and we further show that this graph is isomorphic to the graph with
vertices given by the reduced expressions of the longest word of the Weyl group

simple model is recalled, and possible variations discussed. It is shown
numerically that despite its simplicity, it can mimic a size effect comparable
to a crash. Two extensions of this model are presented that allow to simulate
the demand process. One of these extensions has a coherent stable equilibrium
and is self-organized, while the other has a bistable equilibrium, with a
spontaneous segregation of the population of agents. A new model is introduced
to generate a transition between those two equilibriums. We show that the
coherent state is dominant up to an equal mixing of the two extensions. We
focuss our attention on the microscopic structure of the investment rate, which
is the main parameter of the original model. A constant investment rate seems
to be a very good approximation.

analyzing spin observables in nucleon inelastic and charge exchange reactions
leading to the continuum. It utilizes response functions calculated by the
continuum random phase approximation (RPA), which include the effective mass,
the spreading widths and the \Delta degrees of freedom. The Fermi motion is
treated by the optimal factorization, and the non-locality of the
nucleon-nucleon t-matrix by an averaged reaction plane approximation. By using
the formalism we calculated the spin-longitudinal and the spin-transverse cross
sections, ID_q and ID_p, of 12C, 40Ca (\vec{p},\vec{n}) at 494 and 346 MeV. The
calculation reasonably reproduced the observed ID_q, which is consistent with
the predicted enhancement of the spin-longitudinal response function R_L.
However, the observed ID_p is much larger than the calculated one, which was
consistent with neither the predicted quenching nor the spin-transverse
response function R_T obtained by the (e,e') scattering. The Landau-Migdal
parameter g'_N\Delta for the N\Delta transition interaction and the effective
mass at the nuclear center m^*(r=0) are treated as adjustable parameters. The
present analysis indicates that the smaller g'_{N\Delta}(\approx 0.3) and
m^*(0) \approx 0.7 m are preferable. We also investigate the validity of the
plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) with the effective nucleon number
approximation for the absorption, by means of which R_L and R_T have
conventionally been extracted.

The case of single-photon detection with noisy, inefficient detectors and
copiers (single controlled-NOT gates in this case) is investigated in detail.
The improvement in distinguishability between a photon and vacuum is found to
occur for a wide range of parameters, and to be quite robust to random noise.
