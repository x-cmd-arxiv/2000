Mergers of clusters of galaxies might provide large enough cosmic ray injection
rates and at the same time provide the mechanism for the heating of the
intracluster medium to the observed temperatures. In this paper we analyze
critically all the components that play a role in the non-thermal emission of

over half a magnitude. We compare the optical re-flare light curves with the
total X-ray flux, the power-law flux and disk flux light curves constructed

During the first 60 days of the observed optical re-flare, we find no

the latter declines exponentially and exhibits three substantial dips. However,
the power law flux is anti-correlated with the optical dips, suggesting that
the optical flux may by up-scattered into the X-ray by the hot corona. Periodic
modulations were discovered during the final stage of the outburst (May to

increasingly prominent. The Low State line profile is very strong (~0.5 keV
equivalent width) and centered at 6.7 +/- 0.10 keV; disk line emission model

nuclear star cluster have given key new insights about the dynamics, evolution
and mass distribution in the Milky Way Center. The central parsec is powered by
a cluster of hot, massive stars which must have formed a few million years ago.
Either star formation was triggered in the central parsec by the infall of a
very dense cloud, or a dense, young star cluster formed outside of the central
parsec sank rapidly into the nuclear region through dynamical friction. The
presence of luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars suggests that there
were earlier such star formation episodes. Measurements of radial and proper
motions for more than 200 stars delineate the stellar dynamics to a scale of a
few light days from the dynamic center which is coincident with the compact
radio source (SgrA*) within ~0.1"" (800 AU). The stellar velocities increase
toward SgrA* with a Kepler law (to >1000 km/s for the innermost stars),
implying the presence of a three million solar mass central (dark) mass. The
observations make a compelling case that this mass concentration is a black
hole which is currently accreting at a low rate or radiating at low efficiency.
With the exception of the young, massive stars the velocity field of the
central stellar cluster is close to isotropic. The young stars are
characterized by a turbulent rotation pattern that still carries the imprint of
the angular momentum distribution in the original cloud or star cluster.

-27.5<M_1450<-25.5 (Omega=1, H_0=50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). We use the selection
function derived in Paper III to correct for sample incompleteness. The
luminosity function is estimated using three different methods: (1) the 1/V_a

(3) Lynden-Bell's non-parametric C^- estimator. All three methods give
consistent results. The luminous quasar density decreases by a factor of ~ 6
from z=3.5 to z=5.0, consistent with the decline seen from several previous
optical surveys at z<4.5. The luminosity function follows psi(L) ~ L^{-2.5} for
z~4 at the bright end, significantly flatter than the bright end luminosity
function psi(L) \propto L^{-3.5} found in previous studies for z<3, suggesting
that the shape of the quasar luminosity function evolves with redshift as well,

analyse the shock waves in three-dimensional numerical simulations of uniformly
driven supersonic turbulence, with and without magnetohydrodynamics and
self-gravity. We can identify the nature of the turbulence by measuring the

  We find that uniformly driven turbulence possesses a power law distribution
of fast shocks with the number of shocks inversely proportional to the square
root of the shock jump speed. A tail of high speed shocks steeper than Gaussian
results from the random superposition of driving waves which decay rapidly. The
energy is dissipated by a small range of fast shocks. These results contrast
with the exponential distribution and slow shock dissipation associated with
decaying turbulence.
  A strong magnetic field enhances the shock number transverse to the field
direction at the expense of parallel shocks. A simulation with self-gravity
demonstrates the development of a number of highly dissipative accretion

predictive of low-temperature behavior. At low temperatures we found results on
the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin glass consistent with a double
degeneracy of the ground-state: the order-parameter distribution function
$P(q)$ converged to two delta-function peaks and the Binder parameter
approached unity as the system size was increased. With the same density of
states used to compute these properties at low temperature, we found their
behavior changing as the temperature is increased towards the spin glass
transition temperature. Just below this temperature, the behavior is consistent
with the standard mean-field picture that has an infinitely degenerate ground
state. Using the concept of zero-energy droplets, we also discuss the structure
of the ground-state degeneracy. The size distribution of the zero-energy
droplets was found to produce the two delta-function peaks of $P(q)$.

and second generation matter scalars, and sub-TeV third generation and Higgs
scalars) have been proposed to ameliorate phenomenological problems arising
from flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) and CP violating processes, while
satisfying conditions of naturalness. Models with an IMH already in place at
the GUT scale have been shown to be constrained in that for many model
parameter choices, the top squark squared mass is driven to negative values. We
delineate regions of parameter space where viable models with a GUT scale IMH
can be generated. We find that larger values of GUT scale first and second
generation scalar masses act to suppress third generation scalars, leading to
acceptable solutions if GUT scale gaugino masses are large enough. We show
examples of viable models and comment on their characteristic features. For
example, in these models the gluino mass is bounded from below, and effectively
decouples, whilst third generation scalars remain at sub-TeV levels. While
possibly fulfilling criteria of naturalness, these models present challenges
for detection at future pp and e^+e^- collider experiments.
