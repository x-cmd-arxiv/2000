and global star formation. Computer simulations of galaxy collisions, in which
at least one galaxy has a significant gaseous component, show the production of
density enhancements and shock waves in the interstellar medium. These
high-density regions coincide with the locations of recent, large-scale star
formation in observations of some real colliding galaxies. Thus, combined
n-body/hydrodynamic computer simulations can be used to explore the history and
conditions of star forming regions in colliding galaxies. The galaxy system Arp
119 (CPG 29) contains a southern member, Arp 119S (Mrk 984), that has an
extremely disturbed appearance, and a northern member, Arp 119N, a gas-poor
elliptical. The morphology of both members can be fit well by a simulation in
which a gas-rich disk galaxy has been impacted by an equal mass elliptical that
had a trajectory approximately perpendicular to the plane of the disk and
passed through the disk slightly off-center. We compare multi-wavelength
observations of the Arp 119 system with a combined n-body/SPH simulation of
colliding galaxies. We find that the progression of recent, large-scale star
formation in this galaxy can be accounted for by a single, outwardly
propagating collision-induced density wave in the gas.

high-energy electrons arising from the neutralino annihilation in galaxy

We show that these electrons fit the population of seed relativistic electrons
postulated in many models for the origin of cluster radio halos. For magnetic
fields with central values $3 \div 30$ $\mu$G (depending on the DM profile),
the population of seed relativistic electrons from neutralino annihilation can
fit the radio halo spectra of Coma and 1E0657-56. The shape and the frequency
extension of the radio halo spectra are connected with the mass and physical
composition of the neutralino. A pure-gaugino neutralino with mass $M_{\chi}
\geq 80$ GeV can reasonably fit the spectra of both Coma and 1E0657-56. This
model provides a number of extra predictions that make it definitely testable.
On the one hand, it agrees with the observations that {\it (i)} the radio halo
is centered on the cluster dynamical center, usually coincident with the X-ray
center, {\it (ii)} the radio halo surface brightness is similar to the X-ray
one, and {\it (iii)} the monochromatic radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz correlates
strongly with the IC gas temperature. On the other hand, the model predicts
that radio halos should be present in every cluster, which is not actually
observed, although the predicted radio halo luminosities can change by a large
amount ($\sim 10^2 \div 10^6$), depending on the amplitude and the structure of
the IC magnetic field. Also, neutral pions arising from neutralino annihilation
should give rise to substantial gamma-ray emission that could be tested by the
next generation gamma-ray experiments.

to two constraints, and we find an analytic solution. Under the above
assumptions, this solution represents a state in which the ``entropy'' of a
microlensing ensemble is at its maximum, that is, the distribution of u_min
resembles a specific, theoretically expected, box-like distribution to the

exhibits characteristics of so-called `early-type' chemistry with high abundan-
ces of carbon-chain molecules such as HC3N, but it also has a large N2H+
abundance, which is expected only to build up at later stages. In contrast,
none of the carbon-chain molecules were detected in CrA C. CrA C has a higher
SO abundance than Cha-MMS1, which implies that it is chemically `older' than
Cha- MMS1. The most striking difference between the two cores is seen in the
HC3N/SO abundance ratio, which is at least three orders of magnitude higher in
Cha-MMS than in CrA C. This result is surprising since starless cores are
usually thought to be chemically younger than star-forming cores. Because of
the high N2H+ abundance, we suggest that Cha-MMS1 represents the `late-time
cyanopolyyne peak'. This would also be a more natural explanation for the
carbon-chain molecules than the `early-time' picture in view of the fact that
the core is presently collapsing to form a star. Thus, the dynamical evolution
in CrA C seems to have been very slow compared with that of Cha-MMS1, and we

steep increase in the proportion of S0 galaxies between clusters at high
redshifts and similar systems the present-day. It has been proposed that this
increase results from the transformation of the morphologies of accreted field
galaxies from spirals to S0s. We have simulated the evolution of the
morphological mix in clusters based on a simple phenomenological model where
the clusters accrete a mix of galaxies from the surrounding field, the spiral
galaxies are transformed to S0s (through an unspecified process) and are added
to the existing cluster population. We find that in order to reproduce the
apparently rapid increase in the ratio of S0 galaxies to ellipticals in the
clusters, our model requires that: (1) galaxy accretion rate has to be high
(typically, more than half of the present-day cluster population must have been
accreted since z~0.5), and (2) most of the accreted spirals, with morphological
types as late as Scdm, must have transformed to S0's. Although the latter
requirement may be difficult to meet, it is possible that such bulge-weak
spirals have already been `pre-processed' into the bulge-strong galaxies prior
to entering the cluster core and are eventually transformed into S0's in the
cluster environment. On the basis of the evolution of the general morphological
mix in clusters our model suggests that the process responsible for the
morphological transformation takes a relatively long time (1-3Gyr) after the
galaxy has entered the cluster environment.

At the moment there are no problems of fundamental nature in such linac
construction. The main problems have economic and technical aspects. Problems
of CW linac will be demonstrated on the base beam dynamics requirements. New

finite-dimensional code space in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a
system described by continuous quantum variables. These codes exploit the
noncommutative geometry of phase space to protect against errors that shift the
values of the canonical variables q and p. In the setting of quantum optics,
fault-tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed on the protected
code subspace using linear optical operations, squeezing, homodyne detection,
and photon counting; however, nonlinear mode coupling is required for the
preparation of the encoded states. Finite-dimensional versions of these codes
can be constructed that protect encoded quantum information against shifts in
the amplitude or phase of a d-state system. Continuous-variable codes can be
invoked to establish lower bounds on the quantum capacity of Gaussian quantum
channels.

schools, or lines of thought, that try to unify the apparently divergent laws
of dynamics and thermodynamics and to explain the observed time-asymmetry of
the universe, and most of its sub-systems, in spite of the fact that these
systems are driven by time-symmetric evolution equations. They will be called
the coarse-graining and the fine-graining schools (even if these names describe
only a part of their philosophy). Coarse-graining school obtains time-asymmetry
via a projection of the state space on a space of ''relevant'' states. The
corresponding projection of the primitive reversible evolution laws yields
effective irreversible evolution laws for the relevant states. Fine-graining
always use the same primitive reversible evolution laws. But these laws (in
adequate extensions of the usual spaces where these laws are formulated) have a
set of solutions $S$ that can be decompose in two subsets $S_{+\text{}}$ and
$S_{-}$ of time asymmetric solutions. Choosing one of these two sets, as the
arena to formulate the theory, time asymmetry is established. The aim of these
lectures is to explain, in the simplest- self-contained, unbiased, and, honest
way, the main characteristics of both schools and to point out the advantages
and disadvantages of both formalism, in such a way that, the polemic between
the schools, turns out to be explicit and organized in the mind of the reader
(who will be considered the supreme judge to give the final verdict).
