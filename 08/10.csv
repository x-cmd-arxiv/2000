distort its spectrum permanently. In this paper we discuss the distortion
caused by annihilations of relic particles. We use the observational bounds on
deviations from a Planck spectrum to constrain a combination of annihilation
cross section, mass, and abundance. For particles with (s-wave) annihilation
cross section, <\sigma|v|>=\sigma_0, the bound is
f[(\sigma_0/6e-27cm^3/s)(\Omega_{X\bar{X}}h^2)^2]/(m_X/MeV)<0.2, where m_X is
the particle mass, \Omega_{X\bar{X}} is the fraction of the critical density
the particle and its antiparticle contribute if they survive to the present
time, h=H_0/(100km/s/Mpc), H_0 is the Hubble constant, and f is the fraction of
the annihilation energy that interacts electromagnetically. We also compute the
less stringent limits for p-wave annihilation. We update other bounds on
residual annihilations and compare them to our CMB bound.

produced by Comptonization of the UV radiation reprocessed and rescattered in
the Broad Emission Line region. The main reason for this lies in the fact that
the jet encounters the ambient IR radiation over a relatively large distance as
compared to the distance where the energy density of the broad emission line
light peaks. In the soft - to mid energy X-ray band, the spectral component
resulting from Comptonization of the near-IR radiation joins smoothly with the

flux. At the highest observed gamma-ray energies, in the GeV range,
Comptonization of broad emission lines dominates over other components.

the simplest triaxial generalisation of the familiar isothermal sphere -- is
examined in detail. The velocity dispersions required to hold up the
self-consistent model are analytic. The velocity distribution of the dark
matter can be approximated as a triaxial Gaussian with semiaxes equal to the
velocity dispersions. There are roughly twenty experiments worldwide that are
searching for evidence of scarce interactions between weakly-interacting
massive-particle dark matter (WIMPs) and detector nuclei. The annual modulation
signal, caused by the Earth's rotation around the Sun, is a crucial
discriminant between WIMP events and the background. The greatest rate is in
June, the least in December. We compute the differential detection rate for
energy deposited by the rare WIMP-nucleus interactions in our logarithmic
ellipsoidal halo models. Triaxiality and velocity anisotropy change the total
rate by up to 40 %, and have a substantial effect on the amplitude of the
annual modulation signal. The overall rate is greatest, but the amplitude of
the modulation is weakest, in our radially anisotropic halo models. Even the
sign of the signal can be changed. Restricting attention to low energy events,
the models predict that the maximum rate occurs in December, and not in June.

with the Tibet air shower array, we examined the shadowing of cosmic rays by

just in the apparent direction of the Sun, though it was observed at the
position considerably away from the Sun to the south-west in the period between
1990 and 1993. It is known that the magnetic pole of equivalent solar dipole
was reversed during the previous active phase, and near solar minimum the
dipole was aligned with the rotating axis, preserving its N-pole on the north
pole side of the Sun. This causes the solar magnetic field to shift the Sun's
shadow to the east. Thus, the observed results suggest that the shift of the
Sun's shadow due to the solar magnetic field was pushed back by the effect of
the geomagnetic field, since the geomagnetic field always make the shadow shift
to the west. We discuss the Sun's shadow observed during the period near solar

K-band luminosity in this region and compare these with grids of stellar
population models. We find that the locus of the colours of the stellar
populations in the luminous (>0.5L*) early-type galaxies, both ellipticals and
S0s, traces a sequence of varying metallicity at a single age. At fainter
luminosities (<0.1L*), this sequence is extended to lower metallicities by the
morphologically-classified ellipticals. However, the faintest S0s exhibit very
different behaviour, showing a wide range in colours, including a large
fraction (30%) with relatively blue colours which appear to have younger
luminosity-weighted ages for their stellar populations, 2-5Gyrs. We show that
the proportion of these young S0s in the cluster population is consistent with
the observed decrease in the S0 population seen in distant clusters when
interpreted within the framework of a two-step spectroscopic and morphological
transformation of accreted spiral field galaxies into cluster S0s.

purely empirical method to detect, and subsequently classify, cluster galaxies
at all redshifts smaller than 0.8. Interlopers are discarded with unprecedented
efficiency (up to 100%). The first Principal Component essentially reproduces

formation history of cluster members. The (PC2, PC3) plane allows us to
identify Seyfert galaxies (and distinguish them from starbursts) based on
photometric colors alone. In the case of E/S0 galaxies with known redshift, we
are able to resolve the age-dust- metallicity degeneracy, albeit at the
accuracy limit of our present observations. This technique will allow us to
probe galaxy clusters well beyond their cores and to fainter magnitudes than
spectroscopy can achieve. We are able to directly compare these data over the

the intrinsic electronic nature of the underlying spins. The strenght of these
interactions depend strongly on the orientation of the field, a feature which
can be exploited to detect chiral effects experimentally. In many spin systems,
these chiral interactions are generated and should be taken into account before
any comparison with experiments can be made. We study the effect of the chiral
interactions on certain quasi-one-dimensional gapped spin half systems and show
that they can potentially alter the physics expected from the Pauli coupling
alone. In particular, we demonstrate that these terms alter the universality
class of the C-IC transition in spin-tubes. More interestingly, in weakly
coupled XX zig-zag ladders, we find that the field induced chiral term can
close the singlet gap and drive a second order transition in the non-magnetic
singlet sector, which manifests itself as a two component Luttinger liquid-like
behaviour in the spin correlation functions. Finally, we discuss the relevance
of our results to experiments.

effect of frustration and dimerization of a Heisenberg system with alternating
spins $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The combined
effect most visibly appears in the elementary excitation spectra. In contrast
to the ground state energy that decreases with dimerization and increases with
frustration, the excitation energies are shown to be suppressed in energy by
both dimerization and frustration. The threshold value of frustration that
signals a transition from a classical ferrimagnetic state to a spiral state,
decreases with dimerization, showing that dimerization further helps in the
phase transition. The correlation length and sublattice magnetization decrease
with both dimerization and frustration indicating the destruction of the
long-range classical ferrimagnetic. The linear spin wave theory shows that in
the case of a square lattice, dimerization initially opposes the
frustration-led transition to a spiral magnetic state, but then higher
magnitudes of lattice deformation facilitate the transition. It also shows that
the transition to spiral state is inhibited in a square lattice beyond a
certain value of dimerization.

shoulder in the Schottky-like peak, or emergence of a second peak when an

wave-spin wave interactions are ignored in a ferrimagnet, the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic elementary excitation spectra give rise to two independent
heat capacity peaks, one enveloped by the other, which add up to give the peak
for the total system. Taking this into account helps understand the additional
structures in the peaks. Moreover, the classification of ferrimagnets into
predominantly antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, or a mixture of the two is
shown to be validated by studying them under additional influences like
dimerization and frustration. Because these two are shown to influence the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dispersion relations - and hence the
quantities like heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility - by different
amounts, the characterisation of ferrimagnetic systems ($1,1/2$), ($3/2,1$) and
