presented, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Apart from the spectral index,
the parameters are the Hubble parameter, the total matter density and the
baryon density. The data points are intended to represent all measurements
which are likely to significantly affect the result. The cosmic microwave
anisotropy is represented by the COBE normalization, and heights of the first
and second peaks given by the latest Boomerang and Maxima data. The slope of
the galaxy correlation function and the matter density contrast on the
$8h^{-1}\Mpc$ scale are each represented by a data point, as are the expected
values of the Hubble parameter and matter density.
  The `low-deuterium' nucleosynthesis value of the baryon density provides a
final data point, the fit giving a value about one standard deviation higher.
The reionization epoch is calculated from the model by assuming that it
corresponds to the collapse of a fraction $f\gsim 10^{-4}$ of matter.
  We consider the case of a scale-independent spectral index, and also the
scale-dependent spectral index predicted by running mass models of inflation.
In the former case, the result is compared with the prediction of models of
inflation based on effective field theory, in which the field value is small on
the Planck scale. Detailed comparison is made with other fits, and other
approaches to the comparison with theory.

electric vectors of optical polarization in the active galactic nuclei is
well-known. However, the origin of the polarization and reason behind its
correlation with radio morphology is not yet established. From accurate
spectropolarimetry of 7 quasars which show this alignment effect, we find that
the polarization is universally confined to the continuum, and not shared by
the line emission or 3000A bump. Over the observed region 4000-8000A, the
spectral indices of polarized flux, P x Flambda, are consistent with uniform
polarization applied to the light of the big blue bump or with synchrotron
emission. However, electron scattering from an optically-thick, geometrically-
thin, accretion disk is well-known to give rise to a polarization position
angle that is perpendicular to the disk axis. Optical synchrotron emission akin
to that shown to exist in the miniblazar 3C273 is a more attractive
explanation, and supporting evidence can be found for some of the targets in
the form of polarimetric variability over intervals of years. Properties of the
most strongly-polarized radio-optical aligned quasars can be explained by
misdirected blazar core components that have net polarizations of P~10% and
provide ~10% of the total optical light.

astrophysical problems without specific adaptations: in any axially symmetric
source model and for all atoms or molecules for which collisional rate
coefficients are available. Continuum emission and absorption by dust is
explicitly taken into account but scattering is neglected. We illustrate these

example, we find no obvious break in the optical light curve during the
relativistic phase itself. But an obvious break does exist at the transition
from the relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase, which typically
occurs at time 10 to 30 days. It is very interesting that the break is affected
by many parameters, such as the electron energy fraction, $\xi_{\rm e}$, the
magnetic energy fraction, $\xi_{\rm B}^2$, the initial opening angle of the
jet,$\theta_0$, and the medium density, $n$. We also find that afterglows from

limb-brightened, kiloparsec-scale conical outflow from the central starburst
region. The outflow is very similar in morphology to the known H-alpha outflow
cone, on scales down to <= 20 pc. This provides, for the first time, robust
evidence that both X-ray and H-alpha emission come from low volume filling
factor regions of interaction between the fast energetic wind of SN-ejecta and
the denser ambient interstellar medium (ISM), and not from the wind fluid
itself. We provide estimates of the (observationally and theoretically
important) filling factor of the X-ray emitting gas, of between 4 and 40 per
cent, consistent with an upper limit of ~40 per cent based directly on the
observed limb-brightened morphology of the outflow. Only <= 20 per cent of the
observed X-ray emission can come from the volume-filling, metal-enriched, wind
fluid itself. Spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the soft diffuse thermal X-ray
emission reveals that the predominant source of spectral variation along the
outflow cones is due to strong variation in the absorption, on scales of < 60
pc, there being little change in the characteristic temperature of the
emission. We show that these observations are easily explained by, and fully
consistent with, the standard model of a superwind driven by a starburst of NGC
253's observed power. If these results are typical of all starburst-driven
winds, then we do not directly see all the energy and gas (in particular the
hot metal-enriched gas) transported out of galaxies by superwinds, even in

study of commensurate/incommensurate transitions to deduce the physics of
coupled Luttinger liquids. For those intrachain interaction strengths for which
interchain tunneling is relevant, we find that it can lead to the formation of
symmetric and antisymmetric bands with split Fermi surfaces, depending on the
relative strengths of interchain tunneling and interchain interactions. With
split Fermi surfaces, the tunneling is coherent. It is not possible to have two
gapless Fermi surfaces with the same Fermi momentum when interchain tunneling
is relevant. However, interchain interactions can drive the formation of a gap,
in which case interchain transport will be incoherent. We comment on the
possible relevance of our results to c-axis transport in high-T_c

$\alpha_s^3$ for the determination of the bottom MSbar mass. For the bottom 1S
mass, which is extracted from the $\Upsilon$ sum rules directly, we obtain
$M_b^{1S}=4.69\pm 0.03$ GeV with negligible correlation to the value of the
strong coupling. For the bottom MSbar mass we obtain $\bar M_b(\bar M_b) =
4.17\pm 0.05$ GeV taking $\alpha_s^{(n_l=5)}(M_Z)=0.118\pm 0.003$ as an input.
Compared with an analysis where all quarks lighter than the bottom are treated
as massless, we find that the finite charm mass shifts the bottom 1S mass,
$M_b^{1S}$, by about -20 MeV and the MSbar mass, $\bar M_b(\bar M_b)$, by -30
to -35 MeV.

not obey the exclusion principle bound, we show that there are finite action

suggest that this is consistent with the proposal that there is an effective
description in terms of supergravity defined on noncommutative spaces and
noncommutativity arises here because of imposing supersymmetry.

light-cone quantization. First I explain how to choose a time in special
relativity. Inclusion of Poincare invariance naturally leads to Dirac's forms
of relativistic dynamics. Among these, the front form, being the basis for
light-cone quantization, is my main focus. I explain a few of its peculiar
features such as boost and Galilei invariance or separation of relative and
center-of-mass motion. Combining light-cone dynamics and field quantization
results in light-cone quantum field theory. As the latter represents a
first-order system, quantization is somewhat nonstandard. I address this issue
using Schwinger's quantum action principle, the method of Faddeev and Jackiw,
and the functional Schroedinger picture. A finite-volume formulation,
discretized light-cone quantization, is analysed in detail. I point out some
problems with causality, which are absent in infinite volume. Finally, the
triviality of the light-cone vacuum is established. Coming to applications, I
introduce the notion of light-cone wave functions as the solutions of the
light-cone Schroedinger equation. I discuss some examples, among them
nonrelativistic Coulomb systems and model field theories in two dimensions.
Vacuum properties (like chiral condensates) are reconstructed from the particle
spectrum obtained by solving the light-cone Schroedinger equation. In a last
application, I make contact with phenomenology by calculating the pion wave
function within the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model. I am thus able to predict a
number of observables like the pion charge and core radius, the r.m.s.
transverse momentum, the pion structure function and the pion distribution
amplitude. The latter turns out to be the asymptotic one.

condition needs to be imposed to guarantee the global existence of a line
bundle on a coset space. The results are applied to the explicit construction
of sigma-models on cosets SO(2N)/U(N). Only a finite number of these models can
consistently incorporate matter in representations descending from the
spinorial representations of SO(2N). We investigate in detail some aspects of
the vacuum structure of the gauged SO(10)/U(5) theory, with surprising results:
the fully gauged minimal anomaly-free model is shown be singular, as the
kinetic terms of the quasi-Goldstone fermions vanish in the vacuum. Gauging
only the linear isometry group SU(5)xU(1), or one of its subgroups, can give a

making the beam injection to the damping ring unstable. Because the unstable
beam generates also large amount of the radiation, the beam current is limited
by the KEK radiation safety policy much lower than what we expect. Stabilizing
the S-band linac is therefore important not only to improve the beam quality,
but also to clear the radiation safety limit to start the multi-bunch
operation.
  We have made various modifications to solve the problem on the electron gun,
modulator, klystron etc. For the modulator, we have developed a feed-forward
controlled De-Q module. This module compensates the voltage jitter by
controlling the deQ timing with a feed-forward circuit because the amount of
the excessive charge up is strongly correlated to the charge up slope that can
be measured prior to the deQ timing. The energy stability was examined and was
improved by a factor of 3, from 0.6% to 0.2% of itself. Modification for the
feed-forward circuit to get more stability was made. The test for the new
circuit is in progress. For the long term instability, phase-lock system for
klystron RF is being installed. In the test operation, it showed a good
performance and compensate the phase drift less than 1 deg.
