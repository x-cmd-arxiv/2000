P(k) that accelerates CMBfast by a factor around 10^3 without appreciable loss
of accuracy, then apply it to constrain 11 cosmological parameters from current
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) data. While
the CMB alone still suffers from several degeneracies, allowing, e.g., closed
models with strong tilt and tensor contributions, the shape of the real space
power spectrum of galaxies from the IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift (PSCz)
survey breaks these degeneracies and helps place strong constraints on most
parameters. At 95% confidence, the combined CMB and LSS data imply a baryon
density 0.020 < omega_b < 0.037, dark matter density 0.10 < omega_d < 0.32 with
a neutrino fraction f_nu < 38%, vacuum density Omega_Lambda < 0.76, curvature
-0.19 < Omega_k < 0.10, scalar tilt 0.86 < n_s < 1.16 and reionization optical
depth tau < 0.44. These joint constraints are quite robust, changing little
when we impose priors on the Hubble parameter, tilt, flatness, gravity waves or
reionization. Adding nucleosynthesis and neutrino priors on the other hand
tightens parameters considerably, requiring Omega_Lambda > 0.49 and a red-tilt.
  The analysis allows a number of consistency tests to be made, all of which
pass. At the 95% level, the flat scalar ``concordance model'' with
Omega_Lambda=0.62, omega_d=0.13, omega_b=0.02, f_nu~0, n_s=0.9, tau=0.1, h=0.63
is consistent with external constraints. The inferred PSCz bias b~1.2 agrees
with the value estimated independently from redshift space distortions. The
inferred cosmological constant value agrees with the one independently derived
from SN 1a studies. Cosmology seems to be on the right track.

in Statistics for some time but has not been implemented because of the large

density estimation based on multi-resolutional KD-trees which makes this
statistical technique into a computationally tractable problem. We provide the
theoretical and experimental background for using a mixture model of Gaussians
based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm. Applying these analyses
to simulated data sets we show that the EM algorithm - using the AIC penalized
likelihood to score the fit - out-performs the best kernel density estimate of
the distribution while requiring no ``fine--tuning'' of the input algorithm
parameters. We find that EM can accurately recover the underlying density
distribution from point processes thus providing an efficient adaptive
smoothing method for astronomical source catalogs. To demonstrate the general
application of this statistic to astrophysical problems we consider two cases
of density estimation: the clustering of galaxies in redshift space and the
clustering of stars in color space. From these data we show that EM provides an
adaptive smoothing of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space
(describing accurately both the small and large-scale features within the data)
and a means of identifying outliers in multi-dimensional color-color space
(e.g. for the identification of high redshift QSOs). Automated tools such as
those based on the EM algorithm will be needed in the analysis of the next
generation of astronomical catalogs (2MASS, FIRST, PLANCK, SDSS) and ultimately
in in the development of the National Virtual Observatory.

relative orientation of the 2d crystal and the periodic potential troughs,
which select a set of Bragg planes running parallel to the troughs, and the

several of their exciting initial applications. However, a stiff entry fee
exists at the threshold to this new domain: new engineering is crucial to
realizing the full potential of NEMS. Certain mainstays in the methodology of

for: ultrasensitive, very high bandwidth displacement transducers; an

radius, which is finite, depends neither on the gauge-fixing parameter nor on
the gauge-fixing scheme employed, and is process-independent. This definition
stems solely from an effective proper photon-neutrino one-loop vertex, with no
reference to box or self-energy contributions. The role of the $WW$ box in this
construction is critically examined. In particular it is shown that the
exclusion of the effective WW box from the definition of the neutrino charge
radius is not a matter of convention but is in fact dynamically realized when
the target-fermions are right-handedly polarized. In this way we obtain a
unique decomposition of effective self-energies, vertices, and boxes, which
separately respect electroweak gauge invariance. We elaborate on the tree-level
origin of the mechanism which enforces at one-loop level massive cancellations
among the longitudinal momenta appearing in the Feynman diagrams, and in
particular those associated with the non-abelian character of the theory.

counting in a simplified EFT containing only nucleons. For weak scattering at
low energy, we find a natural expansion of the scattering matrix around the
unique trivial fixed point of the RG. For strong scattering at low energy, the
calculation can be organised in a useful and systematic way by expanding the
potential around a non-trivial fixed point corresponding to a bound state of
two nucleons at threshold. The resulting expansion of the inverse of the
scattering matrix reproduces the effective range expansion order by order.
  The extension of this EFT to include pions in a manner consistent with chiral
symmetry is discussed. By considering a modified effective range expansion, we
find that the small momentum expansion in S-wave scattering converges slowly,
if at all. The NN potential is written down to third order in small momenta.
With a cut-off in coordinate space, we calculate phase shifts in peripheral
partial waves for which the EFT predictions are parameter-free, and for which

is a sensitive and unique measure for precision tests of physics beyond the
Standard Model. In this work we summarize recent results on the expected
precision of the partial $\Gamma (H \to \gamma \gamma)$ width at the $\gamma
\gamma$ option of a future linear collider. Heavy particles do not decouple in
general and differences between the SM and MSSM predictions or 2HD-models can
differ in the percentile regime. Large non-Sudakov DL corrections need to be
resummed and consistency requirements demand the use of the Sterman-Weinberg
jet definition in order to avoid additional DL terms from three jet final
states. We find that the well understood background process $\gamma \gamma \to
q \bar{q}$ allows for a ${\mathcal O}$(2%) determination of $\Gamma (H \to
\gamma \gamma)$ using conservative collider parameters. Recent improvements in
the expected $\gamma \gamma$ luminosity suggest that the precision for the
diphoton partial Higgs width can be further improved and is dominated by the
error in BR($H \to b \bar{b}$) from the $e^\pm$ mode, which is presently
estimated to be in the one percent regime.

negative and no direct connection arises, it is discussed how higher spin
fields could be found among general external fields if one relaxes somehow the
equivalence principle. Besides, the particle action in general backgrounds is
shown to reproduce the De Wit-Freedman point particle -- symmetric tensors

eigenvalues where $\Omega^{\star}$, the symmetric rearrangement of $\Omega$ in
$\SS^n$, is a geodesic ball in $\SS^n$ having the same $n$-volume as $\Omega$.
We also show that $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$ for geodesic balls of geodesic radius
$\theta_1$ less than or equal to $\pi/2$ is an increasing function of
$\theta_1$ which runs between the value $(j_{n/2,1}/j_{n/2-1,1})^2$ for
$\theta_1=0$ (this is the Euclidean value) and $2(n+1)/n$ for $\theta_1=\pi/2$.
Here $j_{\nu,k}$ denotes the $k^{th}$ positive zero of the Bessel function
$J_{\nu}(t)$. This result generalizes the Payne-P\'{o}lya-Weinberger
conjecture, which applies to bounded domains in Euclidean space and which we
had proved earlier. Our method makes use of symmetric rearrangement of
functions and various technical properties of special functions. We also prove
that among all domains contained in a hemisphere of $\SS^n$ and having a fixed
value of $\lambda_1$ the one with the maximal value of $\lambda_2$ is the
geodesic ball of the appropriate radius. This is a stronger, but slightly less
accessible, isoperimetric result than that for $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$. Various
other results for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ of geodesic balls in $\SS^n$ are
proved in the course of our work.

hybrid quantum computer that operates on both continuous and discrete quantum
variables. Such hybrid computers are shown to be more efficient than
conventional quantum computers for performing a variety of quantum algorithms,
such as computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

A 63, 052311 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevA.63.052311",,"quant-ph",,"  A continuous key distribution scheme is proposed that relies on a pair of
canonically conjugate quantum variables. It allows two remote parties to share
a secret Gaussian key by encoding it into one of the two quadrature components
of a single-mode electromagnetic field. The resulting quantum cryptographic
information vs disturbance tradeoff is investigated for an individual attack
based on the optimal continuous cloning machine. It is shown that the
information gained by the eavesdropper then simply equals the information lost
by the receiver.

combinatorial objects like Hadamard matrices and weighing matrices to device
new quantum algorithms. We show how the properties of a weighing matrix can be
used to construct a problem for which the quantum query complexity is
ignificantly lower than the classical one. It is pointed out that this scheme
captures both Bernstein & Vazirani's inner-product protocol, as well as
Grover's search algorithm.
  In the second part of the article we consider Paley's construction of
Hadamard matrices, which relies on the properties of quadratic characters over
finite fields. We design a query problem that uses the Legendre symbol chi
(which indicates if an element of a finite field F_q is a quadratic residue or
not). It is shown how for a shifted Legendre function f_s(i)=chi(i+s), the
unknown s in F_q can be obtained exactly with only two quantum calls to f_s.
This is in sharp contrast with the observation that any classical,
probabilistic procedure requires more than log(q) + log((1-e)/2) queries to
solve the same problem.
