one of key problems to be solved for explanation of the observed large-scale
homogeneity of the Universe. The previous attempts to get around this obstacle
led to imposing severe observational constraints on the parameters of the
fields involved. Aim of the present report is to show that yet another way to
overcome the above problem is accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
effect. Namely, if the scalar (Higgs) field was presented by a single coherent
quantum state at the initial instant of time, then its reduction during a phase
transition at some later instant should be correlated even at distances
exceeding the local cosmological horizon. Consideration of a simplest
one-dimensional cosmological model with Z_2 Higgs field demonstrates that EPR
correlations can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation
of the domain walls, and such effect seems to be even more promising in the
cases of two- and three-dimensional geometry.

a parameterized sink term in the equation of continuity. Parameters that give
the best fits to the X-ray observations of NGC 4472 are used as a template for
the radial distribution of interstellar cooling in structurally homologous
elliptical galaxies of lower mass. Gas that cools within an effective radius
can contribute an additional 10 - 30 percent to the mass of the old stellar
population. If the cooled gas forms into stars of very low mass, $\ll
M_{\odot}$, as is commonly assumed, the cooled mass is optically dark. As a
result, the mass to light ratios determined from stellar velocities
systematically overestimate that of the old stellar population. Moreover, the
total mass and spatial distribution of the optically dark young stellar
population does not scale homologously with galactic luminosity or radius and
the total stellar mass to light ratio varies with galactic radius. We
investigate the non-homologous perturbations of cooled gas on the mass to light
ratio for several idealized homologous elliptical galaxies and show that they
appear to be incompatible with the observed thinness of the fundamental plane.
If optically luminous young stars formed from the cooled gas, the disturbance
of the fundamental plane would be lessened.

dependence, with chi_{perp} for H{perp}c larger than chi_{parallel} for
H{parallel}c. For both field orientations, chi does not follow the Curie-Weiss
behavior due to the small energy gap of the J = 7/2 multiplet above the J = 5/2
ground-state multiplet. However, with increasing temperature, chi_{parallel}(T)
exhibits a broad minimum near 100 K and then a slow increase while
chi_{perp}(T) shows a monotonic decrease. A sharp peak in C_p(T) at 4.7 K
manifests an antiferromagnetic ordering. The electronic contribution, gamma, to
C_p(T) is estimated to be gamma = 103.2 (7) mJ/moleSmK^2. The entropy
associated with the magnetic ordering is much smaller than Rln2, where R is the
gas constant, which is usually expected for the doublet ground state of
Sm^{+3}. The unusual magnetic and electronic properties evident in M(T) and

electrons and localized electrons at Sm^{+3} sites.

that the diagonal links are strongly and systematically correlated with the

compare the number of diagonal links in the symbolic creation story with a folk
tale, which ostensibly narrates the same overt succession of events (but
without pretensions of encrypting additional meanings). We find that the

macroscopic meaning and novelty in complex systems.

fluctuations are much stronger for the harmonic pumping than in the case of the
noise ac field of the same intensity. The reduction factor $r$ in a static
magnetic field takes the universal value of 2 only for the white--noise
pumping. For the strictly harmonic pumping $A(t)=A_{0}\cos\omega t$ of
sufficiently large intensity the variance is almost insensitive to the static

gravity expectations. This analyses is generalized to the case of charged black
holes. Then we consider black holes embedded in String/M-theory as bound states

existing linacs were not designed to meet. Moreover, the need for specialized

modification and upgrade of conventional linacs. Improvements have been made to
the Advanced Photon Source (APS) injector linac in order to produce and
characterize high-brightness beams. Specifically, effort has been directed at
generating beams suitable for use in the low-energy undulator test line (LEUTL)
