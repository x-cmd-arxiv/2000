host of giant radio galaxy MRC B0319-454. From near-infrared colours, the
active nucleus is shown to be reddened by hot dust emission or dust extinction.
Star forming regions are identified beyond a radius of 5"" (8.1 kpc) where hot
gas is prevalent. The optical spectrum shows gas rotation at speeds of up to
350km/s out to >=32kpc along the radio axis. A model is proposed in which the
giant elliptical is triaxial with the radio axis along the short axis, and the
figure rotation is around the long axis. From the model, the angles of the
principal axes are psi=34 degrees, theta=65 degrees, and phi=19 degrees with
axis ratios of B/A=0.75 and C/A=0.69. A second velocity feature from 5"" to 15""
to the north-east of the nucleus is proposed to be a merging gas-rich galaxy
inducing star formation while settling into an orbit about the figure rotation
axis.

  points in astrophysics"", Dubna, August 22-26, 2000",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this article we briefly review our recent results on evolution and
properties of isolated neutron stars (INSs) in the Galaxy.
  As the first step we calculate a {\it census} of INSs in our Galaxy.
  We infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity of NSs, $ <V> \sim
$(200-300) ${\rm km s^{-1}}$. The same conclusion is reached for both a
constant magnetic field ($B\sim 10^{12}$ G) and for a magnetic field decaying
exponentially with a timescale $\sim 10^9$ yr. These results, moreover,
constrain the fraction of low velocity stars, which could have escaped pulsar
statistics, to $\sim$few percents.
  Then we show that the range of minimum value of magnetic moment, $\mu_b$:
$\sim 10^{29.5}\ge \mu_b \ge 10^{28} {\rm G} {\rm cm}^3$, and the
characteristic decay time, $t_d$: $\sim 10^8\ge t_d \ge 10^7 {\rm yrs}$, can be
excluded assuming the standard initial magnetic momentum, $\mu_0=10^{30} {\rm
G} {\rm cm}^3$, if accreting INSs are observed. For these parameters an INS
would never reach the stage of accretion from the interstellar medium even for
a low space velocity of the star and high density of the ambient plasma. The
range of excluded parameters increases for lower values of $\mu_0$.
  It is shown that old accreting INSs become more abundant than young cooling
INSs at X-ray fluxes below $\sim 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We can
predict that about one accreting INS per square degree should be observed at
the {\it Chandra} and {\it Newton} flux limits of $\sim 10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}.$ The weak {\it ROSAT} sources, associated with INSs, can be young
cooling objects, if the NSs birth rate in the solar vicinity during the last
$\sim 10^6$ yr was much higher than inferred from radiopulsar observations.

distortions and had galactic coordinates superimposed on it to permit accurate
correlations with the most recent H{\sc i} (21 cm), X-ray (0.75 kev) and FIR
(IRAS 100 $\mu$m) maps.
  Furthermore, an upper limit of 0.13 arcsec/yr to the expansion proper motion
of the primary 25\degree long nebulous arc has been obtained by comparing a
recent \ha image obtained with the San Pedro Martir telescope of its
filamentary edge with that on a POSS E plate obtained in 1951.
  It is concluded that these filamentary arcs are the superimposed images of
separate shells (driven by supernova explosions and/or stellar winds) rather
than the edges of a single `superbubble' stretching from Barnard's Arc (and the
Orion Nebula) to these high galactic latitudes. The proper motion measurement
argues against the primary \ha emitting arc being associated with the giant

bosons in the Standard Model (SM) and the minimal supersymmetric extension
(MSSM), which can be investigated at the LHC and $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. The
final goal is the reconstruction of the Higgs potential and thus the
verification of the Higgs mechanism. MSSM Higgs boson production processes at
future $\gamma\gamma$ colliders are calculated in several decay channels. Heavy
scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons can be discovered in the $b\bar{b}$ final
state in the investigated mass range 200 to 800 GeV for moderate and large
values of $\tan\beta$. The $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel provides a heavy Higgs boson
discovery potential for large values of $\tan\beta$. Several mechanisms that
can be exploited at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders for the measurement of the
lifetime of a SM Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range are analysed. In
the $WW$ mode, the lifetime of Higgs scalars with masses below $\sim 160$ GeV
can be determined with an error less than 10%. The reconstruction of the Higgs
potential requires the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings. The SM and MSSM
trilinear Higgs self-couplings are accessible in double and triple Higgs
production. A theoretical analysis is presented in the relevant channels at the
LHC and $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. For high luminosities, the SM trilinear
Higgs self-coupling can be measured with an accuracy of 20% at a 500 GeV
$e^+e^-$ linear collider. The MSSM coupling among three light Higgs bosons has
to be extracted from continuum production. The other trilinear Higgs couplings
are measurable in a restricted range of the MSSM parameter space. At the LHC,
the $Hhh$ coupling can be probed in resonant decays.

and are likely to cause thermal inflation leading to a well-defined cosmology.
They can solve the $\mu$ problem, and generate viable neutrino masses.
Canonical flaton models predict an axion decay constant F_a of order 10^{10}
GeV and generic flaton models give F_a of order 10^9 GeV as required by
observation. The axion is a good candidate for cold dark matter in all cases,
because its density is diluted by flaton decay if F_a is bigger than 10^{12}
GeV. In addition to the dark matter axions, a population of relativistic axions
is produced by flaton decay, which at nucleosynthesis is equivalent to some
number \delta N_\nu of extra neutrino species. Focussing on the canonical
model, containing three flaton particles and two flatinos, we evaluate all of
the flaton-flatino-axion interactions and the corresponding axionic decay
rates. They are compared with the dominant hadronic decay rates, for both DFSZ
and KSVZ models. These formulas provide the basis for a precise calculation of
the equivalent \delta N_\nu in terms of the parameters (masses and couplings).
The KSVZ case is probably already ruled out by the existing bound \delta
N_\nu\lsim 1. The DFSZ case is allowed in a significant region of parameter
space, and will provide a possible explanation for any future detection of
nonzero $\delta N_\nu$.

Pontryagin-Thom construction. B.J. Sanderson computed the bordism group of 3
component surface-links using the Hilton-Milnor Theorem, and later gave a
geometric interpretation of the groups in terms of intersections of Seifert
hypersurfaces and their framings. In this paper, we geometrically represent
every element of the bordism group uniquely by a certain standard form of a
surface-link, a generalization of a Hopf link. The standard forms give rise to
an inverse of Sanderson's geometrically defined invariant.

investigate the size distribution of businesses. In the model, businesses are
constrained to comply with the market price, as expected by the customers,
while customers can only buy at the prices offered by the businesses. We show
numerically and analytically that the size distribution scales like a
power-law. A mean-field version of our model is also introduced and we
determine for which value of the parameters the mean-field model agrees with
the microscopic model. We discuss to what extent our simple model and its
results compare with empirical data on company sizes in the U.S. and debt sizes
in Japan. Finally, possible extensions of the mean-field model are discussed,
to cope with other empirical data.

Coulomb dissociation of $^8$B at beam energies below and around 50 MeV/nucleon.
The theory has been formulated within a first order semiclassical scheme of
Coulomb excitation, in which both the ground state and the continuum state wave
functions of $^8$B enter as inputs. We find that the magnitude of the
interference could be large in some cases. However, there are some specific
observables which are free from the effects of the $E1 - E2$ interference,
which is independent of the models used to describe the structure of $^8$B.
This will be useful for the analysis of the breakup data in relation to the
extraction of the astrophysical factor $S_{17}(0)$.

search. Particularly, we propose some experiments with the hyperfine structure
of hydrogen, deuterium and ytterbium-171 and of some atoms with a small
magnetic moment. Other suggestions are for some measurements of the fine
structure associated with the ground state. Special attention is paid to the
interpretation of the hfs measurements in terms of variations of the

being constructed for a nominal beam current of 3.5 A and 1.5 microsecond pulse
length. The high current requires highly effective suppression of dipolar
wakes. Two concepts are investigated for the accelerating structure design: the
""Tapered Damped Structure"" developed for the CLIC main beam, and the ""Slotted

effective higher-order mode damping. A full-size prototype of the TDS structure
has been built and tested successfully at full power. A first prototype of the
