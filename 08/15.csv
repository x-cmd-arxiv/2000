galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) has been carried out using UBV CCD images from the prime
focus camera on the Lick 3 meter Shane telescope. The YMC population is found
to be quite rich with a specific U-band luminosity T_L(U) = 1.4, consistent
with the high current star formation rate of this galaxy. The brightest
clusters have M_V about -12.5, far brighter than any young clusters currently
known in the Milky Way and even surpassing the luminosity of the R136 cluster
in the 30 Dor complex in the Large Magellanic Cloud. A few of the YMCs are
examined on archive HST/WFPC2 images, confirming their cluster nature and
providing estimates of their effective radii of 2-3 pc. The number of YMCs in
M51 is compatible with extrapolation of a power-law luminosity function with
exponent roughly equal to -2 from a Milky Way-like population of open clusters.
Both the SFR and T_L(U) of M51 are similar to those of other cluster-rich
spiral galaxies like NGC 1313 and M83.

the correlations of individual galaxies at the level predicted from n-body
calibrated halo clustering.
  The groups are stacked in velocity and position to create a sample large
enough for measurement of a density and velocity dispersion profile. The
stacked mean galaxy density profile falls nearly as a power law with r^{-2.5}
and has no well-defined core. The projected velocity dispersion is examined for
a variety of samples with different methods and found to be either flat or
slowly rising outwards. The combination of a steeper-than-isothermal density
profile and the outward rising velocity dispersion implies that the
mass-to-light ratio of groups rises with radius. The M/L can be kept nearly
constant if the galaxy orbits are nearly circular, although such strong
tangential anisotropy is not supported by other evidence. The segregation of
mass and light is not dependent on galaxy luminosity but is far more prominent
in the red galaxies than the blue. The M/L gradient could arise from orbital
``sloshing'' of the galaxies in the group halos, dynamical friction acting on
the galaxies in a background of ``classical'' collisionless dark matter, or,
more speculatively, the dark matter may have a true core.

be <= 1.5 times the bar semi-major axis. These results contradict some recent
claimed ``universal'' galaxy disk/halo relations, since NGC 4123 is of modest
size (rotation curve maximum 145 km/sec, and V_flat = 130 km/sec) yet is quite
disk-dominated. The dark halo of NGC 4123 is less concentrated than favored by
current models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. Since some 30%
of bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicating

understanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular those
undergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. Indeed, our merged

correlated with the distance of the contacting aminoacids along the sequence.
Thus $\alpha$-helices get established first. Crambin is found to behave like a

and has antiferromagnetic(AF) order below 15 K, that is evidenced by
antiferromagnetic resonance(AFMR). For the understanding of the rich physics of
fullerides it is important to identify the different ground states. ESR has
proven to be a useful technique for this purpose. However, since it is a very
sensitive probe, it can detect a multitude of spin species and it is not
straightforward to identify their origin, especially in a system like

and quantum canonical general relativity. The perturbative technique appears to
preserve many of the attractive features of the non-perturbative quantization
approach based on Ashtekar's new variables and spin networks. With this
approach one can find perturbatively classical observables (quantities that
have vanishing Poisson brackets with the constraints) and quantum states
(states that are annihilated by the quantum constraints). The relative ease
with which the technique appears to deal with these traditionally hard problems
opens several questions about how relevant the results produced can possibly
be. Among the questions is the issue of how useful are results for large values
of the cosmological constant and how the approach can deal with several
pathologies that are expected to be present in the canonical approach to
quantum gravity. With the aim of clarifying these points, and to make our
construction as explicit as possible, we study its application in several
simple models. We consider Bianchi cosmologies, the asymmetric top, the coupled
harmonic oscillators with constant energy density and a simple quantum
mechanical system with two Hamiltonian constraints. We find that the technique
satisfactorily deals with the pathologies of these models and offers promise
for finding (at least some) results even for small values of the cosmological
constant. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method would operate in the full
four dimensional quantum general relativity case.

We show how our expressions can be used to calculate and discuss phase shifts

relativistic framework, including spin-gravitation terms: gravitational red

Lense-Thirring effects, de Sitter geodetic precession and finally the effect of

(PQ) symmetry as well as the generation of the $\mu$ term. The flaton fields
which break PQ symmetry are accompanied by flatinos, and the lightest flatino
(the LSP) can be the stable, while the decay of the lightest neutralino (the
NLSP) might be visible at colliders with a low axion scale. We examine the
cosmology of these models, involving thermal inflation just after the PQ phase
transition. The branching ratio of flatons into axions must be small so as not
to interfere with nucleosynthesis, and flatons must not decay into the LSP or
it will be over-abundant. We explore a simple model,with light flatons which
can decay into $Z$ or $W$ bosons, or into a light Higgs ($h^0$) plus a $Z$
boson, to show that such features can be realized in a wide range of parameter
space. The mass of the NLSP can be as low as $(m_{h^0}+m_Z)/2$, with an axion
scale of order $10^{10}$ GeV and a final reheat temperature typically of order
$10\GeV$. Then, the flatino LSP is a good dark matter candidate because the
reheat temperature can be high enough to allow its production from the decay of
the thermalized LSP, while low enough to prevent its overproduction from the
decay of sfermions.

A 63, 012306 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevA.63.012306",,"quant-ph",,"  Although the initial proposal for ion trap quantum computation made use of an
auxiliary internal level to perform logic between ions, this resource is not
necessary in principle. Instead, one may perform such operations directly using
sideband laser pulses, operating with an arbitrary (sufficiently small)
Lamb-Dicke parameter. We explore the potential of this technique, showing how
to perform logical operations between the internal state of an ion and the
collective motional state and giving explicit constructions for a
controlled-not gate between ions.

a cavity with variable parameters. The atom in the ground state located in the
initially empty cavity can be excited by variation of cavity parameters. We
have discovered two mechanisms of atomic excitation. The first arises due to
the interaction of the atom with the non-stationary electromagnetic field
created by modulation of cavity parameters. If the characteristic time of
variation of cavity parameters is of the order of the atomic transition time,
the processes of photon creation and atomic excitation are going on
simultaneously and hence excitation of the atom cannot be reduced to trivial
absorption of the photons produced by the dynamical Casimir effect. The second
mechanism is ""shaking"" of the atom due to fast modulation of its ground state
Lamb shift which takes place as a result of fast variation of cavity arameters.
The last mechanism has no connection with the vacuum dynamical Casimir effect.
Moreover, it opens a new channel of photon creation in the non-stationary
cavity. Nevertheless, the process of photon creation is altered by the presence
of the atom in the cavity, even if one disregards the existence of the new
channel. In particular, it removes the restriction for creation of only even
number of photons and also changes the expectation value for the number of
created photons. Our consideration is based on a simple model of a two-level
atom interacting with a single mode of the cavity field. Qualitatively our
results are valid for a real atom in a physical cavity.
