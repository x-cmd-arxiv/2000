Fornax cluster galaxies and combined with literature data to define a new
V-band SBF distance indicator. We use new stellar population models, based on
the latest Padua isochrones transformed empirically to the observational plane,
to predict SBF magnitudes and integrated colours for a wide range of population
ages and metallicities. We examine the sensitivity of the predictions to
changes in the isochrones, transformations, and IMF. The new models reproduce
the SBF data for globular clusters fairly well, especially if higher
metallicity globulars are younger. The models also give a good match to the
""fluctuation colors"" of elliptical galaxies. In order to obtain theoretical
calibrations of the SBF distance indicators, we combine our single-burst models
into composite population models. These models reproduce the observed behavior
of the SBF magnitudes as a function of stellar population parameters, including
the steep colour dependence found for HST/WFPC2 F814W SBF data. Because the
theoretical SBF calibrations are fairly sensitive to uncertain details of
stellar evolution, the empirical calibrations are more secure. However, the
sensitivity of SBF to these finer details potentially makes it a powerful
constraint for stellar evolution and population synthesis. [abbridged]

Magellanic galaxy NGC 2366 (D = 3.44 Mpc) is presented, based on ultraviolet
and optical HST/STIS spectroscopy. Contemporary WFPC2 and WHT imaging reveals a
modest V-band brightness increase of ~ 0.2 mag per year between 1996 January
and 1997 November, reaching V=17.4 mag, corresponding to Mv=-10.4 mag.
Subsequently, V1 underwent a similar decrease in V-band brightness, together
with a UV brightening of 0.35 mag from 1997 November to 1999 November.
  The optical spectrum of V1 is dominated by H emission lines, with Fe II, He I
and Na I also detected. In the ultraviolet, a forest of Fe absorption features
and numerous absorption lines typical of mid-B supergiants are observed. From a
spectral analysis with the non-LTE, line-blanketed code of Hillier & Miller
(1998), we derive stellar parameters of T*=11kK, R*=420Ro, log(L/Lo)=6.35
during 1997 November, and T*=13kK, R*=315Ro, log(L/Lo)=6.4 for 1999 July. The
wind properties of V1 are also exceptional, with Mdot ~ 4.4 x 10e-4 Mo/yr and
$v_{\infty} ~ $300 km/s, allowing for a clumped wind (filling factor = 0.3),
and assuming H/He ~ 4 by number.
  The presence of Fe lines in the UV and optical spectrum of V1 permits an
estimate of the heavy elemental abundance of NGC 2363 from our spectral
synthesis. Although some deficiencies remain, allowance for charge exchange
reactions in our calculations supports a SMC-like metallicity, that has
previously been determined for NGC 2363 from nebular oxygen diagnostics.
  Considering a variety of possible progenitor stars, V1 has definitely
undergone a giant eruption, with a substantial increase in stellar luminosity,
radius, and almost certainly mass-loss rate.

neighborhood harbor short-period planets characterized by near-circular orbits
and orbital periods P<20 days. However, among the most metal-rich stars
(defined as having [Fe/H]>0.2 dex), it appears that the fraction increases to
10%. Using the Hipparcos database and the Hauck & Mermilliod (1998) compilation
of Stromgren uvby photometry, we identify a sample of 206 metal-rich stars of
spectral type K, G, and F which have an enhanced probability of harboring
short-period planets. Many of these stars would be excellent candidates for
addition to radial velocity surveys. We have searched the Hipparcos epoch
photometry for transiting planets within our 206 star catalog. We find that the
quality of the Hipparcos data is not high enough to permit unambiguous transit
detections. It is, however, possible to identify candidate transit periods. We
then discuss various ramifications of the stellar metallicity - planet
connection. First, we show that there is preliminary evidence for increasing
metallicity with increasing stellar mass among known planet-bearing stars. This
trend can be explained by a scenario in which planet-bearing stars accrete an
average of 30 Earth Masses of rocky material after the gaseous protoplanetary
disk phase has ended. We present dynamical calculation which suggest that a
survey of metallicities of spectroscopic binary stars can be used to understand
the root cause of the stellar metallicity - planet connection.

temperature anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background

planets) in the far side-lobes of such an experiment, it is necessary to
perform the beam convolution over the full sky. We discuss this process in
multipole space for an arbitrary beam response, fully including the effects of
beam asymmetry and cross-polarization. The form of the convolution in multipole
space is such that the Wandelt-Gorski fast technique for all-sky convolution of
scalar signals (e.g. temperature) can be applied with little modification. We
further show that for the special case of a pure co-polarized, axisymmetric
beam the effect of the convolution can be described by spin-weighted window
functions. In the limits of a small angle beam and large Legendre multipoles,
the spin-weight 2 window function for the linear polarization reduces to the
usual scalar window function used in previous analyses of beam effects in CMB
polarimetry experiments. While we focus on the example of polarimetry
experiments in the context of CMB studies, we emphasise that the formalism we
develop is applicable to anisotropic filtering of arbitrary tensor fields on

filtered data, and the necessary corrections are derived. To that end, we
reformulate the imaging (deconvolution/calibration) process as a sequential
estimation of the locations of astronomical sources. This not only leads to an
extended CLEAN algorithm, the formulation also allows to insert other array
signal processing techniques for direction finding, and gives estimates of the
expected image quality and the amount of interference suppression that can be
achieved. Finally, a maximum likelihood procedure for the imaging is derived,
and an approximate ML image formation technique is proposed to overcome the
computational burden involved. Some of the effects of the new algorithms are
shown in simulated images. Keywords: Radio astronomy, synthesis imaging,
parametric imaging, interference mitigation, spatial filtering, maximum
likelihood, minimum variance, CLEAN.

3x10^{-12} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the ROSAT energy band (0.1-2.4 keV) and spans
3 decades in X-ray luminosity (10^{42} - 10^{45} h^{-2} erg s^{-1}), containing
galaxy groups and rich clusters out to a redshift z~0.3. Covering a contiguous
area of 4.24 sr REFLEX is the largest X-ray cluster sample to date for which
spatial clustering has been analysed. Correlation studies using clusters
selected on the basis of their X-ray emission are particularly interesting as
they are largely free from the projection biases inherent to optical studies.
For the entire flux-limited sample we find that the correlation length (the
scale at which the correlation amplitude passes through unity) r_0~20
h^{-1}Mpc. For example, if a power-law fit is made to xi(r) over the range 4-40
h^{-1} Mpc then r_0=18.8+-0.9. An indication of the robustness of this result
comes from the high degree of isotropy seen in the clustering pattern on scales
close to the correlation length. On larger scales xi(r) deviates from a
power-law, crossing zero at ~45h^{-1} Mpc. From an examination of 5
volume-limited cluster sub-samples we find no significant trend of r_0 with

sequences for the same polygon can have very different lengths, the shape and

$Z^0$ decays allow one to check the quark combinatorics relations for a new
type of processes, namely: quark jets in the decays $Z^0 \to q\bar q \to
hadrons$. In this paper we review quark combinatorics rules for the yields of
vector and pseudoscalar mesons, $V/P$, in the central and fragmentation regions
of the hadronic $Z^0$ decays. It is stressed that in the central region a
direct verification of quark combinatorics rules is rather problematic because
of a considerable background related to the decay of highly excited resonances;
however such a verification is possible in the fragmentation region, at
$x_{hadron} \sim 0.5-1$, where the contribution of resonance decays is
suppressed due to the rapid decrease of spectra with increasing $x_{hadron}$.
It is shown that the experimental data in the fragmentation region for
$\rho^0/\pi^0$ and $p/\pi^+$ are in a reasonable agreement with the predictions
of quark combinatorics. The ratios of the heavy meson yields, $B^*/B$ and
  $D^*/D$, are also discussed: the data demonstrate a good agreement with the
quark combinatorial results. We analyse the structure of the suppression
parameters for strange and heavy quark productions in soft processes and
estimate their order of magnitudes in the multiperipheral processes; the ratio
$K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ at $x_{hadron}\sim 0.5-0.8$ and production probabilities of
the $c\bar c$ and $b \bar b$ mesons are in a good agreement with the estimates.

$\nu_\mu $'s, if $\Delta m^2_{21} \leftrightarrow \Delta m^2_{\rm sol}$ and $
\Delta m^2_{32} \leftrightarrow \Delta m^2_{\rm atm}$. On the other hand, the
second option is an extension of the idea of the former to the case of four

$\nu_s$), when among their massive states $\nu_0, \nu_1, \nu_2, \nu_3$ there

so-called ``brane bending'' effects) typically used to compute the graviton
propagator on the Randall-Sundrum brane. In particular, the brane, which has
non-vanishing tension, explicitly breaks some part of the diffeomorphisms, so
that there are subtleties arising in going to, say, the axial gauge or the
harmonic gauge in the presence of (non-conformal) matter localized on the
brane. We therefore compute the graviton propagator in the gauge where only the
graviphoton fluctuations are set to zero (the diffeomorphisms necessary for
this gauge fixing are intact), but the graviscalar component is untouched. We
point out that in the Gaussian normal coordinates (where the graviscalar
component vanishes on the brane) the graviton propagator blows up in the
ultra-violet near the brane. In fact, the allowed gauge transformations, which
do not lead to such ultra-violet behavior of the graviton propagator, are such
that the coupling of the graviscalar to the brane matter cannot be gauged away
in the ultra-violet. Because of this, at the quantum level, where we expect
various additional terms to be generated in the brane world-volume action
including those involving the graviscalar, fine-tuning (which is independent of
that for the brane cosmological constant) is generically required to preserve
consistent coupling between bulk gravity and brane matter. We also reiterate
that in such warped backgrounds higher curvature terms in the bulk are
generically expected to delocalize gravity.

  subsection 4.3.2 and one reference are corrected","Grav.Cosmol. 8 (2002) 261-271",,,"hep-th gr-qc hep-ph",,"  The problem of a regular matter source for the Kerr spinning particle is
discussed. A class of minimal deformations of the Kerr-Newman solution is
considered obeying the conditions of regularity and smoothness for the metric
and its matter source.
  It is shown that for charged source corresponding matter forms a rotating
bag-like core having (A)dS interior and smooth domain wall boundary. Similarly,
the requirement of regularity of the Kerr-Newman electromagnetic field leads to
superconducting properties of the core.
  We further consider the U(I) x U'(I) field model (which was used by Witten to
describe cosmic superconducting strings), and we show that it can be adapted
for description of superconducting bags having a long range external
electromagnetic field and another gauge field confined inside the bag.
Supersymmetric version of the Witten field model given by Morris is analyzed,
and corresponding BPS domain wall solution interpolating between the outer and
internal supersymmetric vacua is considered. The charged bag bounded by this
BPS domain wall represents an `ultra-extreme' state with a total mass which is
lower than BPS bound of the wall. It is also shown that supergravity suggests
the AdS vacuum state inside the bag.
  Peculiarities of this model for the rotating bag-like source of the
Kerr-Newman geometry are discussed.

advantages, like higher gradient capabilities or operational costs reduction,

operation however could spoil the energy stability of the proton beam and needs
thus to be carefully studied. First, transient beam-loading effects, arising
from the large beam phase slippage along a multi-cell cavity and associated
with the finite RF energy propagation, can induce significant energy modulation
with a too small cell-to-cell coupling or a too large number of cells. Second,
due to beam phase slippage effects along the linac, energy spread exhibits a
larger sensitivity to cavity fields fluctuations than relativistic particles. A
computer code, initially developed for electron beams has been extended to
proton beams. It solves the 6xN coupled differential equations, needed to
describe cavity fields and beam-cavity interactions of a high-energy linac
