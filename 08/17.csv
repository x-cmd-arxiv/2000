  Submitted to Physical Review D","Phys.Rev. D63 (2001) 123002","10.1103/PhysRevD.63.123002",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose fast, exact and efficient algorithms for the convolution of two
arbitrary functions on the sphere which speed up computations by a factor
\order{\sqrt{N}} compared to present methods where $N$ is the number of pixels.
No simplifying assumptions are made other than bandlimitation. This reduces
typical computation times for convolving the full sky with the asymmetric beam
pattern of a megapixel Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) mission from months to
minutes. Our methods enable realistic simulation and careful analysis of data
from such missions, taking into account the effects of asymmetric ``point
spread functions'' and far side lobes of the physical beam. While motivated by
CMB studies, our methods are general and hence applicable to the convolution or
filtering of any scalar field on the sphere with an arbitrary, asymmetric
kernel. We show in an appendix that the same ideas can be applied to the
inverse problems of map-making and beam reconstruction by similarly
accelerating the {\em transpose convolution} which is needed for the iterative
solution of the normal equations.

accretion discs driving jets are presented. For the first time, an energy
equation describing the effects of entropy generation along streamlines is
included. Using a simplified approach, we showed that thermal effects have a
tremendous influence on the disc capability to feed jets with mass.
  The disc ejection efficiency is measured by the parameter $\xi= d \ln
\dot{M}_{a}/d \ln{r}$, where $ \dot{M}_{a}(r)$ is the local disc accretion
rate. While previous self-similar solutions were only able to produce jets with
$\xi \sim 0.01$, solutions with a coronal heating display huge efficiencies up
to $\xi \sim 0.5$. Moreover, taking thermal effects into account allows to
obtain both fast and slow magnetic rotators.
  Since most of the jet properties (like asymptotic velocity or degree of
collimation) depend on the mass load, it arises from this study that any
quantitative result requires a detailled analysis of the disc energetics.

the remaining eight sources, are combined with data from the WENSS, NVSS and
GB6 surveys to study the radio properties of the lobes of these sources at
arcminute resolution. We investigate radio source asymmetries, equipartition
energy densities in the lobes, the presence of lobe pressure evolution with
redshift, the spectral age and the density of the environments of these
sources. We find that the armlength asymmetries of GRGs are slightly larger
than those of smaller sized 3CR radio galaxies and that these are difficult to
explain as arising from orientation effects only. We also find indications that
the lobes of the GRGs, despite their large sizes, are still overpressured with
respect to their environment. Further, we argue that any evolution of lobe
pressure with redshift in these large sources is due to selection effects. A
spectral ageing analysis suggests that the GRGs in our sample are the oldest
members of the group of relatively high power radio sources whose radio powers
have evolved to their currently observed lower values.

at about $NUV_{AB}=26.0$, which is not predicted either by no-evolution models
based upon a local luminosity function with a steep faint end slope, nor by a
semi-analytic model in which starbursts are caused by major mergers. The FUV

a short duty cycle for star formation, additional starbursts triggered by minor

faintest HVCs in the Galactic halo, too far away for a Galactic fountain. This
model cannot explain the bright and spatially varying H-alpha in the Magellanic
Stream, which requires another source of ionization. However, we do not find
any HVCs super-faint in H-alpha; even with another ionization source, we
conclude that the detected HVCs are not more than 2--4 times the distance of
the MS (100-200 kpc).

highest velocity shock ionization models. We note that the CII line is 5 times
more sensitive to shock ionization than the high ionization UV lines, and show
that a combination of shock and photo-ionization provides a better overall fit
to the integrated spectra of HzRGs. Because most HzRGs have radio sizes <~150

stability of the spiral arms and counteracts the increasing mass of the

shoulders on the red and blue sides which resemble the H-alpha profiles of

extremely broad-line emission in LINERs must be much more common than would be

-thick Nb superconducting film. As a function of magnetic field applied in the
film plane, SPNR exhibits reversible behavior whereas the DC magnetization
shows substantial hysteresis. The difference between these measurements is
attributed to a rotation of vortex magnetic field out of the film plane as the
applied field is reduced. Since SPNR measures only the magnetization parallel
to the film plane whereas DC magnetization is strongly influenced by the
perpendicular component of magnetization when there is a slight sample tilt,
combining the two techniques allows one to distinguish two components of
magnetization in a thin film.

multiplication algorithms.
  The first algorithm solves the APSP problem for weighted directed graphs in
which the edge weights are integers of small absolute value in $\Ot(n^{2+\mu})$
time, where $\mu$ satisfies the equation $\omega(1,\mu,1)=1+2\mu$ and
$\omega(1,\mu,1)$ is the exponent of the multiplication of an $n\times n^\mu$
matrix by an $n^\mu \times n$ matrix. Currently, the best available bounds on
$\omega(1,\mu,1)$, obtained by Coppersmith, imply that $\mu<0.575$. The running
time of our algorithm is therefore $O(n^{2.575})$. Our algorithm improves on
the $\Ot(n^{(3+\omega)/2})$ time algorithm, where $\omega=\omega(1,1,1)<2.376$
is the usual exponent of matrix multiplication, obtained by Alon, Galil and
Margalit, whose running time is only known to be $O(n^{2.688})$.

directed graphs with {\em arbitrary} non-negative real weights. The algorithm
runs in $\Ot((n^\omega/\eps)\log (W/\eps))$ time, where $\eps>0$ is an error
parameter and W is the largest edge weight in the graph, after the edge weights
are scaled so that the smallest non-zero edge weight in the graph is 1. It
returns estimates of all the distances in the graph with a stretch of at most
$1+\eps$. Corresponding paths can also be found efficiently.

analysis utilised the normalised cumulants, calculated in three-dimensional
phase space, of the reaction e+e- -> Z -> hadrons using a large Monte Carlo
event sample. The multi-sources reactions were simulated by overlaying a few
independent single e+e- annihilation events. It was found that as the number of

considerations of source mixing which dilutes the correlations by a factor of

measurements in hadron and nucleus induced reactions both in one (rapidity) and

Many techniques such as maximum likelihood (ML), Infomax, cumulant matching,

Unfortunately, up to now, many of these methods could not account completely
for noise on the data, for different number of sources and sensors, for lack of
spatial independence and for time correlation of the sources. Recently, the
Bayesian approach has been used to push farther these limitations of the
conventional methods. This paper proposes a unifying approach to source
separation based on the Bayesian estimation. We first show that this approach
gives the possibility to explain easily the major known techniques in sources
separation as special cases. Then we propose new methods based on maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimation, either to estimate directly the sources, or the
mixing matrices or even both.

of Hopf algebras; Sh(g) contains Ug. 2) When g and h are Lie algebras, and
r_{gh} \in g\otimes h, we construct an element R(r_{gh}) of Sh(g)\otimes Sh(h)
satisfying quasitriangularity identities; R(r_{gh}) defines a Hopf algebra
morphism from Sh(g)^* to Sh(h). 3) When g = h and r\in g\otimes g is a solution
of CYBE, we construct a series \rho(r) such that R(\rho(r)) is a solution of
QYBE. The expression of \rho(r) in terms of r involves Lie polynomials, and we

vanishing statements for cohomologies arising from universal algebras for the
solutions of CYBE. 4) We define the quantization of a Lie bialgebra g as the

X-ray regime requires the acceleration of electron bunches with an rms length
of 25 to 50 micro meters. The wakefields generated by these sub picosecond
bunches extend into the frequency range well beyond the threshold for Cooper
pair breakup (about 750 GHz) in superconducting niobium at 2 K. It is shown,
that the superconducting cavities can indeed be operated with 25 micro meter
bunches without suffering a breakdown of superconductivity (quench), however at
the price of a reduced quality factor and an increased heat transfer to the
superfluid helium bath. This was first shown by wakefield calculations based on
the diffraction model. In the meantime a more conventional method of computing
wake fields in the time domain by numerical methods was developed and used for
the wakefield calculations. Both methods lead to comparable results: the
operation of TESLA with 25 micro meter bunches is possible but leads to an
additional heat load due to the higher order modes (HOMs). Therefore HOM
dampers for these high frequencies are under construction. These dampers are
located in the beam pipes between the 9-cell cavities. So it is of interest, if
there are trapped modes in the cavity due to closed photon orbits. In this
paper we investigate the existence of trapped modes and the distribution of
heat load over the surface of the TESLA cavity by numerical photon tracking.

\~100 A. In an effort to push to 120 nm and beyond, we have designed and are
commissioning a bunch compressor to increase the peak current to 600 A or more.
The bunch compressor uses a four-dipole chicane at an energy of 100 to 210 MeV.
To provide options for control of emittance growth due to coherent synchrotron
radiation (CSR), the chicane has variable R56. The central pair of dipoles is
movable, accommodating variable R56 with less concern about emittance dilution
from nonuniformity of the dipole field. The symmetry of the chicane is also
variable via longitudinal motion of the final dipole, which is predicted to
have an effect on emittance growth. Following the chicane, a three-screen
emittance measurement system should permit resolution of the difference in
emittance growth between various chicane configurations. A vertical bending
magnet analysis line is present to permit imaging of correlations between
transverse and energy coordinates. This paper reviews the features and expected
performance of the chicane. A companion paper discusses the physics design in
detail.

It
consists in a diffraction pattern whose spatial location progresses with time.
The pattern is produced by wave packet quantum scattering off an attractive or
repulsive time independent potential. An analytical formula for the pattern at
$t\to\infty$ is derived both in one dimension and in three dimensions. The
condition for the pattern to exist is developed. The phenomenon is shown
numerically and analytically for the Dirac equation in one dimension also. An
experiment for the verification of the phenomenon is described and simulated
numerically.

bound entangled state and we analyze its properties.
