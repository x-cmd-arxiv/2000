by deriving accurate centroids in the ground-based MACHO images using
difference image analysis (DIA) and then transforming the DIA coordinates to

the X-ray continuum absorption. We show that the gas has to have large column
densities in ions of major UV absorption lines, such as CIV, NV, OVI and Ne

absorption lines have to be saturated if the X-ray absorber intersects the line

observational diagnostics of the accretion flow geometry. Models of this
reflected spectrum generally assume that the accretion disk can be
characterized by material in a single ionization state. However, several
authors have recently stressed the importance of the classic ionization
instability for X-ray irradiated gas in hydrostatic balance. This instability
leads to a discontinuous transition in the vertical structure of the disk,
resulting in a hot ionized skin above much cooler material. If the Compton
temperature of the skin is high then even iron is completely ionized, and the
skin does not produce any spectral features. These new models, where the
ionization structure of the disk is calculated self-consistently, require an
excessive amount of computing power and so are difficult to use in directly
fitting observed X-ray spectra. Instead, we invert the problem by simulating
X-ray spectra produced by the new reflection models, and then fit these with
the old, single zone reflection models, to assess the extent to which the
derived accretion geometry depends on the reflection model used. We find that
the single zone ionization models can severely underestimate the covering
fraction of the ``cold'' material as seen from the X-ray source if the optical
depth in the ionized skin is of order unity, and that this can produce an
apparent correlation between the covering fraction and the X-ray spectral index
similar in nature to that reported by Zdziarski, Lubinski and Smith (1999).

model the number counts, redshift distribution, and time-delay factors of GRBs.
We present luminosity function fits to the BATSE log N-log P relation for
different redshift distributions of the bursts. Our results imply about 1-2
GRBs every one million Type II supernovae, and a characteristic
`isotropic-equivalent' burst luminosity in the range 3-20 x 1e51 ergs/s (for
H_0=65 km/s/Mpc). We compute the rate of multiple imaging of background GRBs
due to foreground mass condensations in a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter
cosmology, assuming that dark halos approximate singular isothermal spheres on
galaxy scales and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles on group/cluster scales, and are
distributed in mass according to the Press-Schechter model. We show that the
expected sensivity increase of Swift relative to BATSE could result in a few
strongly lensed individual bursts detected down to a photon flux of 0.1
phot/s/cm^2 in a 3-year survey. Because of the partial sky coverage, however,
it is unlikely that the Swift satellite will observe recurrent events (lensed
pairs).

After scaling, the only parameters of the static theory are a temperature
variable and a stiffness variable. For moderate to large stiffness, our static
results show nested stars, unnested stars, fans and other nodes, triangular and
trapezoidal regions of trapped hexagonal phase, etc observed in electron
microscopy of Ta4N and Mg-Cd alloys, and also in lead orthovanadate (which is
trigonal-monoclinic); we even find imperfections in some nodes, like those

formation of these static patterns, and also transitory structures such as
12-armed bursts, streamers and striations which are also seen experimentally.

in the resulting effective model. The problem is formulated in the path
integral formalism where the spin variables are defined as bilinear
combinations of the Grassmann fields. The static approximation is used to treat
both the pairing and the spin terms together with the replica symmetry ansatz.
Henceforth, the problem can be reduced to a one site problem. The field in the
z direction, Hz, separates the order parameters in two groups: parallel and
transverse to it. We have obtained a phase diagram in T-g space with zero
transverse spin-glass ordering, g being the strength of the pairing
interaction. It has been possible to locate the transition temperature between
the normal paramagnetic phase (NP) and the phase where there is a long range
order corresponding to formation of pairs (PAIR). The transition ends at the
temperature Tf, the transition temperature between the NP phase and the spin
glass (SG) phase. Tf decreases for stronger fields allowing us to calculate the
NP-PAIR line transition even at low temperatures. The NP-PAIR transition line
has a complex dependence with g and Hz, having a tricritical point depending on
Hz from where second order transitions occur for higher values of g and first
order transitions occur for lower values of g.

consists of generating phonemic representations reflecting the Flemish and

(which in turn is based on the actual speech recordings). We compare several
possible approaches to achieve the text-to-pronunciation mapping task:
memory-based learning, transformation-based learning, rule induction, maximum
entropy modeling, combination of classifiers in stacked learning, and stacking
of meta-learners. We are interested both in optimal accuracy and in obtaining
insight into the linguistic regularities involved. As far as accuracy is
concerned, an already high accuracy level (93% for Celex and 86% for Fonilex at
word level) for single classifiers is boosted significantly with additional
error reductions of 31% and 38% respectively using combination of classifiers,
and a further 5% using combination of meta-learners, bringing overall word
level accuracy to 96% for the Dutch variant and 92% for the Flemish variant. We
also show that the application of machine learning methods indeed leads to
increased insight into the linguistic regularities determining the variation

state-of-the art parsing accuracy to the psycholinguistic insight that larger

cycles and a considerable amount of double work, brought on by the concept of
multiple derivations, which is necessary for probabilistic processing, but
which is not convincingly related to a proper linguistic backbone. It is
however possible to re-interpret the dop-model as a pattern-matching model,
which tries to maximize the size of the substructures that construct the parse,
rather than the probability of the parse. By emphasizing this memory-based
aspect of the dop-model, it is possible to do away with multiple derivations,
opening up possibilities for efficient Viterbi-style optimizations, while still

part of our description of nature because of considerable indirect evidence and
successful predictions, and a discussion of the essential role of data for
formulating and testing string theory, these lectures focus on the role of the
supersymmetry soft-breaking Lagrangian in connecting experiment and string
theory. How to measure tan$\beta$ and the soft parameters is examined via a
number of applications, and the difficulty of measuring tan$\beta$ at hadron
colliders is explained. In each case the important role of soft phases is made
explicit, and the true number of parameters is counted. Applications include
the chargino and neutralino sectors, the Higgs sector and how its results
change when phases are included, measuring the (relative) gluino phase, CP
violation in K and B systems and whether all CP violation can be due to soft
phases, how to learn if the LSP is the cold dark matter of the universe, and
baryogenesis. It is emphasized that the success of supersymmetry in explaining
the breaking of electroweak symmetry is probably its most important
achievement, and implications of that explanation for superpartner masses are
shown. Combining many of these considerations, a further application argues
that a lepton collider of total energy 600 GeV with a polarized beam is one we
can be confident will do important physics even after LHC. The question of the
origins of CP violation, whether the CKM phase can be zero, and the possibility
that the soft phases can tell us about compactification and supersymmetry
breaking are discussed. Some of the applications and issues are examined in a
D-brane based model that can describe the usual collider and dark matter
phenomenology, and includes phases and CP violation as well.

hadronic final states in electron-positron annihilations using the
$O(\alpha_s^2)$ partonic matrix elements (MEs) for $e^+e^-\to q\bar qgg$ and
$e^+e^-\to q\bar q Q\bar Q$. The consequent phenomenology is discussed in the
case of four-jet signatures of particular relevance to future electron-positron

particular, we prove that the three spacetime structural identities, which now
become ``contaminated'' by internal degrees of freedom, remain invariant with
respect to internal gauge transformations. In a Weyl Cartan spacetime, the
theory regains the original form of Einstein's equations, in which gauge field
sources on the r.h.s. determine on the l.h.s the geometry of spacetime and the
fields it induces. In the more general case we identify new contributions of
weak magnitude in the interaction between the Yang-Mills field and gravity. The
merger of spacetime with internal degrees of freedom which we propose here is
not constrained by the usual Coleman-Mandula considerations.

radiation is represented by a conformal field theory with a large central
charge. Following recent ideas on holography, it is argued that the entropy
density in the early universe is bounded by a multiple of the Hubble constant.
The entropy of the CFT is expressed in terms of the energy and the Casimir
energy via a universal Cardy formula that is valid for all dimensions. A new
purely holographic bound is postulated which restricts the sub-extensive
entropy associated with the Casimir energy. Unlike the Hubble bound, the new
bound remains valid throughout the cosmological evolution. When the new bound
is saturated the Friedman equation exactly coincides with the universal Cardy
formula, and the temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the Hubble parameter
and its time-derivative.

efficiencies using numerical integration, reporting re- sults for the standard
micromaser arrangement in which the cavity is pumped by excited atoms and the
excitation levels of the emerging atoms are measured. In addition, the atomic
inversion and the Fano-Mandel function for the detection of de-excited atoms is
calculated for compari- son to the recent experimental results of Weidinger et
al. [1], which reports the first observation of trapping states.

Lett. 85, 3121 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.3121",,"quant-ph",,"  We experimentally demonstrate and systematically study the stimulated revival
(echo) of motional wave packet oscillations. For this purpose, we prepare wave
packets in an optical lattice by non-adiabatically shifting the potential and
stimulate their reoccurence by a second shift after a variable time delay. This
technique, analogous to spin echoes, enables one even in the presence of strong
dephasing to determine the coherence time of the wave packets. We find that for
strongly bound atoms it is comparable to the cooling time and much longer than
the inverse of the photon scattering rate.
