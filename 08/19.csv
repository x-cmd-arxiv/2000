the core collapse of massive stars, and thus it is inevitable that the
environments of these GRBs are preburst stellar winds or dense media. We
studied, for the first time, the wind model for afterglows based on the
Blandford-McKee self-similar solution of a relativistic shock, and suggested
that GRB 970616 is an interactor with a stellar wind. We also proposed a dense
medium model for some afterglows, e.g., the steepening in the light curve of
the R-band afterglow of GRB 990123 may be caused by the adiabatic shock which
has evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a
dense medium. We further discussed the dense medium model in more details, and
investigated the effects of synchrotron self absorption and energy injection. A
shock in a dense medium becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a short
relativistic phase. The afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stage
decays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage. Since some models for GRB
energy sources predicted that a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be
born during GRB formation, we discussed the effect of such a pulsar on the
evolution of the nonrelativistic shock through magnetic dipole radiation. We
found that in the pulsar energy injection case, the dense medium model fits
very well all the observational data of GRB 980519. Recently, we combined the
dense medium model with the pulsar energy injection effect to provide a good
fit to the optical afterglow data of GRB 000301C.

where the linear bias parameter b is the ratio of the fluctuation amplitudes of
the galaxy and mass distributions. However, the relation between the galaxy and
mass density fields depends on the complex physics of galaxy formation, and it
can in general be non-linear, stochastic, and perhaps non-local. The
one-parameter linear bias model is almost certainly oversimplified, which leads
to the obvious question: What is the quantity beta that is actually measured by
different techniques? To address this question, we estimate beta from galaxy
distributions that are constructed by applying a variety of locally biased
galaxy formation models to cosmological N-body simulations. We compare the
values of beta estimated using three different techniques: a density-density
comparison similar to the POTENT analysis, a velocity-velocity comparison
similar to the VELMOD analysis, and an anisotropy analysis of the
redshift-space power spectrum. In most cases, we find that beta estimated using
all three methods is similar to the asymptotic value of
Omega^{0.6}/b_{sigma}(R) at large R, where b_{sigma}(R) is the ratio of rms
galaxy fluctuations to rms mass fluctuations on scale R. Thus, something close
to the conventional interpretation of beta continues to hold even for complex
bias models. Moreover, we find that beta estimates made using these three
methods should, in principle, agree with each other. It is thus unlikely that
non-linear or scale-dependent bias is responsible for the discrepancies that
exist among current measurements of beta from different techniques.

conductance of 2e^2/h when coupled to a suitable reflector. If two or more

higher-order Green's functions for wave equations which are defined as
distributions that satisfy wave equations with the corresponding order
covariant derivatives of the Dirac delta function as the source terms. The
constructed solution is applied to the study of various geometric effects on
the generation and propagation of electromagnetic wave tails to first order in
the Riemann tensor. Generally the received radiation tail occurs after a time
delay which represents geometrical backscattering by the central gravitational
source. It is shown that the truly nonlocal wave-propagation correction (the
tail term) takes a universal form which is independent of multipole order. In a
particular case, if the radiation pulse is generated by the source during a
finite time interval, the tail term after the primary pulse is entirely
determined by the energy-momentum vector of the gravitational field source: the
form of the tail term is independent of the multipole structure of the
gravitational source. We apply the results to a compact binary system and
conclude that under certain conditions the tail energy can be a noticeable
fraction of the primary pulse energy. We argue that the wave tails should be
carefully considered in energy calculations of such systems.

several test stands, where high power components are evaluated and fundamental
research is performed studying rf breakdown and dark current production.
Continuing development has resulted in a Periodic Permanent Magnet (PPM)
focused 50 MW klystron, tested at SLAC and subsequently contracted for
manufacture by industry in England and Japan. A 75 MW version of that PPM
klystron was built at SLAC and reached 75 MW, with 2.8 microsecond pulses.
Based on this design, a prototype 75 MW klystron, designed for low-cost
manufacture, is currently under development at SLAC, and will eventually be
procured from industry in modest quantities for advanced NLC tests. Beyond
these developments, the design of Multiple Beam Klystrons (MBKs) is under study
at SLAC. MBKs offer the possibility of considerably lower modulator costs by
producing comparable power to the klystrons now available, at much lower
voltages.

extended operator basis. In particular, a model-independent analysis of CP
asymmetries that require the presence of unitarity phases, in addition to CP

order the weak scale. This is demonstrated by a perturbative computation of the
radion wavefunction. A consequence of the background configuration for the

states of the bulk scalars couple directly to the Standard Model fields on the

Relativistic Effective Core Potential (RECP), only valence and some outer-core

from calculations. Therefore, the computational efforts can be dramatically
reduced.
  However, in the framework of the standard nodeless radially local RECP
versions, any attempt to extend the space of explicitly treated electrons more
than some limit does not improve the accuracy of the calculations. The errors
caused by these (nodeless) RECPs can range up to 2000 $cm^{-1}$ and more for
the dissociation and transition energies even for lowest-lying excitations that
can be unsatisfactory for many applications. Moreover, the direct calculation
of such properties as electronic densities near heavy nuclei, hyperfine
structure, and matrix elements of other operators singular on heavy nuclei is
impossible as a result of the smoothing of the orbitals in the core regions.
  In the present paper, ways to overcome these disadvantages of the RECP method
are discussed. The developments of the RECP method suggested by the authors are

beam pulses with the expanding plasma plume generated by earlier pulses
striking the x-ray converter or a septum, and the more subtle effect involving
the extraction of light ions from a plasma by the head of the beam pulse. These
light ions may be due to contaminants on the surface of the beam pipe or
converter, or, for subsequent pulses, in the material of the converter. The
space charge depression of the beam could accelerate the light ions to
velocities of several mm/ns. As the ions moved through the body of the incoming

converter and a time varying x-ray spot. Studies of the beam-generated plasma
at the x-ray converter have been previously reported. In this paper we describe
Faraday cup measurements performed to detect and quantify the flow of
backstreaming ions as the ETA beam pulse impinges on preformed plasma.

looking toward the development and commissioning of several new experiments.
Recent and planned upgrades of the facilities at GSI, in Russia, and in Japan
greatly enhance the ability to study energy deposition in hot dense matter.
Worldwide target design developments have focused on non-ignition targets for
nearterm experiments and designs which, while lowering the energy required for
ignition, tighten accelerator requirements. The U.S program is transitioning
between scaled beam dynamics experiments and high current experiments with
power-plant-driver-scale beams. Current effort is aimed at preparation for the
next-step large facility, the Integrated Research Experiment (IRE)-- an
induction linac accelerating multiple beams to a few hundred MeV, then focusing
to deliver tens of kilojoules to a target. The goal is to study heavy ion
energy deposition, and to test all of the components and physics needed for an
engineering test of a power plant driver and target chamber. This paper will
include an overview of the Heavy Ion Fusion program abroad and a more in-depth
view of the progress and plans of the U.S. program.

transport the two types of beams from the 80 MeV point at the end of their
respective bunchers up to the storage rings, and then from the storage rings to
the 10 GeV point at the beginning of the bunch compressors. Nominally, the e+
booster structure will be L-band and the others S-band. In transport through
these linacs it is important that the emittances and particle losses stay
within specified tolerances. In particular, the effects of the dipole
wakefield-especially the long-range dipole wakefield-need to be carefully
considered. We present designs of the injector linac structures that employ
simple mode detuning, without damping, and that allow us to satisfy our
tolerance requirements, for both the nominal (2.8 ns) and alternate (1.4 ns)
bunch spacing options.

Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) is developing a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ)
to accelerate an H- beam from 65 keV to 2.5 MeV at the operating frequency of
402.5 MHz. The 4 section, 3.7 meter long RFQ is a 4 vane structure operating at
6% duty factor. The cavity walls are made from OFE Copper with a GlidCop outer
layer to add mechanical strength. A set of 12 cooling channels in the RFQ
cavity walls are fed and controlled separately from 4 channels embedded in the
vanes. An ANSYS finite-element model has been developed to calculate the
deformed shape of the cavity for given RF heat loads and cooling water
temperatures. By combining the FEA results with a SUPERFISH RF cavity
simulation, the relative shift in frequency for a given change in coolant
temperature or heat load can be predicted. The calculated cavity frequency
sensitivity is -33 kHz per 1 degC change in vane water temperature with
constant-temperature wall water. The system start-up transient was also studied
using the previously mentioned FEA model. By controlling the RF power ramp rate
and the independent wall and vane cooling circuit temperatures, the system
turn-on time can be minimized while limiting the frequency shift.

purpose was to learn what components of the present Linac can be used for the
first stage of a proposed proton driver[1]. For this application the Linac must
provide a H- beam in excess of 5000 mA-msec per pulse. The original Fermilab
Linac was designed for protons with a peak current of 75 mA and a pulse length
of four Booster turns (~10 msec). The high energy replacement was designed for
a peak current of 35 mA and a beam pulse length of 50 msec. The present H-
source cannot deliver more than ~80 mA which produces 55 mA in the Linac. Using
a proton source allows the system to be tested to currents of ~100 mA and pulse
lengths long enough to observe the effects of long pulses. This test has shown
that the present Linac can accelerate beam having a peak current up to ~85 mA
with beam loss comparable to the present Linac operation (~45 mA). The results
of the test will be presented.
