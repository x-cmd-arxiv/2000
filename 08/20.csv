vast. When these are used in conjunction with the rich legacy data archives,
the opportunities for scientific discovery multiply rapidly. A Virtual
Observatory (VO) framework will enable transparent and efficient access,
search, retrieval, and visualization of data across multiple data repositories,
which are generally heterogeneous and distributed. Aspects of data mining that
apply to a variety of science user scenarios with a VO are reviewed. The
development of a VO should address the data mining needs of various
astronomical research constituencies. By way of example, two user scenarios are
presented which invoke applications and linkages of data across the catalog and
image domains in order to address specific astrophysics research problems.
These illustrate a subset of the desired capabilities and power of the VO, and
as such they represent potential components of a VO Design Reference Mission.

however, the beam power available for the heavier ions would be limited by ion

that such operation is made feasible by the large transverse and longitudinal

Multi-Q operation provides not only a substantial increase in beam current, but
also enables the use of two strippers, thus reducing the size of linac
required. Since the superconducting (SC) linac operates in CW mode, space
charge effects are essentially eliminated except in the ECR/RFQ region.

to a new generation of solid-state switched high power modulators with
performance rivaling that of hard tube modulators and thyratron switched
line-type modulators. These new solid-state devices offer the promise of higher
efficiency and longer lifetimes at a time when availability of standard
technologies is becoming questionable. A brief discussion of circuit topologies
and solid-state devices is followed by examples of modulators currently in use
or in test. This presentation is intended to give an overview of the current
capabilities of solid-state modulators in various applications.

indicated that the observed beam emittance growth and energy modulation are
often bigger than previous predictions based on Gaussian longitudinal charge
distributions. In this paper, by performing a model study, we show both
analytically and numerically that when the longitudinal bunch charge
distribution involves concentration of charges in a small fraction of the bunch
length, enhancement of the CSR self-interaction beyond the Gaussian prediction
may occur. The level of this enhancement is sensitive to the level of the local
charge concentration.

small emittance aspect ratio delivered by damping rings. Correction of
cross-plane coupling can be important in preventing dilution of the beam
emittance. In order to minimize the vertical emittance, especially for a flat
beam, it is necessary to remove all cross-plane (x-y) correlations. This paper
studies emittance measurement and correction for coupled beams in the presence
of realistic measurement errors. The results of simulations show that
reconstruction of the full 4x4 beam matrix can be misleading in the presence of
errors. We suggest more robust tuning procedures for minimizing linear
coupling.

Linear Collider have been performed over period of about one month in December
1999 -- January 2000. The linac laser alignment system, equipped with a
quadrant photodetector, allowed submicron resolution measurement of the motion
of the middle of the linac tunnel with respect to its ends. Measurements
revealed two major sources responsible for the observed relative motion.
Variation of the external atmospheric pressure was found to be the most
significant cause of short wavelength transverse motion of the tunnel. The long
wavelength component of the motion has been also observed to have a large
contribution from tidal effects. The measured data are essential for
determination of parameters for the Next Linear Collider.

beams by reducing the six-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation to a group of
stochastic ordinary differential equations. These resulting equations usually
have multiplicative noise since the diffusion coefficients in these equations
are functions of position and time. Conventional algorithms, e.g. Euler and
Heun, give only first order convergence of moments in a finite time interval.
In this paper, a stochastic leap-frog algorithm for the numerical integration
of Langevin stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise is
proposed and tested. The algorithm has a second-order convergence of moments in
a finite time interval and requires the sampling of only one uniformly
distributed random variable per time step. As an example, we apply the new
algorithm to the study of a mechanical oscillator with multiplicative noise.
