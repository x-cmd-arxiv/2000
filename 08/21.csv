found by the latter authors (3.75 vs. 4.8) is due partly to the use of a

of the velocity dispersion adopted for a single galaxy, the Milky Way. A
steeper relation is shown to provide a better fit to black hole masses derived
from reverberation mapping studies. Combining the stellar dynamical, gas
dynamical, and reverberation mapping mass estimates, we derive a best-fit
relation M(BH) = 1.30 (+/- 0.36) X 10^8 (sigma_c/200)^{4.72(+/- 0.36)}, where

wide variety of gravitationally lensed features in A383, including a giant arc
formed from the strongly-lensed images of 2 background galaxies, 2 radial arcs,
several multiply-imaged arcs and numerous arclets. Based upon the constraints
from the various lensed features, we construct a detailed mass model for the
central regions of the cluster, taking into account both the cluster-scale
potential and perturbations from individual cluster galaxies. Keck spectroscopy
of one component of the giant arc identifies it as a star-forming galaxy at
z=1.01 and provides an accurate measurement of the cluster mass within the
radius of the giant arc (65kpc) of (3.5+/-0.1)*10^13 Mo. Using the weak shear
measured from our HST observations we extend our mass model to determine a mass
of (1.8+/-0.2)*10^14 Mo within a radius of 250kpc. On smaller scales we employ
the radial arcs as probes of the shape of the mass distribution in the cluster
core (r<20kpc), and find that the mass profile is more peaked than a single NFW
profile. The optical and X-ray properties of A383 indicate the presence of a
central cooling flow, for which we derive a mass deposition rate of >200 Mo/yr.
We also use the X-ray emission from A383 to obtain independent estimates of the
total mass within projected radii of 65 and 250kpc: (4.0+/-1.4)*10^13 Mo and
(1.2+/-0.5)*10^14 Mo, which are consistent with the lensing measurements.

is presented, which enables not only the accurate determination of the stellar
parameters of Alpha Tau, but also serves as a critical review of the ISO-SWS
calibration.
  This study is situated in a broader context of an iterative process in which
both accurate observations of stellar templates and cool star atmosphere models
are involved to improve the ISO-SWS calibration process as well as the
theoretical modelling of stellar atmospheres. Therefore a sample of cool stars,
covering the whole A0 -- M8 spectral classification, has been observed in order
to disentangle calibration problems and problems in generating the theoretical
models and corresponding synthetic spectrum.
  By using stellar parameters found in the literature large discrepancies were
seen between the ISO-SWS data and the generated synthetic spectrum of Alpha
Tau. A study of the influence of various stellar parameters on the theoretical
models and synthetic spectra, in conjunction with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
to evaluate objectively the goodness-of-fit, enables us to pin down the stellar
parameters with a high accuracy: Teff = 3850 +/- 70 K, log g = 1.50 +/- 0.15, M

tracing a starburst nucleus about 45 pc in diameter; 2.) surrounded by a ~600
pc diameter ring of supergiant HII regions revealed in Pa$\alpha$ line
emission; 3.) lying within a molecular ring indicated by its extinction shadow
in H-K; 4.) all at the center of a disturbed spiral galaxy. The luminosities of
the giant HII regions in the ring are extremely high, an order of magnitude
brighter than 30 Doradus. The relation of deep stellar CO bands to surrounding
ionized gas ring to molecular gas indicates that the luminous starburst started
in the nucleus and is propagating outward into the surrounding molecular ring.
This hypothesis is supported by evolutionary starburst modeling that shows that
the properties of NGC1614 can be fitted with two short-lived bursts of star
formation separated by 5 Myr. The total dynamical mass of the starburst region
of 1.3x10^9 Msol is mostly accounted for by the old pre-star burst stellar
population. Although our starburst models use a modified Salpeter IMF, the
tight mass budget suggests that the IMF may contain relatively more 10-30 Msol
stars and fewer low mass stars than the Salpeter function. The dynamical mass
is nearly 4 times smaller than the mass of molecular gas estimated from the
standard ratio of 12CO(1-0) to H2. A number of arguments place the mass of gas
in the starburst region at ~25% of the dynamical mass, nominally about 1/15 and
with an upper limit of 1/10 of the amount estimated from 12CO and the standard
ratio. (Abridged)

that quantum information must play a relevant role in Quantum Gravity (the ""It

will reconcile Quantum Mechanics with General Relativity, can be formulated in
terms of quantum bits of information (qubits) stored in space at the Planck
scale. This conjecture is based on the following arguments: a) The holographic
principle, b) The loop quantum gravity approach and spin networks, c) Quantum
geometry and black hole entropy. Here we present the quantum version of the
holographic principle by considering each pixel of area of an event horizon as
a qubit. This is possible if the horizon is pierced by spin networks' edges of
spin 1\2, in the superposed state of spin ""up"" and spin ""down"".

spatial scale factor matrix $\gamma_{\alpha\beta}(t)$ -along with corresponding
changes on the lapse function $N(t)$ and the shift vector $N^{\alpha}(t)$.
These changes, which are Bianchi Type dependent, form a group and are, in
general, different from those induced by the group SAut(G) -advocated in
earlier investigations as the relevant symmetry group-, they are used to
simplify the form of the line element -and thus simplify Einstein's equations
as well-, without losing generality.
  As far as this simplification procedure is concerned, the transformations
found, are proved to be essentialy unique. For the case of Bianchi Types II and
V, where the most general solutions are known -Taub's and Joseph's,
respectively-, it is explicitly verified that our transformations and only
those, suffice to reduce the generic line element, to the previously known
forms. It becomes thus possible, -for these Types- to give in closed form, the
most general solution, containing all the necessary ``gauge'' freedom.

theory of rational chiral conformal field theories (RCQFTs) we focus on pairs

categories of A and F is strongly intertwined with various issues related to
braided tensor categories. We explain that, given the representation category
of A, the representation category of F can be computed (up to equivalence) by a
purely categorical construction. The latter is of considerable independent
interest since it amounts to a Galois theory for braided tensor categories. We
emphasize the characterization of modular categories as braided tensor
categories with trivial center and we state a double commutant theorem for
subcategories of modular categories. The latter implies that a modular category
M which has a replete full modular subcategory M_1 is equivalent to M_1 x M_2
where M_2=M\cap M_1' is another modular subcategory. On the other hand, the
representation category of A is not determined completely by that of F and we
identify the needed additional data in terms of soliton representations. We
comment on `holomorphic orbifold' theories, i.e. the case where F has trivial
representation theory, and close with some open problems. We point out that our
approach permits the proof of many conjectures and heuristic results on `simple
current extensions' and `holomorphic orbifold models' in the physics literature

meson-hyperon vertices are derived from Dirac-Brueckner calculations of nuclear
matter and extended to hyperons. We examine properties of density dependent
interactions derived from the Bonn A and from the Groningen NN potential as
well as phenomenological interactions. The consistent treatment of the density
dependence introduces rearrangement terms in the expression for the baryon
chemical potential. This leads to a more complex condition for the
$\beta$-equilibrium compared to standard relativistic mean field (RMF)
approaches. We find a strong dependence of the equation of state and the
particle distribution on the choice of the vertex density dependence. Results
for neutron star masses and radii are presented. We find a good agreement with
other models for the maximum mass. Radii are smaller compared to RMF models and
indicate a closer agreement with results of non-relativistic Brueckner
calculations.

is presented. This work was done to analyze and design high efficiency
magnetrons. Arbitrary device-geometries are described by a piecewise planar
boundary. The method is based on an expansion of the electromagnetic fields
into a set of cavity eigenmodes. In order to obtain the self-consistent
solution, iterations are performed until the energy balance is reached. A
boundary integration method is used to take into account space charge effects.
The cavity eigenmodes are found by a method based on the scattering matrix
technique. The geometry is divided into regions. The boundary contour
mode-matching method is used to obtain the scattering matrices for each region.
Electromagnetic fields in each region are expanded into a series of plane
waves. Due to choice of plane wave expansion, all integration in the
mode-matching process is carried out analytically. The scattering matrices of
the regions are combined using a generalized scattering matrix technique to
obtain the scattering matrix for the full geometry, and then the eigenmode
resonance frequencies and the fields. Periodic boundary condition is used for
the field calculation and the particle tracking.

analysis of interferometric experiments by Alley-Shih, Ou-Mandel and the
entanglement swapping experiment is performed. It is shown that the double- and
single-photon distinguishability is not necessary for the experiments to be
genuine tests against local realism. In the second part, basing on simple
geometrical properties of Hilbert space, new, stronger Bell inequalities for M
qubits in a maximally entangled state are derived. Application of the same
method to two maximally entangled qubits yields an inequality for all possible
positions of the local measuring apparatus. Finally, the series of the
Greenberger-Horne- Zeilinger paradoxes for M maximally entangled quNits
observed via symmetric unbiased 2N ports is derived. The last part of the
thesis is devoted to the numerical approach to the Bell theorem. The necessary
and sufficient conditions for the violation of local realism in the case of two

(two qubits) and up to 5 (three qubits) local measurements, are shown. It is
also numerically shown that in the case of two maximally entangled quNits (3 <
N < 9) a properly defined magnitude of violation increases with N. In both
cases the approach neither involves any simplifications, or additional
assumptions, nor does it utilise any symmetries of the problem.
