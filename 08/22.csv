effect of uncertainties in our knowledge of the structure of the galactic halo
on the WIMP annual modulation signal. We compare the signal for three
non-standard halo models: Evans' power-law halos, Michie models with an
asymmetric velocity distribution and Maxwellian halos with bulk rotation. We
then compare the theoretical predictions of these models with the experimental
signal found by the DAMA experiment and investigate how the WIMP mass and
interaction cross section determined depend on the halo model assumed. We find
that the WIMP mass confidence limits are significantly extended to larger
masses, with the shape of the allowed region in the mass-cross section plane
depending on the model.

long slit. Based on the 3D slicer concept with plane mirrors, an enhanced image
slicer was developed. The SPIFFI image slicer consists of two sets of mirrors,
called the 'small' and the 'large' slicer. The small slicer cuts a square field
of view into 32 slitlets, each of which is 32 pixels long. The large slicer
rearranges the 32 slitlets into a 1024 pixels long slit. The modifications to
the 3D slicer concept affect the angles of the plane mirrors of small and large
slicer and lead to an improved slit geometry with very little light losses. At
a mirror width of 0.3mm the light loss is <5%. All reflective surfaces are flat
and can be manufactured with a high surface quality. This is especially
important for the adaptive optics mode of SINFONI. We explain the concept of

increase in the intrinsic bolometric luminosity may result in a temporary
decrease in the difference between the gas and dust temperature and a
consequent decrease in the maser output. Whilst the latter effect can occur
over a period shorter than the thermal timescale, the former effect cannot.
Quantitative estimates of the response of the water maser emissivity to changes
in either the X-ray or bolometric luminosity are presented, together with
estimates of the relevant timescales. Either mechanism could account for recent
observations by Gallimore et al. which suggest that the water maser variability

general classes. The first comprises explosions of nearly pure carbon/oxygen
(C/O) white dwarfs at the Chandrasekhar limit which ignite near their centers.
The second consists of lower-mass C/O cores which are ignited by the detonation
of an accreted surface helium layer. Explosions of the latter type produce
copious Fe, Co and Ni K-alpha emission from 56Ni and 56Co decay in the
detonated surface layers, emission which is much weaker from Chandrasekhar-mass
models. The presence of this emission provides a simple and unambiguous
discriminant between these two models for SNe Ia. Both mechanisms may produce
0.1-0.6 solar masses of 56Ni, making them bright gamma-ray line emitters. The
time to maximum brightness of 56Ni decay lines is distinctly shorter in the
sub-Chandrasekhar mass class of model (approximately 15 days) than in the
Chandrasekhar mass model (approximately 30 days), making gamma-ray line
evolution another direct test of the explosion mechanism. It should just be
possible to detect K-shell emission from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion from SNe
Ia as far away as the Virgo cluster with the XMM Observatory. A 1 to 2 square

detecting anomalies near the peak amplification affected by the central caustic
from intensive monitoring of high amplification events (type II strategy). It
was shown by Griest & Safizadeh that the type II strategy yields high planet
detection efficiency per event. However, it is not known the planet detection
rate by this strategy can make up a substantial fraction of the total rate. In

collision of relativistic particles which form a relativistic microscopic

of phase for scalar fields. Then the wave of relativistic ""detonation"" similar

unidentified infrared (UIR) emission bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 $\mu$m.
The relative band intensities (6.2/7.7 $\mu$m, 8.6/7.7 $\mu$m, and 11.2/7.7

ratios was found in our observed regions, in spite of the fact that the
incident radiation intensity differs by a factor of 1500. Comparing our results
with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) model for the UIR band
carriers, PAHs in the DIM have no systematic variation in their size
distribution, their degree of dehydrogenation is independent of the strength of
UV radiation field, and they are mostly ionized. The latter finding is
incompatible with past theoretical studies, in which a large fraction of
neutral PAHs is predicted in this kind of environment. A plausible resolution
of this discrepancy is that the recombination coefficients for electron and
large PAH positive ion are by at least an order of magnitude less than those
adopted in past theoretical studies. Because of the very low population of
neutral state molecules, photoelectric emission from interstellar PAHs is
probably not the dominant source of heating of the diffuse interstellar gas.

different from the recently reported trend in NGC891 (Rand 1998). We find that

second ionization mechanism of the halo DIG (besides photoionization). This

divergence at the band center is studied and compared with Gade's result [Nucl.
Phys. B 398, 499 (1993)] and the powerlaw. Although Gade's form describes
accurately DoS of finite size systems near the band-center, it fails to
describe the calculated part of DoS of the infinite system, and a new

the state closest to the band center and the next one have different level
spacing distribution than the pairs of states away from the band center.
Multifractal properties of finite systems furthermore show that scaling of
eigenstates changes discontinuously near the band center. This unusual behavior
suggests the existence of a new divergent length scale, whose existence is
explained as the finite size manifestation of the band center critical point of
the infinite system, and the critical exponent of the correlation length is
calculated by a finite size scaling. Furthermore, study of scaling of Lyapunov
exponents of transfer matrices of long stripes indicates that for a long stripe
of any width there is an energy region around band center within which the
Lyapunov exponents cannot be described by one-parameter scaling. This region,
however, vanishes in the limit of the infinite square lattice when
one-parameter scaling is restored, and the scaling exponent calculated, in

quark-antiquark potential, we investigate two different spinorial forms (Dirac
structures), namely ${1/2}(\Id\otimes\Id - \gamma^0\otimes\gamma^0)$ as well as
the $U_A(1)$-invariant combination ${1/2}(\Id\otimes\Id -
\gamma^5\otimes\gamma^5 - \gamma^\mu\otimes\gamma_\mu)$, both providing a good
description of the ground state Regge trajectories up to highest observed
angular momenta. Whereas the first structure is slightly prefered concerning
numerous meson decay properties (see \cite{pap41}), we find the
$U_A(1)$-invariant force to be much more appropriate for the description of a
multitude of higher mass resonances discovered in the data of the {\sc Crystal
Barrel} collaboration during the last few years. Furthermore, this confinement
structure has the remarkable feature to yield a linear dependence of masses on
their radial excitation number. For many experimental resonances such a
trajectory-like behaviour was observed by Anisovich {\it et al.} We can confirm
that almost the same slope occurs for all trajectories. Adding the
$U_A(1)$-breaking instanton induced 't Hooft interaction we can compute the
pseudoscalar mass splittings with both Dirac structures and for the scalar
mesons a natural mechanism of flavour mixing is achieved. [...]

thousand, $\Delta m_{21}^2$ can be measured if it is greater than $4\times

these conclusions stand up to more detailed analysis, these experiments can be
done long before a muon storage ring source could be built, and at much less

that displays previously unnoticed hidden symmetries in 1T dynamical systems
and establishes previously unknown duality type relations among them. This may
play a role in displaying the symmetries and constructing the dynamics of
little understood systems, such as M-theory. 2T physics describes various 1T
dynamical systems as different d-dimensional ``holographic'' views of the same
2T system in $d+2$ dimensions. The ``holography'' is due to gauge symmetries
that tend to reduce the number of effective dimensions. Different 1T evolutions
(i.e. different Hamiltonians) emerge from the same 2T theory when gauge fixing
is done with different embeddings of d dimensions inside d+2 dimensions. Thus,
in the 2T setting, the distinguished 1T which we call ``time'' is a gauge
dependent concept. The 2T action has also a global SO(d,2) symmetry in flat
spacetime, or a more general d+2 symmetry in curved spacetime, under which all
dimensions are on an equal footing. This symmetry is observable in many 1T
systems, but it remained unknown until discovered in the 2T formalism. 2T
physics has mainly been developed in the context of particles, including spin
and supersymmetry, but some advances have also been made with strings and
p-branes, and insights for M-theory have already emerged. In the case of
particles, there exists a general worldline formulation with background fields,
as well as a field theory formulation, both described in terms of fields that
depend on d+2 coordinates. The Standard Model of particle physics can be

Kaluza-Klein black hole, using the null string expansion. The zeroth-order
string equations of motion are set up separately for electrically and
magnetically charged black hole backgrounds. The case of a string falling
head-on into the black hole is considered in detail. The equations reduce to
quadratures for a magnetically charged hole, while they are amenable to
numerical solution for an electrically charged black hole. The Kaluza-Klein
radius seen by the string as it approaches the black hole decreases in the
magnetic case and increases in the electric case. For magnetic backgrounds,
analytical solutions can be obtained in terms of elliptical integrals. These
reduce to elementary functions in special cases, including that of the
well-known Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole. Here the string exhibits
decelerated descent into the black hole. The results in the authors' earlier
papers are substantiated here by presenting a detailed analysis. A preliminary
analysis of first-order perturbations is also presented, and it is shown that
the invariant string length receives a nonzero contribution in the first order.

  We give several applications, to the probabilities that a set of prescribed
entries will appear in a set of prescribed cells of a tableau, and to the
probabilities that subtableaux of given shapes will occur.
  Our argument rests on a notion of quasirandomness of families of
permutations, and we give sufficient conditions for this to hold. We then
extend these results by finding an explicit formula for the limiting
probability that a Young tableau has a given set of entries in a given set of
positions. The result is that the limiting probability that a Young tableau has
a prescribed set of entries k_1,k_2,..., k_m in a prescribed set of m cells is
equal to the sum of the measures of all tableaux on K cells (K=\max{\{k_i\}})
that have the given entries in the given positions, where the measure of a

coupling constants. In order to confirm consistency with experimental data, we
calculate the cross-sections for photon-and pion induced reactions within a

mesons in nuclear matter are affected from the excitation of resonance-hole
