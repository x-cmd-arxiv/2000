systems in the Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS) and Cosmic Lens All-Sky
Survey (CLASS), and the possible implications for dark matter halo properties.
A simple lensing statistics model, which describes lens galaxies as singular
isothermal ellipsoids with a projected axis ratio distribution derived from the
surface brightness ellipticities of early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, is
ruled out at the 98% level since it predicts too few four-image lenses (quads).
We consider a range of factors that may be increasing the frequency of radio
quads, including external shear fields, mass distributions flatter than the
light, shallow lensing mass profiles, finite core radii, satellite galaxies,
and alterations to the luminosity function for faint flat-spectrum radio
sources. We find that none of these mechanisms provide a compelling solution to
the quad problem on their own while remaining consistent with other
observational constraints.

more than the estimated molecular mass within NGC 3077 itself. This implies
that interactions between galaxies can efficiently remove heavy elements and

describes the universe as having a three-phase evolution with a decelerating

that the universe is now in the latter phase. The theory is actually a
generalization of Hubble's law taking gravity into account by means of
Einstein's theory of general relativity. The equations obtained for the
universe expansion are elegant and very simple. It is shown, assuming
Omega_0=0.24, that the time at which the universe goes over from a decelerating
to an accelerating expansion, i.e. the constant expansion phase, occurs at
0.03tau from the big bang, where tau is the Hubble time in vacuum. Also, at
that time the cosmic radiation temperature was 11K. Recent observations of
distant supernovae imply, in defiance of expectations, that the universe growth
is accelerating, contrary to what has always been assumed that the expansion is
slowing down due to gravity. Our theory confirms these recent experimental
results by showing that the universe now is definitely in a stage of
accelerating expansion.

under debate. Parameterization of the viscous stress as $\alpha P$ proved to be
a successful representation of this mechanism in the outer parts of the disk,
explaining the dwarf novae and X-ray novae outbursts as due to ionization
instability. We show that this parameterization can be also adopted in the
innermost part of the disk where the adoption of the $\alpha$-viscosity law
implies the presence of the instability in the radiation pressure dominated
region. We study the time evolution of such disks. We show that the
time-dependent behavior of GRS 1915+105 can be well reproduced if
$\alpha$-viscosity disk model is calculated accurately (with proper numerical
coefficients in vertically averaged equations and with advection included), and
if the model is supplemented with (i) moderate corona dissipating 50% of energy
(ii) jet carrying luminosity-dependent fraction of energy. These necessary
modifications in the form of the presence of a corona and a jet are well
justified observationally. The model predicts outbursts at luminosity larger
than 0.16$\dot M_{Edd}$, as required, correct outburst timescales and
amplitudes, including the effect of increasing outburst timescale with mean
luminosity. This result strongly suggests that the $\alpha$-viscosity law is a
good description of the actual mechanism responsible for angular momentum
transfer also in the innermost, radiation pressure dominated part of the disk

noise component present up to a few tens of Hz, a low frequency quasi-periodic
oscillation (LFQPO) at frequencies between 20 and 40 Hz, a peaked noise
component around 100 Hz, and one or two QPOs at kHz frequencies. In addition to
these, in the lower banana (corresponding to softer energy spectra) we also
find a very low frequency noise (VLFN) component below ~1 Hz. In the upper
banana (corresponding to the softest energy spectra) the power spectra are
dominated by the VLFN, with a peaked noise component around 20 Hz. We find that
the frequencies of the kHz QPOs are well correlated with the position in the
X-ray color-color diagram. For the frequency of the LFQPO and the break
frequency of the broad-band noise component the relation appears more complex.
These frequencies both increase when the frequency of the upper kHz QPO
increases from 400 to 900 Hz, but at this frequency a jump in the values of the
parameters occurs. We interpret this jump in terms of the gradual appearance of
a QPO at the position of the break at high inferred mass accretion rate, while
the previous LFQPO disappears. Simultaneously, another kind of noise appears
with a break frequency of ~7 Hz, similar to the NBO of Z sources. The 100 Hz
peaked noise does not seem to correlate with the position of the source in the
color-color diagram, but remains relatively constant in frequency. This
component may be similar to several 100 Hz QPOs observed in black hole

  We have used molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate high-speed
deformation of copper crystals. Even though no pre-existing dislocation sources
are present in the initial system, dislocations are quickly nucleated and a
very high dislocation density is reached during the deformation.
  Due to the high density of dislocations, many inelastic interactions occur
between dislocations, resulting in the generation of vacancies. After the
deformation, a very high density of vacancies is observed, in agreement with
the experimental observations. The processes responsible for the generation of
vacancies are investigated. The main process is found to be incomplete
annihilation of segments of edge dislocations on adjacent slip planes. The
dislocations are also seen to be participating in complicated dislocation
reactions, where sessile dislocation segments are constantly formed and
destroyed.

atmospheric neutrino mass parameter region around \Delta m^2 ~3 10^-3 eV^2 and
to define the element U_{e3} of the neutrino mixing matrix (U_{e3}is the
contribution of the mass-3 state to the electron neutrino flavor state). The
practical goal of the project is to decrease, relative to the CHOOZ, the
statistic and systematic errors as much as possible. To achieve this we plan to
use two identical antineutrino detectors each with a ~50-ton liquid
scintillator target located at ~1100 m and ~250 m from the underground reactor
(~600 mwe). Much attention is given to the detector calibration and monitoring
procedures. As a first step we consider two much smaller pilot detectors each
of ~ a 3 ton target mass stationed at ~20 m and 35-60 m from the reactor. The
goals of this first stage are: (i) to accumulate necessary experience and (ii)
to investigate with electron neutrinos the LSND mass parameter region.

dependence on the quark and gluon energy, on the gluon transverse momentum, on
the in-medium pathlength and on the rescattering properties of the nuclear
medium is analyzed quantitatively. The two components of gluon radiation, the
hard vacuum radiation associated to the quark production vertex, and the
medium-induced rescattering contribution interfer destructively. For small
spatial extensions of the medium, this destructive interference overcompensates
the hard vacuum radiation, and the total medium-induced radiative energy loss
decreases proportional to L^3. Medium-induced gluon production dominates only
above a finite critical length which varies between 3 and more than 6 fm
depending on the rescattering properties of the medium. Deviations from the
BDMPS-L^2-behaviour persist above the critical length. The medium dependence of
the angular gluon distribution is dominated by Brownian transverse momentum
broadening. This results in a depletion of the low transverse momentum part of
both the hard and the medium-induced contribution. As a consequence, the
medium-induced energy loss outside a finite angular cone size can be more than
a factor two larger than the total medium-induced radiative energy loss. We
discuss implications of these results for the jet quenching signal in
relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.

of neutrino asymmetries from active-sterile neutrino oscillations. We
demonstrate that the approximate asymmetry evolution equation obtained therein
is an expansion, up to a minor discrepancy, of the well-established static
approximation equation, valid only when the supposedly new higher order
correction term is small. In the regime where this so-called ``back-reaction''
term is large and artificially terminates the asymmetry growth, their evolution
equation ceases to be a faithful approximation to the Quantum Kinetic Equations
(QKEs) simply because pure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) transitions have
been neglected. At low temperatures the MSW effect is the dominant asymmetry
amplifier. Neither the static nor the DHPS approach contains this important
physics. Therefore we conclude that the DHPS results have sufficient veracity
at the onset of explosive asymmetry generation, but are invalid in the ensuing
low temperature epoch where MSW conversions are able to enhance the asymmetry
to values of order $0.2 - 0.37$. DHPS do claim to find a significant final
asymmetry for very large $\delta m^2$ values. However, for this regime the
effective potential they employed is not valid.

facility at TRIUMF requires an 11.8 MHz buncher. The main requirements of the
buncher are to operate in cw mode with a velocity acceptance of 2.2% and an
effective voltage of 100 kV, which for a three gap buncher gives a drift tube
voltage of 30 kV. A lumped element circuit is more suitable than a distributed
rf structure for this low frequency of operation. The resonant frequency of
11.8 MHz is obtained by an inductive coil in parallel with the capacitance of
the drift tube. The coil is housed in a dust free box at atmospheric pressure
whereas the drift tube is placed in a vacuum chamber and an rf feedthrough
connects them. Two design of this feedthrough, one using disk and one using
tubular ceramics, operating at 30 kV rf, are described in this paper. MAFIA and
SUPERFISH codes are used to simulate the fields in the feedthroughs,
particularly around the ceramic metal interfaces. Test results of the prototype
feedthroughs are presented and the choice of the proposed final solution is
outlined.

  semiconductor materials in hadron fields","12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Radiation Measurements",,,,"physics.ins-det astro-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci hep-ex",,"  The utilisation of crystalline semiconductor materials as detectors and
devices operating in high radiation environments, at the future particle
colliders, in space applications, in medicine and industry, makes necessary to
obtain radiation harder materials. Diamond, SiC and different AIIIBV compounds
(GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs, InSb) are possible competitors for silicon to different
electronic devices for the up-mentioned applications. The main goal of this
paper is to give theoretical predictions about the behaviour of these
semiconductors in hadron fields (pions, protons). The effects of the
interaction between the incident particle and the semiconductor are
characterised in the present paper both from the point of view of the
projectile, the relevant quantity being the energy loss by nuclear
interactions, and of the target, using the concentration of primary radiation
induced defects on unit particle fluence. Some predictions about the damage
induced by hadrons in these materials in possible applications in particle
physics and space experiments are done.

atom radiating into a structured continuum is developed. The formal solution
for the atomic reduced density matrix is written as a Markovian algorithm by
introducing a set of additional, virtual density matrices which follow, to the
level of approximation of the algorithm, all the possible trajectories of the
photons in the electromagnetic field. The technique is perturbative in the
sense that more virtual density matrices are required as the product of the
effective memory time and the effective coupling strength become larger. The
number of density matrices required is given by $3^{M}$ where $M$ is the number
of timesteps per memory time. The technique is applied to the problem of a
driven two-level atom radiating close to a photonic band gap and the
steady-state correlation function of the atom is calculated.

random variable f(X), where X is uniformly random in f's domain. Our main
result is that it takes \Omega(E(f)) queries to compute any \emph{total}

\Omega(E(f)/log(n)) bound, which is tight for \emph{partial} functions. Our
approach is the polynomial method.

(Welcher-Weg) experiment in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Although a
Welcher-Weg measurement can be performed with only a negligible amount of
momentum change in the detector itself, the change in the interference pattern
must correspond to a change in the momentum distribution of the particle.
Entanglement between the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the Welcher-Weg
measurement introduces orthogonality that disables the interference of the
particle, but simultaneously, it also generates a momentum transfer between the
particle and other parts of the whole entangled system (including macroscopic
parts). This analysis can be related to the Delayed Choice interpretation. We
show where the momentum change takes place and we conclude that entanglement is
the key to understand how complementarity (i.e. Which Way versus interference)
and the position-momentum uncertainty relation are interwoven.

  Millenium"" edited by Cristian Calude. Email: summhammer@ati.ac.at",,,,"quant-ph",,"  As physics searches for invariants in observations, this paper looks for
invariants of probabilistic observation without assuming physical structure.
Structure emerges from the basic assumption of science that new information
shall lead to more accurate knowledge of the invariants. This leads to
statistically unique random variables for expressing observed information:
Complex probability amplitudes. Predictions are also just random variables
computed from observed data, and must become more accurate with more
observations as input. This singles out the quantum mechanical superposition
principle. The external conditions of a probabilistic experiment can themselves
be monitored at the most detailed level, resulting in observation of coicidence
probabilities. The invariants of any multi-coincidence experiment are the same
as those of a one-event experiment with the same number of possible outcomes.
An observable probability turns out to be controllable by two independent
experimental conditions, naturally parametrized as a direction in a
3-dimensional space. In summary, the probabilistic paradigm itself defines a
unique method of forming concepts and making predictions. The method appears
irrefutable within probability, because, whenever a prediction turns out wrong
the existence of an as yet unmonitored condition is postulated, and a formal
way to incoroporate it is shown. The Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory
seems to be isomorphic to this method.
