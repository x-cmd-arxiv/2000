photometry of at least two black hole X-ray transients (SXTs). As in extreme
mass-ratio cataclysmic variables (CVs), superhumps are assumed to result from
the presence of the 3:1 orbital resonance in the accretion disc. This causes
the disc to become non-axisymmetric and precess. However the mechanism for
superhump luminosity variations in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) must differ
from that in CVs, where it is attributed to a tidally-driven modulation of the
disc's viscous dissipation, varying on the beat between the orbital and disc
precession period. By contrast in LMXBs, tidal dissipation in the outer
accretion disc is negligible: the optical emission is overwhelming dominated by
reprocessing of intercepted central X-rays. Thus a different origin for the
superhump modulation is required. Recent observations and numerical simulations
indicate that in an extreme mass-ratio system the disc area changes on the
superhump period. We deduce that the superhumps observed in SXTs arise from a
modulation of the reprocessed flux by the changing area. Therefore, unlike the
situation in CVs, where the superhump amplitude is inclination-independent,
superhumps should be best seen in low-inclination LMXBs, whereas an orbital
modulation from the heated face of the secondary star should be more prominent
at high inclinations. Modulation at the disc precession period (10s of days)
may indicate disc asymmetries such as warping. We comment on the orbital period
determinations of LMXBs, and the possibility and significance of possible
permanent superhump LMXBs.

velocity, hence the dynamical mass. Since the disk mass is usually small, this
is a direct measurement of the stellar mass. Typically, we reach an internal
precision of 10% in the determinations of stellar mass. The over-all accuracy
is limited by the uncertainty in the distance to a specific star. In a distance
independent way, we compare the derived masses with theoretical tracks of
pre-main-sequence evolution. Combined with the mean distance to the Taurus

the tracks with cooler photospheres (higher masses for a given spectral type).

short-period Jovian mass objects around a fraction (5 to 10%) of nearby G
stars. Although we expect Jovian planets to be located in long-period orbits of
decades or longer (if our solar system is any guide), detecting such planets
with RV technique is difficult due to smaller velocity amplitudes and the
limited temporal baseline (5-10 yr) of current searches relative to the
expected orbital periods. In this paper, we develop an analytical understanding
of the sensitivity of RV technique in the regime where the the orbital period
is larger than the total baseline of the survey. Moreover, we focus on the
importance of the orbital phase in this ``long-period'' regime, and develop a
Least Squares detection technique based on the amplitude and phase of the
fitted signal.
  To illustrate the benefits of this amplitude-phase analysis, we compare it to
existing techniques. Previous authors (e.g. Nelson & Angel 1998) have explored
the sensitivity of an amplitude-only analysis using Monte Carlo simulations.
Others have supplemented this by using the slope of the linear component of the
fitted sinusoid in addition (e.g. Walker et al. 1995; Cumming et al. 1999). In

stable than the most stable atomic nucleus, iron. In the latter event, neutron
stars would be largely composed of pure quark matter, eventually enveloped in a
thin nuclear crust. No matter which physical processes are actually realized
inside neutron stars, each one leads to fingerprints, some more pronounced than
others though, in the observable stellar quantities. This feature combined with
the unprecedented progress in observational astronomy, which allows us to see

neutron stars to nearly ideal probes for a wide range of physical studies,

  $\xipk(\theta)$, in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. The lensing
effect depends on the projected mass fluctuations between today and the
redshift $z_{\rm rec}\approx1100$. If adopting the Gaussian assumption for the
primordial temperature fluctuations field, the peak statistics can provide an
additional information about the intrinsic distribution of hotspots that those
pairs have some characteristic separation angles. The weak lensing then
redistributes hotspots in the observed CMB maps from the intrinsic distribution
and consequently imprints non-Gaussian signatures onto $\xipk(\theta)$.
Especially, since the intrinsic $\xipk(\theta)$ has a pronounced depression
feature around the angular scale of $\theta\approx 70'$ for a flat universe,
the weak lensing induces a large smoothing at the scale. We show that the
lensing signature therefore has an advantage to effectively probe mass
fluctuations with large wavelength modes around $\lambda\approx 50 h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}$. To reveal the detectability, we performed numerical experiments with
specifications of {\em MAP} and {\em Planck Surveyor} including the
instrumental effects of beam smoothing and detector noise. It is then found
that our method can successfully provide constraints on amplitude of the mass

turbulent pressure support for the required scale height. However, an improved

redshift. Our model is summarized as follows. Step I: Successive merging of
subgalactic gas clumps results in the formation of a galaxy with a mass of
$10^{11-12} M_\odot$ at redshift $z \sim 5$. Step II: Subsequently, supernova
explosions occur inside the galaxy and then blow out as a galactic wind (or a
superwind). This wind expands into the intergalactic space and then causes a
large-scale shell with a radius of several hundreds of kpc. Since this radius
may be smaller than the typical separation between galaxies, interactions of
shells may also occur, resulting in the formation of a large-scale gaseous
slab. Step III: Since the shell or the slab can be regarded as a gaseous sheet,
filament-like gravitational instability is expected to occur. Step IV: Further
gravitational instability occurs in each filament, leading to intense star
formation along the filament. This is the chain galaxy phase. Step V: The
filament collapses gravitationally into one spheroidal system like an
elliptical galaxy within one dynamical timescale of the filament ($\sim 10^8$
yr). Therefore, it seems quite difficult to find remnants of chain galaxies. We
also discuss that shocked shells driven by superwinds may be responsible for
some Lyman limit systems and damped Ly$\alpha$ systems because their H {\sc i}
column densities are expected to be $N_{\rm HI} \gtrsim 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$.

with those derived from moderate-resolution follow-up spectra. HE 1353--2735 is
a double-lined spectroscopic binary.
  The two stars nicely reproduce the strong scatter in [Sr/Fe] observed for
extremely metal-poor stars. While we see a strong Sr II $\lambda 4215$ {\AA}
line in the spectrum of HE 1303--2708 ([Sr/Fe]=-0.08), we can only give an
upper limit for HE 1353--2735 ([Sr/Fe]<-1.2), since the line is not detected.
We report abundances of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr for both stars, and Co, Y for
respect to known trends for metal-poor stars.Lithium is also detected in these

Physical distances are of fundamental importance in the applications to real

formulation. Here we introduce a new concept, the connectivity length D, that
gives harmony to the whole theory. D can be evaluated on a global and on a
local scale and plays in turn the role of L and 1/C. Moreover it can be
computed for any metrical network and not only for the topological cases. D has
a precise meaning in term of information propagation and describes in an
unified way both the structural and the dynamical aspects of a network:
small-worlds are defined by a small global and local D, i.e. by a high
efficiency in propagating information both on a local and on a global scale.

taking into account fluctuations of the exciton energy which are expected to

applied to magneto-optical studies of CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te single quantum well
heterostructures containing a two-dimensional electron gas. By the analysis of
excitonic reflection spectra in magnetic fields the parameters of homogeneous

deep in the massive object's strong field, so the gravitational waves that they

The final order of magnitude of the lepton asymmetry \eta is mainly determined
by its growth in the last stage of evolution, the so called power-law regime.
There exist two contradictory results in the literature, \eta \propto T^{-1}
and \eta \propto T^{-4}, where T is the background medium temperature. In the
first case, the lepton asymmetry does not exceed values of 10^{-4} for |\delta
m^2| < 1 eV^2, while in the second case it can become larger than 10^{-1}. In
this work we analytically investigate the case \eta \propto T^{-1}, using a new

which are quantum homogeneous spaces with coactions of the quantum groups
O_q(N).
  The first part of the paper is devoted to first order differential calculus.
A classification result is proved which says that for N>=6 there exist exactly
two covariant first order differential calculi on S_q^{N-1} which satisfy the
classification constraint that the bimodule of one-forms is generated as a free
left module by the differentials of the generators of S_q^{N-1}. Both calculi
exist also for 3<=N<=5. The same calculi can be constructed using a method
introduced by Hermisson. In case N=3, the result is in accordance with the
known result by Apel and Schm\""udgen for the Podles sphere.
  In the second part, higher order differential calculus and symmetry are
treated. The relations which hold for the two-forms in the universal higher
order calculus extending one of the two first order calculi are given. A
""braiding"" homomorphism is found. The existence of an upper bound for the order
of differential forms is discussed.

studied: the circular hydraulic jump and the flow down an inclined plane. For
the circular hydraulic jump our method is able to handle an internal eddy and
separated flow. Assuming a variable radial velocity profile like in
Karman-Pohlhausen's method, we obtain a system of two ordinary differential
equations for stationary states that can smoothly go through the jump where
previous studies encountered a singularity. Solutions of the system are in good
agreement with experiments. For the flow down an inclined plane we take a
similar approach and derive a simple model in which the velocity profile is not
restricted to a parabolic or self-similar form. Two types of solutions with
large surface distortions are found: solitary, kink-like propagating fronts,
obtained when the flow rate is suddenly changed, and stationary jumps,
obtained, e.g., behind a sluice gate. We then include time-dependence in the
model to study stability of these waves. This allows us to distinguish between
sub- and supercritical flows by calculating dispersion relations for
wavelengths of the order of the width of the layer.
