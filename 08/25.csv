of AGN at z=1 through the detection of variable galaxy nuclei. The advantage of
HST is the ability to do accurate photometry within smaller apertures, thus
allowing us to probe much lower AGN/host galaxy luminosity ratios than can be
done from the ground. The primary data sets analyzed for galactic variability
follow from the original HDF-N observations in December 1995 and a second epoch
obtained two years later.
  We have detected nuclear variability at or above the 3 sigma level in 8 of
633 HDF galaxies at I<27. Only 2 detections would be expected by chance in a
normal distribution. At least one of these 8 has been spectroscopically
confirmed as a Seyfert 1 galaxy. Based on the AGN structure function for
variability, the estimated luminosity of the varying component in each galaxy
lies in the range -19.5<M<-15.0. We construct an upper limit to the luminosity
function for the variable nuclei and compare this to the local Seyfert LF and
the LF for QSOs at z=1. Assuming we have detected all Seyfert-like nuclei in
the HDF-N, we find no evidence for an increase in the number density of AGN at
M=-19. We estimate that ~1-3% of field galaxies with I<27 may contain a nuclear
AGN.

kaon-condensed matter might exist, including the effects of finite temperature
and trapped neutrinos. The phase transition from pure nucleonic matter to the
kaon condensate phase is described using Gibbs' rules for phase equilibrium,
which permit the existence of a mixed phase. A general property of neutron
stars containing kaon condensates, as well as other forms of strangeness, is
that the maximum mass for cold, neutrino-free matter can be less than the
maximum mass for matter containing trapped neutrinos or which has a finite
entropy. A proto-neutron star formed with a baryon mass exceeding that of the
maximum mass of cold, neutrino-free matter is therefore metastable, that is, it
will collapse to a black hole at some time during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling
stage.
  The effects of kaon condensation on metastable stars are dramatic. In these
cases, the neutrino signal from a hypothetical galactic supernova (distance
$\sim8.5$ kpc) will stop suddenly, generally at a level above the background in
the SuperK and SNO detectors, which have low energy thresholds and backgrounds.
This is in contrast to the case of a stable star, for which the signal
exponentially decays, eventually disappearing into the background. We find the
lifetimes of kaon-condensed metastable stars to be restricted to the range
40--70 s and weakly dependent on the proto-neutron star mass, in sharp contrast
to the significantly larger mass dependence and range (1--100 s) of
hyperon-rich metastable stars.

detected in any of the observed positions. We use a full shock code to diagnose
shock velocities vs~100 km/s toward the HH objects, as expected from the

the [CII]158um line is everywhere brighter than the [OI]63um line, indicating

emission from the HH objects and from other positions along the flow is only

the instrument response function, which accounts for an enhanced equivalent
width of the line by folding some of the continuum radiation in with the

the electron sees an uniform field parallel to the interface as a random
perpendicular field. At zero parallel field the dependence of the conductance
on the perpendicular field has a well known form, the weak-localization
lineshape. Here the effect of applying a fixed parallel field on the lineshape
is analyzed. Many types of behavior are found including homogeneous broadening,
inhomogeneous broadening and a remarkable regime in which the change in

D63 (2001) 064013","10.1103/PhysRevD.63.064013",,"gr-qc",,"  It is well known that, when an external general relativistic (electric-type)
tidal field E(t) interacts with the evolving quadrupole moment I(t) of an
isolated body, the tidal field does work on the body (``tidal work'') -- i.e.,
it transfers energy to the body -- at a rate given by the same formula as in
Newtonian theory: dW/dt = -1/2 E dI/dt. Thorne has posed the following
question: In view of the fact that the gravitational interaction energy between
the tidal field and the body is ambiguous by an amount of order E(t)I(t), is
the tidal work also ambiguous by this amount, and therefore is the formula
dW/dt = -1/2 E dI/dt only valid unambiguously when integrated over timescales
long compared to that for I(t) to change substantially? This paper completes a
demonstration that the answer is no; dW/dt is not ambiguous in this way. More
specifically, this paper shows that dW/dt is unambiguously given by -1/2 E
dI/dt independently of one's choice of how to localize gravitational energy in
general relativity. This is proved by explicitly computing dW/dt using various
gravitational stress-energy pseudotensors (Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Moller)
as well as Bergmann's conserved quantities which generalize many of the
pseudotensors to include an arbitrary function of position. A discussion is
also given of the problem of formulating conservation laws in general

are extended to the gravity-induced non-renormalizable operators as well. We
show explicitly that within the supergravity-mediated supersymmetry-breaking

presence of the gauge singlet first appear at loop levels higher than 5 and
therefore do not destabilize the gauge hierarchy. The model provides a natural
explanation for the origin of the $\mu$-term, without suffering from the

its effective Higgs potential by integrating out the dominant quantum effects

models with minimal flavour violation (MFV), that do not have any new operators
beyond those present in the Standard Model and in which all flavour changing
transitions are governed by the CKM matrix with no new phases beyond the KM
phase. This bound depends only on V_{cb}, V_{ub} and the hadronic parameters
\hat B_K, F_{B_d}\sqrt{\hat B_d} and \xi relevant for the CP-violating
parameter \varepsilon and the B^0_{d,s}-\bar B^0_{d,s} mixings. Performing a
simple scanning over the present ranges of these parameters we find sin
2\beta\ge 0.34. We illustrate how this bound could become stronger when our
knowledge of the parameters in question improves and when the upper bound on
the B^0_{s}-\bar B^0_{s} mixing ((\Delta M)_s) will be experimentally known.
Provided the future accurate measurements of sin 2\beta through the CP
asymmetry in B_d^0(\bar B_d^0)\to \psi K_S will confirm the low values recently
reported by BaBar and Belle, there is a likely possibility that this class of
models will be excluded. This would firmly imply the necessity of new
CP-violating phases and/or new effective operators in the weak effective
Hamiltonians for K^0-\bar K^0 and B^0_{d,s}-\bar B^0_{d,s} mixings. We also
point out that within the MFV models there exists also an absolute lower bound
on the angle \gamma. We find \sin\gamma\ge 0.24. This lower bound could become

brane propagation along the fifth direction. We have then considered testable

perturbations whose amplitude can be naturally accommodated to the required
value 10$^{-5}-10^{-6}$, and a power spectrum of CMB anisotropies whose
acoustic peaks are at the same sky angles as those predicted by inflationary

dimensions is affine Toda theory. Distinguished by a rich underlying Lie
algebraic structure these models have in recent years attracted much attention
not only as test laboratories for non-perturbative methods in quantum field
theory but also in the context of off-critical models. After a short
introduction the mathematical preliminaries such as root systems, Coxeter
geometry, dual algebras, q-deformed Coxeter elements and q-deformed Cartan
matrices are introduced. Using this mathematical framework the bootstrap
analysis of the affine Toda S-matrices with real coupling is performed and
several universal Lie algebraic formulae proved. The Lie algebraic methods are
then extended to define a new class of colour valued S-matrices and also here
universal expressions are derived. The second part of the thesis presents a
detailed analysis of the high-energy regime of the integrable models discussed
in the first part. By means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz the central
charges of the ultraviolet conformal field theories are calculated and in case
of affine Toda theories also the first order term in the scaling function is
analytically obtained. For the colour valued S-matrices the connection to WZNW
coset models is discussed. A particular subclass of them, the so-called
Homogeneous Sine-Gordon models, is investigated in some detail and it is found
that the presence of unstable particles in these theories gives rise to a
staircase pattern in the corresponding scaling function. This thesis summarizes
the results of previously published articles listed in the introduction.

VSASMs (vertically symmetric ASMs), even HTSASMs (half-turn-symmetric ASMs),
and even QTSASMs (quarter-turn-symmetric ASMs). The VSASM enumeration was
conjectured by Mills; the others by Robbins [math.CO/0008045]. We introduce
several new types of ASMs: UASMs (ASMs with a U-turn side), UUASMs (two U-turn
sides), OSASMs (off-diagonally symmetric ASMs), OOSASMs (off-diagonally,
off-antidiagonally symmetric), and UOSASMs (off-diagonally symmetric with
U-turn sides). UASMs generalize VSASMs, while UUASMs generalize VHSASMs
(vertically and horizontally symmetric ASMs) and another new class, VHPASMs
(vertically and horizontally perverse). OSASMs, OOSASMs, and UOSASMs are
related to the remaining symmetry classes of ASMs, namely DSASMs (diagonally
symmetric), DASASMs (diagonally, anti-diagonally symmetric), and TSASMs
(totally symmetric ASMs). We enumerate several of these new classes, and we
provide several 2-enumerations and 3-enumerations.
  Our main technical tool is a set of multi-parameter determinant and Pfaffian
formulas generalizing the Izergin-Korepin determinant for ASMs and the Tsuchiya
determinant for UASMs [solv-int/9804010]. We evaluate specializations of the
determinants and Pfaffians using the factor exhaustion method.

coherence spectroscopy in the well separated pulse limit. The treatment
presented here is based on a displaced and squeezed state representation for
the non-stationary states induced by an ultrashort pump laser pulse or a
chemical reaction. The subsequent response of the system to a delayed probe
pulse is modeled using closed form non-stationary linear response functions,
valid for a multimode vibronically coupled system at arbitrary temperature.
When pump-probe signals are simulated using the linear response functions, with
the mean nuclear positions and momenta obtained from a rigorous moment analysis
of the pump induced (doorway) state, the signals are found to be in excellent
agreement with the conventional third order response approach. The key
advantages offered by the moment analysis based linear response approach
include a clear physical interpretation of the amplitude and phase of
oscillatory pump-probe signals, a dramatic improvement in computation times, a
direct connection between pump-probe signals and equilibrium absorption and
dispersion lineshapes, and the ability to incorporate coherence such as those
created by rapid non-radiative surface crossing. We demonstrate these aspects
using numerical simulations, and also apply the present approach to the
interpretation of experimental amplitude and phase measurements on reactive and
non-reactive samples of the heme protein Myoglobin. The role played by
inhomogeneous broadening in the observed amplitude and phase profiles is
discussed in detail. We also investigate overtone signals in the context of
reaction driven coherent motion.

delineating the asymptotic regimes (Planck scale region and a smooth region of
a conventional point oscillator). In the most interesting Planck scale regime,
the solution reproduces in an elementary fashion the basic relations of string
theory (including string tension quantization). In addition, it is shown that
comparing the massive (super) string degeneracy with the p-loop degeneracy one
