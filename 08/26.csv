nonlinear power spectrum of PSCz shows a near power-law behaviour to the
smallest scales measured, with mild upward curvature in the broad vicinity of
1.5 h/Mpc. Contrary to the prediction of unbiased Dark Matter models, there is
no prominent inflection at the linear-nonlinear transition scale, and no
turnover at the transition to the stable clustering regime. The nonlinear power
spectrum of PSCz requires scale-dependent bias: all Dark Matter models without
scale-dependent bias are ruled out with high confidence.

different spectral slopes ($\alpha \sim$ 1.5 below 2keV and $\sim$ 0.5 above,

Comptonization from the innermost zone and the latter is due to a combination
of the Comptonization, bremsstrahlung and a reflection of the coronal radiation

M87 to search for intrinsic oxygen absorption similar to that recently measured
in several galaxies and groups. Using a spatial-spectral deprojection analysis
we find the strongest evidence to date for intrinsic oxygen absorption in the
hot gas of a galaxy, group, or cluster. Single-phase plasma models modified by
intervening Galactic absorption cannot fit the 0.2-2.2 keV PSPC data as they
under-predict the 0.2-0.4 keV region and over-predict the 0.5-0.8 keV region
where the emission and absorption residuals are obvious upon visual inspection
of the spectral fits. Since the excess emission between 0.2-0.4 keV rules out
intrinsic absorption from cold gas or dust, the most reasonable model for the
excess emission and absorption features is warm, collisionally ionized gas with
a temperature of ~10^6 K. Simple multiphase models (cooling flow, two phases)
modified by both intervening Galactic absorption and by a single oxygen edge
provide good fits and yield temperatures and Fe abundances of the hot gas that
agree with previous determinations by ASCA and SAX. The multiphase models of
M87 inferred from the PSPC can account for the excess EUV emission observed
with EUVE and the excess X-ray absorption inferred from EINSTEIN and ASCA data
above 0.5 keV. Although the total mass of the warm gas implied by the oxygen
absorption is consistent with the matter deposited by a cooling flow, the
suppression of the mass deposition rate and the distortion of the X-ray
isophotes in the region where the radio emission is most pronounced suggest
some feedback effect from the AGN on the cooling gas. (Abridged)

rate formula for a periodic overlayer with the coverage equal to the local
coverage in the island. The second part of the paper is devoted to facilitating

  printing problems",,,"Fermilab-fn-692","hep-ex hep-ph",,"  In response to the growing interest in building a Neutrino Factory to produce
high intensity beams of electron- and muon-neutrinos and antineutrinos, in
October 1999 the Fermilab Directorate initiated two six-month studies. The
first study, organized by N. Holtkamp and D. Finley, was to investigate the
technical feasibility of an intense neutrino source based on a muon storage
ring. This design study has produced a report in which the basic conclusion is
that a Neutrino Factory is technically feasible, although it requires an
aggressive R&D program. The second study, which is the subject of this report,
was to explore the physics potential of a Neutrino Factory as a function of the
muon beam energy and intensity, and for oscillation physics, the potential as a
function of baseline.

reflect general trends of unitarity limitations at high energies and are
realized within the chiral quark model with unitarization performed through the

in supersymmetric theories with and without R parity, in view of possible
experiments using an intense proton source as envisaged for a neutrino factory.
In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, such decays are generated by box
diagrams involving charginos and neutralinos, but the limits from \mu -> e
\gamma, \mu-e conversion and \Delta m_K constrain the branching ratios to
challengingly small values. However, this is no longer the case in R-violating
theories, where such decays may occur at tree level at rates close to the
present experimental limits. Within this framework, we obtain bounds on
products of LL\bar{E} and LQ\bar{D} operators from the experimental upper
limits on K^0 -> \mu^\pm e^\mp and K^{\pm,0} -> \pi^{\pm,0} \mu^\pm e^\mp
decays. We also note the possibility of like-sign lepton decays K^\pm ->
\pi^\mp \ell^\pm \ell^\pm in the presence of non-zero \tilde{b}_L-\tilde{b}_R
mixing. We conclude that rare kaon decays violating charged-lepton flavour
conservation could be an interesting signature of R violation.

Time-dependent currents in a lithographic conductor pattern create a moving

remaining confined in all three dimensions. We achieve fluxes up to 10^6 /s
with a negligible heating rate. An extension of this ``atomic conveyor belt''

Ioffe-Pritchard potentials. Under suitable conditions, the clouds merge without
loss of phase space density. We demonstrate this unification process
experimentally.

  analogical modeling and quantum computing",,,"QAM:rjs000825","quant-ph",,"  This paper serves as a bridge between quantum computing and analogical
modeling (a general theory for predicting categories of behavior in varying
contexts). Since its formulation in the early 1980s, analogical modeling has
been successfully applied to a variety of problems in language. Several
striking similarities between quantum mechanics and analogical modeling have
recently been noted: (1) traditional statistics can be derived from a
non-statistical basis by assuming data occurrences are accessed through a
spin-up state (given two equally probable quantum states, spin-up and
spin-down); (2) the probability of predicting a particular outcome is
determined by the squaring of an underlying linear measure and is the result of
decoherence (which occurs when a quantum system is observed); and (3) a natural
measure of certainty (called the agreement) is based on one chance of guessing
the right outcome and corresponds to the integrated squaring of Schroedinger's
wave equation.
  Analogical modeling considers all possible combiantions of a given context of
n variables, which is classical terms leads to an exponential explosion on the
order of 2**n. This paper proposes a quantum computational solution to this
exponentiality by applying a cycle of reversible quantum operators to all 2**n
possibilities, thus reducing the time and space of analogical modeling to a
polynomial order.
