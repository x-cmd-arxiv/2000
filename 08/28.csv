candidate GRS 1915+105 during 1999 June 6-17 from observations carried out with
the Pointed Proportional Counters of the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment on
board the Indian satellite IRS-P3. The observations were made after the source
made a transition from a steady low-hard state to a chaotic state which
occuered within a few hours. Dips of about 20-160 seconds duration are observed
on most of the days. The X-ray emission outside the dips shows a QPO at ~ 4 Hz
which has characteristics similar to the ubiquitous 0.5 - 10 Hz QPO seen during
the low-hard state of the source. During the onset of dips this QPO is absent
and also the energy spectrum is soft and the variability is low compared to the
non-dip periods. These features gradually re-appear as the dip recovers. The
onset of the occurrence of a large number of such dips followed the start of a
huge radio flare of strength 0.48 Jy (at 2.25 GHz). We interpret these dips as
the cause for mass ejection due to the evacuation of matter from an accretion
disk around the black hole. We propose that a super-position of a large number
of such dip events produces a huge radio jet in GRS 1915+105.

we have developed a quantitative two-parameter description of galactic
structure that maps closely on to Hubble's original tuning fork. Any galaxy can
be placed in this ""Hubble space"", where the x-coordinate measures position
along the early-to-late sequence, while the y-coordinate measures in a
quantitative way the degree to which the galaxy is barred. The parameters
defining Hubble space are sufficiently robust to allow the formation of
Hubble's tuning fork to be mapped out to high redshifts. In the present paper,
we describe a preliminary investigation of the distribution of local galaxies
in Hubble space, based on the CCD imaging atlas of Frei et al. (1996). We find
that barred, weakly-barred, and unbarred galaxies are remarkably well-separated
on this diagnostic diagram. The spiral sequence is clearly bimodal and indeed
approximates a tuning fork: strongly-barred and unbarred spirals do not simply
constitute the extrema of a smooth unimodal distribution of bar strength, but
rather populate two parallel sequences. Strongly barred galaxies lie on a
remarkably tight sequence, strongly suggesting the presence of an underlying
unifying physical process. Rather surprisingly, weakly barred systems do not
seem to correspond to objects bridging the parameter space between unbarred and
strongly barred galaxies, but instead form an extension of the regular spiral
sequence. This relation lends support to models in which the bulges of
late-type spirals originate from secular processes driven by bars.

existence of a compact emitting component within several Schwarzschild radii,
$r_S$, of the nucleus at the Galactic Center. This is interesting in view of
the predicted circularized flow within $\sim 5-10 r_S$, based on detailed
multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto this
unusual object. In this paper, we examine the physics of magnetic field
generation by a Keplerian dynamo subject to the conditions pertaining to Sgr
A*, and show that the sub-mm bump can be produced by thermal synchrotron
emission in this inner region. This spectral feature may therefore be taken as
indirect evidence for the existence of this circularization. In addition, the
self-Comptonization of the sub-mm bump appears to produce an X-ray flux
exceeding that due to bremsstrahlung from this region, which may account for
the X-ray counterpart to Sgr A* discovered recently by {\it Chandra}. However,
the required accretion rate in the Keplerian flow is orders of magnitude
smaller than that predicted by the Bondi-Hoyle simulations. We speculate that
rapid evaporation, in the form of a wind, may ensue from the heating associated
with turbulent mixing of gas elements with large eccentricity as they settle
down into a more or less circular (i.e., low eccentricity) trajectory. The
spectrum of Sgr A* longward of $\sim 1-2$ mm may be generated outside of the
Keplerian flow, where the gas is making a transition from a quasi-spherical
infall into a circularized pattern.

the brightest type 2 Seyfert nuclei. Our goal is to search for the direct
spectroscopic signature of massive stars, and thereby probe the role of
circumnuclear starbursts in the Seyfert phenomenon. The method used is based on
the detection of the higher order Balmer lines and HeI lines in absorption and
the Wolf-Rayet feature at $\sim$4680 \AA in emission. These lines are strong
indicators of the presence of young (a few Myrs) and intermediate-age (a few
100 Myrs) stellar populations. In over half the sample, we have detected HeI
and/or strong stellar absorption features in the high-order (near-UV) Balmer
series together with relatively weak lines from an old stellar population. In
three others we detect a broad emission feature near 4680 \AA that is most
plausibly ascribed to a population of Wolf-Rayet stars (the evolved descendants
of the most massive stars). We therefore conclude that the blue and near-UV
light of over half of the sample is dominated by young and/or intermediate age
stars. The ``young'' Seyfert 2's have have larger far-IR luminosities, cooler
mid/far-IR colors, and smaller [OIII]/H$\beta$ flux ratios than the ``old''
ones. These differences are consistent with a starburst playing a significant
energetic role in the former class. We consider the possibility that there may
be two distinct sub-classes of Seyfert 2 nuclei (``starbursts'' and ``hidden
BLR''). However, the fact that hidden BLRs have been found in three of the
``young'' nuclei argues against this, and suggests that nuclear starbursts may
be a more general part of the Seyfert phenomenon.

on Fundamental Plane (FP) distance estimates for early-type galaxies in each
cluster. We fit the FP using a maximum likelihood algorithm which accounts for
both selection effects and measurement errors, and yields FP parameters with
smaller bias and variance than other fitting procedures. We find a best-fit FP
with coefficients consistent with the best existing determinations. We measure
the bulk motions of the sample volumes using the 50 clusters with the
best-determined peculiar velocities. We find the bulk motions in both regions
are small, and consistent with zero at about the 5% level. The EFAR results are
in agreement with the small bulk motions found by Dale et al. (1999) on similar
scales, but are inconsistent with pure dipole motions having the large
amplitudes found by Lauer & Postman (1994) and Hudson et al. (1999). The
alignment of the EFAR sample with the Lauer & Postman dipole produces a strong
rejection of a large-amplitude bulk motion in that direction, but the rejection
of the Hudson et al. result is less certain because their dipole lies at a
large angle to the main axis of the EFAR sample. We find the bulk motion of our
sample is consistent with most cosmological models that approximately reproduce
the shape and normalisation of the observed galaxy power spectrum. We conclude
that existing measurements of large-scale bulk motions provide no significant
evidence against standard models for the formation of structure.

electron velocities of order the electron Alfven speed, and is directled along
magnetic field lines. Bremsstrahlung from these electrons produces the observed

  superconductivity","12 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Based on experimental results and our previous theoretical work, a
microscopic theory of high temperature superconductivity is conjectured. In
this conjecture, superconducting and antiferromagnetic long-range orders are
driven by interlayer coupling. Strictly in two dimensions, the microscopic
Hubbard model has an (resonating valence bond) insulator-to-metal transition at
$x=x_{c}$ near optimal doping for zero temperature, leading to a quantum
critical point, and one of the crossover lines is given by the pseudogap
temperature $T^{*}$. We argue that various singular and non-Fermi liquid
properties observed near optimal doping are due to the presence of this quantum
critical point. In our conjecture, the crossover line $T^{*}$ also practically
divides the superconducting region into two, depending on the doping level with
respect to $x_{c}$. For $x \leq x_{c}$ the superconducting state has
significant antiferromagnetic correlations, while for $x > x_{c}$ it has
virtually no antiferromagnetic correlations, thus justifying the conventional
BCS theory based on the noninteracting electrons. Inelastic neutron scattering
resonance and systematically reduced superfluid density in the superconducting
state below $x_{c}$ have their natural explanations in the present scenario.
The present approach supports interlayer pair tunneling model where the
superconducting condensation energy comes from the lowering of the c-axis
kinetic energy in the superconducting state. Comparison of the present scenario
with some of the leading theories based on the Hubbard and $t-J$ models is
given. The generic features of both hole-doped and electron-doped cuprates as
well as heavy-fermion superconductors may be understood in the {\em unified}
framework within the present picture.

waves in interferometric detector data. This method is designed to detect
short-duration (< 0.5 s) burst signals of unknown waveform, such as those from
supernovae or black hole mergers. If only the bursts' duration and frequency
band are known, the method is an optimal detection strategy in both Bayesian
and frequentist senses. It consists of summing the data power over the known
time interval and frequency band of the burst. If the detector noise is
stationary and Gaussian, this sum is distributed as a chi-squared (non-central
chi-squared) deviate in the absence (presence) of a signal. One can use these
distributions to compute frequentist detection thresholds for the measured
power. We derive the method from Bayesian analyses and show how to compute
Bayesian thresholds. More generically, when only upper and/or lower bounds on
the bursts duration and frequency band are known, one must search for excess
power in all concordant durations and bands. Two search schemes are presented
and their computational efficiencies are compared. We find that given
reasonable constraints on the effective duration and bandwidth of signals, the
excess power search can be performed on a single workstation. Furthermore, the
method can be almost as efficient as matched filtering when a large template
bank is required. Finally, we derive generalizations of the method to a network
of several interferometers under the assumption of Gaussian noise.

prerequisite we establish and prove a rather unexpected equivalence between the

intersection homology of U(1)-representation varieties on the one side and the
combinatorially constructed Hennings-TQFT based on the quasitriangular Hopf
algebra ${\cal N}=\Z/2\ltimes \ext *\R^2$ on the other side. We find that both
TQFT's are $SL(2,\R)$-equivariant functors and also as such isomorphic. The
$SL(2,\R)$-action in the Hennings construction comes from the natural action on
$\cal N$ and in the case of the Frohman-Nicas theory from the Hard-Lefschetz
decomposition of the U(1)-moduli spaces given that they are naturally K\""ahler.
The irreducible components of this TQFT, corresponding to simple
representations of $SL(2,\Z)$ and $Sp(2g,\Z)$, thus yield a large family of
homological TQFT's by taking sums and products. We give several examples of
TQFT's and invariants that appear to fit into this family, such as Milnor and
Reidemeister Torsion, Seiberg-Witten theories, Casson type theories for
homology circles \'a la Donaldson, higher rank gauge theories following Frohman
and Nicas, and the $\Z/r$ reductions of Reshetikhin-Turaev theories over the

nonzero total momentum of the condensate Cooper pairs. The quasiparticle
excitation spectrum is fourfold split compared to the usual BCS spectrum of the
symmetric, homogeneous matter. A twofold splitting of the spectrum into
separate branches is due to the finite momentum of the condensate, the isospin
asymmetry, or the finite quasiparticle lifetime. The coupling of the isospin
singlet and triplet paired states leads to further twofold splitting of each of
these branches. We solve the gap equation numerically in the isospin singlet
channel in the case where the pairing in the isospin triplet channel is
neglected and find nontrivial solutions with finite total momentum of the
pairs. The corresponding phase assumes a periodic spatial structure which
carries a isospin density wave at constant total number of particles. The phase
transition from the BCS to the inhomogeneous superconducting phase is found to
be first order and occurs when the density asymmetry is increased above 0.25.
The transition from the inhomogeneous superconducting to the unpaired normal
state is second order. The maximal values of the critical total momentum (in
units of the Fermi momentum) and the critical density asymmetry at which
condensate disappears are $P_c/p_F = 0.3$ and $\alpha_c = 0.41$. The possible

C62 (2000) 064003","10.1103/PhysRevC.62.064003",,"nucl-th",,"  A transformation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for N coupled channels
is presented, which allows the introduction of up to N degenerate bound states
without altering the remaining spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Phase equivalence
of the Hamiltonian can be restored by two successive supersymmetric
transformations at the same energy. The method is successfully applied to the
3S1-3D1 coupled channels of the nucleon-nucleon system and a set of Moscow-type
potentials is thus generated.

motion of a thin disk rolling without slipping on a horizontal surface, we
present results of simple experiment on the time dependence of the motion that
indicate the dominant dissipative power loss to be proportional to the Omega^2

roots in the 19th century efforts to understand the optics and electromagnetism
of moving bodies. These roots are reviewed in Parts 1 and 2, the latter being
specially devoted to the works of Lorentz and of Poincare up to 1904. Part 3
contains a detailed comparison of the works of Einstein and of Poincare in
1905. It is shown that both authors succeeded in constructing a coherent and
fully relativistic theory, although their ideas about the ether were radically
different. In Part 4, the question of the respective merits of the three
potential fathers of special relativity (i.e. Lorentz, Poincare, Einstein) is
discussed again, at the light of the preceding analysis and of the ""post-1905""
developments of the theory.

considered. It involves a global unitary dynamics of the system and periodic
actions of local bistochastic or decaying channel. For initially pure states
the decay of entanglement is accompanied with an increase of von Neumann
entropy of the system. We observe and discuss revivals of entanglement due to
unitary interaction of both subsystems. For some mixed states having different
marginal entropies of both subsystems (one of them larger than the global
entropy and the other one one smaller) we find an asymmetry in speed of
entanglement decay. The entanglement of these states decreases faster, if the
depolarizing channel acts on the ""classical"" subsystem, characterized by
smaller marginal entropy.
