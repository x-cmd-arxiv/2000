extracted all sources within 40' around UTR positions to find candidate

using the least squares method to find the best fit. We preferentially selected
radio counterparts whose radio spectrum extrapolated to low frequencies matched
the UTR decametric flux densities, and whose coordinates were close to the
gravity centre of UTR positions. Among all 1822 sources in the UTR catalogue we
found about 350 sources to be blends of two or more sources. As the most

can provide the energy for the supernova explosion of a massive star. This
neutrino-heating mechanism, however, is not finally accepted or proven as the

hydrodynamic models often hampers a clear and simple interpretation of the
results. This demands a deeper theoretical understanding of the requirements of
a successful shock revival. A toy model is presented here for discussing the
neutrino heating phase analytically by a time-dependent treatment, which allows
one to calculate the radius and velocity of the supernova shock from global
properties of the gain layer as solutions of an initial value problem. A
criterion is derived for the requirements of shock revival. It confirms the
existence of a minimum neutrino luminosity needed for shock expansion, but also
demonstrates the importance of a sufficiently large mass infall rate to the
shock. The possibility of very energetic neutrino-driven explosions seems
excluded because the total specific energy transferred to nucleons is limited
by about 1e52 ergs per solar mass (about 5 MeV per nucleon) and the total mass
in the gain layer is typically only around 0.1 solar masses. Energy transport
by convection from the region of maximum heating to radii closer behind the
shock is found to support the explosion by reducing the energy loss associated
with the inward advection of neutrino-heated matter through the gain radius.

Fokker-Planck (F-P) models, Kim, Morris, & Lee (1999) have made a survey of
cluster lifetimes for various initial conditions, and have found that clusters
with a mass <~ 2x10^4 Msun evaporate in ~10 Myr. These results were, however,
to be confirmed by N-body simulations because some extreme cluster conditions,
such as strong tidal forces and a large stellar mass range participating in the
dynamical evolution, might violate assumptions made in F-P models. Here we find
that, in most cases, the CYC lifetimes of previous F-P calculations are 5-30%
shorter than those from the present N-body simulations. The comparison of
projected number density profiles and stellar mass functions between N-body

selfconsistent calculations of the time dependence of the structure of the main

the possibility that even systems with rather small initial white dwarf masses

different metallicities, Z=0.02 and Z=0.001. We find that for systems with the
lower metallicity, the mass transfer rates are on average five times larger
than in comparable system at solar metallicity. This leads to a systematic
shift of the supernova Ia progenitor population. Firstly, while for Z=0.02
donor star initial masses in supernova progenitor systems are restricted to the
range 1.6...2.3 M_sun, they are in the interval 1.4...1.8 M_sun at low Z.
Secondly, the initial white dwarf masses need, on average, to be larger by 0.2
M_sun at low Z in order to obtain a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. This
metallicity dependences may be responsible for a drop of the Type Ia supernova
rate for low metallicity, and may introduce a Z-dependence in the properties of
supernovae. We also estimate the X-ray luminosities of the computed systems,

by a hard power-law spectrum and strong variability. All seven systems show a

spectra exhibited by most X-ray transients within days of outburst.
Furthermore, in none of the systems is a high-frequency cut-off to this
spectral component detected, and there is evidence that it extends to
near-infrared or optical regimes. Luminous persistent hard X-ray states in the
black hole system GRS 1915+105 produce a comparable spectrum. This spectral
component is considered to arise in synchrotron emission from a conical,
partially self-absorbed jet, of the same genre as those originally considered
for Active Galactic Nuclei. Whatever the physical origin of the Low/Hard X-ray
states, these self-similar outflows are an ever-present feature. The power in
the jet component is likely to be a significant (> 5%) and approximately fixed
fraction of the total accretion luminosity. The correlation between hard X-ray
and synchrotron emission in all the sources implies that the jets are
intimately related to the Comptonisation process, and do not have very large
bulk Lorentz factors, unless the hard X-ray emission is also beamed by the same
factor.

However, here we have investigated the possibility that much more massive

subhaloes in galaxy haloes and in galaxy cluster haloes, and compare the
effects of these processes on the subhalo abundance within both types of
haloes. N-body simulations with a resolution high enough not to suffer from
overmerging (subhalo disruption due to numerical processes) show a high
abundance of subhaloes in both galaxies and in galaxy clusters. However,
observations seem to show a high subhalo abundance in galaxy clusters only.
Thus, it appears that too many subhaloes survive in simulated galaxy haloes.
There are five main causes for this apparent galaxy subhalo problem. The most
radical one is a change to a cosmology in which structure formation is not
hierarchical below the galaxy halo mass scale. If this is unacceptable, four
causes remain, of which the most important one appears to be that dynamical
friction is not properly simulated yet, not even for the highest resolution
simulations to date, resulting in an 'undermerging' problem. The other causes
are (numerical) overmerging, differences in the timing of halo formation and
merging in hierarchical structure formation, and significant differences is
mass-to-light ratios. The net effect of these four causes is that galaxies have
a relatively low abundance of subhaloes, i.e. dwarfs, while at the same time a
large number of field dwarf galaxies can exist which are dark enough to be
missed observationally.

in three sets of snapshots with matched Mach numbers. The volume and column
densities are both log-normally distributed, with mean volume density a factor
3-6 times the unperturbed value, but mean column density only a factor 1.1-1.4
times the unperturbed value. We use a binning algorithm to investigate the
dependence of kinetic quantities on spatial scale for regions of column density
contrast (ROCs). The average velocity dispersion for the ROCs is only weakly
correlated with scale, similar to the mean size-linewidth relation for clumps
within GMCs. ROCs are often superpositions of spatially unconnected regions
that cannot easily be separated using velocity information; the same difficulty
may affect observed GMC clumps. We analyze magnetic field structure, and show
that in the high density regime, total magnetic field strengths increase with
density with logarithmic slope 1/3 -2/3. Mean line-of-sight magnetic field
strengths vary widely across a projected cloud, and do not correlate with

quite different characteristics from each other, with DI Lac showing narrow
Balmer emission cores situated in broad absorption troughs while V841 Oph
exhibits strong single-peaked Balmer, He I and He II emission lines. We find
little change between spectra obtained during different optical brightness
states. The X-ray count rates for both novae were very low (< ~1.5 ct/s) and
there was no reliable correlation between X-ray and optical brightness. The

Oph is too weak to allow model fitting. We discuss the possible origin of
variability in these old novae in terms of magnetic activity on the secondary

well excitons in a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that for

four-wave-mixing (FWM) polarization is dominated by the exciton-exciton
interaction effects. For repulsive interactions, we identify two regimes in the
time-evolution of the optical polarization characterized by exponential and
{\em power law} decay of the FWM signal. We describe these regimes by deriving
an analytical solution for the memory kernel of the two-exciton wave-function
in strong magnetic field. For strong exciton-exciton interactions, the decay of
the FWM signal is governed by an antibound resonance with an
interaction-dependent decay rate. For weak interactions, the continuum of
exciton-exciton scattering states leads to a long tail of the time-integrated
FWM signal for negative time delays, which is described by the product of a
power law and a logarithmic factor. By combining this analytic solution with
numerical calculations, we study the crossover between the exponential and
non-exponential regimes as a function of magnetic field. For attractive
exciton-exciton interaction, we show that the time-evolution of the FWM signal
is dominated by the biexcitonic effects.

  Osaka, Japan, 27 July - 2 August 2000. To appear in the Proceedings",,,"DESY 00-122, TUM-HEP-290/00","hep-ph",,"  As we pointed out recently, the neutral decays $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ and
$B_d\to\pi^0K$ may provide non-trivial bounds on the CKM angle $\gamma$. Here
we reconsider this approach in the light of recent CLEO data, which look very
interesting. In particular, the results for the corresponding CP-averaged
branching ratios are in favour of strong constraints on $\gamma$, where the
second quadrant is preferred. Such a situation would be in conflict with the
standard analysis of the unitarity triangle. Moreover, constraints on a
CP-conserving strong phase $\delta_n$ are in favour of a negative value of
$\cos\delta_n$, which would be in conflict with the factorization expectation.
In addition, there seems to be an interesting discrepancy with the bounds that
are implied by the charged $B\to\pi K$ system: whereas these decays favour a
range for $\gamma$ that is similar to that of the neutral modes, they point
towards a positive value of $\cos\delta_c$, which would be in conflict with the
expectation of equal signs for $\cos\delta_n$ and $\cos\delta_c$.

a parton picture as corresponding to the collision of two almost black disks
filled with partons. In this article we mainly concentrate on the examination
of the local transparency of such F-disks. We discuss how is it possible to
guarantee the boost-invariance of the reciprocal transparency of two such
F-disks in a process of their collision, despite the fact that the mean area of
the overlapping of these F-disks at the same impact parameter is varying with
the Lorentz frame. We argue that on will always have such problems, if the
dominant interactions at all energies remain soft, but such a trouble can be
probably avoided if the mean parton virtualities grow with energies. This last
is natural in QCD, and we use the qualitative generalization of BFKL approach
to estimate the distribution of hard partons with various virtualities inside a
F-disk. As a result, the quasiclassical partonic wave function corresponding to
the F-limit can be approximately represented by the system of enclosed
parton-gluon disks with a growing virtuality and blackness. With the increase
of energy the new disks with larger virtualities are created in the middle of
the previous disks, and then they expand with the same transverse velocity.
