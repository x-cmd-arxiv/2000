relativistic jet in 3C279, consisting of 18 epochs at 22 GHz from 1991 to 1997
and 10 epochs at 43 GHz from 1995 to 1997. Three major results of this study
are: apparent speeds measured for six superluminal components range from 4.8 to
7.5 c (H_{0}=70 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, q_{0}=0.1), variations in the total radio
flux are due primarily to changes in the VLBI core flux, and the uniform-sphere
brightness temperature of the VLBI core is about 1 x 10^{13} K at 22 GHz after
1995, one of the highest direct estimates of a brightness temperature. If the
variability brightness temperature measured for 3C279 by Lahteenmaki & Valtaoja
is an actual value and not a lower limit, then the rest-frame brightness
temperature of 3C279 is quite high and limited by inverse Compton effects
rather than equipartition. The parsec-scale morphology of 3C279 consists of a
bright, compact VLBI core, a jet component (C4) that moved from about 2 mas to
about 3.5 mas from the core during the course of our monitoring, and an inner
jet that extends from the core to a stationary component, C5, at about 1 mas
from the core. Components in the inner jet are relatively short-lived, and fade
by the time they reach about 1 mas from the core. The components have different
speeds and position angles from each other, but these differences do not match
the differences predicted by the precession model of Abraham & Carrara.
Although VLBI components were born about six months prior to each of the two
observed gamma-ray high states, the sparseness of the gamma-ray data prevents a
statistical analysis of possible correlations.

ordinary AGN, and are therefore perhaps more relevant to our understanding of
AGN phenomena and the relationship between AGN and host galaxies. Many normal
galaxies harbor LINER and starburst nuclei, which, together with LLAGN, are a
class of ``low-activity'' galaxies that have a number of surprisingly similar
X-ray characteristics, despite their heterogenous optical classification. This
strongly supports the hypothesis of an AGN-starburst connection. Further, X-ray
observations of normal galaxies without starburst or AGN-like activity in their
nuclei offer opportunities to study populations of X-ray binaries, HII regions,
and warm or hot ISM under different conditions than is often the case in the
Milky Way. The results of recent X-ray observations of these types of galaxies
are reviewed, and what we hope to learn about both nearby and high redshift
galaxies of each type from observations with forthcoming and planned satellites

is highly clustered and even sub-clustered, with a tendency of stronger
concentration for the younger regions. The improved samples of IR-excess YSOs
appear complete down to 0.03 L_sun for the most nearby clusters. This gives
constraints on the mass functions well into the brown dwarf domain. The first

  Revised version accepted to The Astrophysical Journal. The most important
  change from submitted manuscript is an expanded discussion of single-color UV
  excess and IR excess afterglow identification techniques",,"10.1086/321664",,"astro-ph",,"  Gamma ray burst afterglows can be identified in single epoch observations
using three or more optical filters. This method relies on color measurements
to distinguish the power law spectrum of an afterglow from the curved spectra
of stars. Observations in a fourth filter will further distinguish between
afterglows and most galaxies up to redshifts z ~ 1. Many afterglows can also be
identified with fewer filters using ultraviolet excess, infrared excess, or
Lyman break techniques. By allowing faster identification of gamma ray burst
afterglows, these color methods will increase the fraction of bursts for which
optical spectroscopy and other narrow-field observations can be obtained.
Because quasar colors can match those of afterglows, the maximum error box size
where an unambiguous identification can be expected is set by the flux limit of
the afterglow search and the quasar number-flux relation. For currently typical
error boxes (10 -- 100 square arcminutes), little contamination is expected at
magnitudes R < 21.5 +- 0.5. Archival data demonstrates that the afterglow of
GRB 000301C could have been identified using this method. In addition to
finding gamma ray burst counterparts, this method will have applications in
``orphan afterglow'' searches used to constrain gamma ray burst collimation.

evolution and constraining cosmological quantities. Any analysis of clusters,
however, is best done when one can reliably determine which galaxies are

difficulty in acquiring a complete sample of spectroscopic redshifts becomes
rather daunting, especially at high redshift where the background contamination
becomes increasingly larger. Traditionally, an alternative approach of applying
a statistical background correction has been utilized, which, while useful in a
global sense, does not provide information for specific galaxies. In this
paper, we develop a more robust technique which uses photometrically estimated
redshifts to determine cluster membership. This technique can either be used as
an improvement over the commonly used statistical correction method or it can
be used to determine cluster candidates on an individual galaxy basis. By
tuning the parameters of our algorithm, we can selectively maximize our
completeness or, alternatively, minimize our contamination. Furthermore, our
technique provides a statistical quantification of both our resulting
completeness and contamination from foreground and background galaxies.

outer layer of unburned CO and the formation of intermediate mass elements and
pockets of unburned CO near the center pose problems for the modeling of SNIa

velocity width is consistent with the line being produced in the outer

X-ray continuum was > than a factor 2 higher in the recent past before the

theory. Using this method, in which the effect of the magnetic field on the

the lowest order neutrino-electron interactions in a plasma. As an example of
the use of this technique, we explicitly calculate the rate at which neutrinos
and antineutrinos annihilate in a highly magnetized plasma, and compare that to
the rate in an unmagnetized plasma. The most important channel for energy
deposition is the gyromagnetic absorption of a neutrino-antineutrino pair on an
electron or positron in the plasma ($\nu\bar{\nu} e^\pm\leftrightarrow e^\pm$).
Our results show that the rate of annihilation increases with the magnetic
field strength once it reaches a certain critical value, which is dependent on
the incident neutrino energies and the ambient temperature of the plasma. It is
also shown that the annihilation rates are strongly dependent on the angle
between the incident particles and the direction of the magnetic field. If
sufficiently strong fields exist in the regions surrounding the core of a type
II supernovae or in the central engines of gamma ray bursts, these processes
will lead to more efficient plasma heating mechanism than in an unmagnetized
medium, and moreover, one which is intrinsically anisotropic.

distribution in galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges. The much smaller amount
of dust extinction at these wavelengths allows us to identify in almost all
target galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges an additional thin, central
component in cuts parallel to the major axis. This structure can be identified
with a bar. The length of this structure scaled by the length of the bulge
correlates with the morphologically classified shape of the bulge. This newly
established correlation is therefore mainly interpreted as the projection of
the bar at different aspect angles. Galaxies with peanut bulges have a bar seen
nearly edge-on and the ratio of bar length to thickness, 14 +/- 4, can be
directly measured for the first time. In addition, the correlation of the
boxiness of bulges with the bar strength indicates that the bar characteristic
could partly explain differences in the bulge shape. Furthermore, a new size
relation between the box/peanut structure and the central bulge is found. Our
observations are discussed in comparison to a N-body simulation for barred
galaxies (Pfenniger & Friedli 1991). We conclude that the inner region of
barred disk galaxies are build up by three distinct components: the spheroidal
bulge, a thin bar, and a b/p structure most likely representing the thick part
of the bar.

During this time the inner disc is maintained in a hot, ionised state. Using
these calculations, we interpret the long-term photometric variability of the
post nova V446 Her (Nova Her 1960) which shows today regular dwarf nova
outbursts. As the white dwarf in V446 Her continues to cool over the next

model of Marscher & Gear (1985), which is now able to describe an accelerating
or decelerating shock wave, in a curved, non-conical and non-adiabatic jet. The
model defines the properties of a synchrotron outburst which is expected to be
emitted by the jet material in a small region just behind the shock front. By a
proper parameterization of the average outburst's evolution and of the
peculiarities of individual outbursts, we are able to decompose simultaneously
thirteen long-term light-curves of 3C 273 in a series of seventeen distinct
outbursts. It is the first time that a model is so closely confronted to the
long-term multi-wavelength variability properties of a quasar. The ability of
the model to reproduce the very different shapes of the submillimetre-to-radio
light curves of 3C 273 gives strong support to the shock model of Marscher &
Gear (1985). Indirectly, it also reinforces the idea that the outbursts seen in

ask how reliable it could possibly be. In a two-dimensional, infinite lattice
model system one can calculate exact free energies by exhaustive enumeration. A
series of approximations were fitted to exact results to assess the feasibility
and utility of pair-wise free energy terms. Approximating the true free energy
with pair-wise interactions gives a poor fit with little transferability
between systems of different size. Adding extra artificial terms to the
approximation yields better fits, but does not improve the ability to
generalise from one system size to another. Further, one cannot distinguish
folding from non-folding sequences via the approximated free energies. Most
usefully, the methodology shows how one can assess the utility of various terms

The most important conclusion from this study is that distortions along the

reliable cluster model is found, distortion trends as a function of impurity,
alkali cation and halide anion are identified and discussed. These trends may
be useful when analycing other cation impurities in similar host lattices.

that act as projection operators onto the empty, singly occupied and doubly

distinguishes between processes that do conserve or do not conserve the total
number of doubly occupied sites. This allows for a systematic $t/U$ expansion
that does not break down at low temperature ($t$ being the intersite hopping
amplitude and $U$ the local Coulomb repulsion). The fermionic field becomes a
two-component field, which reflects the presence of the two Hubbard bands. The
single-particle propagator is naturally expressed as a function of a $2 \times
2$ matrix self-energy. Furthermore, by introducing a time- and
space-fluctuating spin-quantization axis in the functional integral, we can
expand around a ``non-degenerate'' ground-state where each singly occupied site
has a well defined spin direction (which may fluctuate in time). This formalism
is used to derive the effective action of charge carriers in the lower Hubbard
band to first order in $t/U$. We recover the action of the t-J model in the
spin-hole coherent-state path integral. We also compare our results with those
previously obtained by studying fluctuations around the large-$U$ Hartree-Fock
saddle point.

  Processing","PhD Thesis, 144 pages, University of Tuebingen, 1998",,,,"cs.CL",,"  In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and
algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in
constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called
quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical
framework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference
for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines
a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective
weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The
second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces
a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic
program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and
properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The
possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of
the log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate
parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary
context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these
ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the
correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the
problem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in
the inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this
task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for
the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.

from the Wulff shape (the ``local roughness'') is the inward deviation of the

been made for a wide class of interfaces in two dimensions. Specifically, the
average of the local roughness over the droplet surface is shown to be
O(l^{1/3}(\log l)^{2/3}) in probability, where l = \sqrt{A} is the linear scale

tilings can exhibit, and prove that almost all tilings lie within epsilon (for
an appropriate metric) of the unique entropy-maximizing solution. This gives a
solution to the dimer problem with fully general boundary conditions, thereby
resolving an issue first raised by Kasteleyn. Our methods also apply to dimer
models on other grids and their associated tiling models, such as tilings of
the plane by three orientations of unit lozenges.

following theorem: Suppose f(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and
consider the sum of 1/f^n(x) as n goes from 0 to infinity, where f^n denotes
the n-th iterate of f. This series has a continued fraction expansion over the
polynomials. The case when the partial quotients have integer coefficients is
particularly interesting, since then one can obtain simple continued fractions
when one substitutes integer values for x. In this case, the continued fraction
expansion is called specializable. We determine all polynomials f(x) such that
the sum of 1/f^n(x) has a specializable continued fraction: this holds iff f(x)

  Phys","Found.Phys. 31 (2001) 1545","10.1023/A:1012690715414",,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  Quantum theory does not only predict probabilities, but also relative phases
for any experiment, that involves measurements of an ensemble of systems at
different moments of time. We argue, that any operational formulation of
quantum theory needs an algebra of observables and an object that incorporates
the information about relative phases and probabilities. The latter is the
(de)coherence functional, introduced by the consistent histories approach to
quantum theory. The acceptance of relative phases as a primitive ingredient of
any quantum theory, liberates us from the need to use a Hilbert space and
non-commutative observables. It is shown, that quantum phenomena are adequately
described by a theory of relative phases and non-additive probabilities on the
classical phase space. The only difference lies on the type of observables that
correspond to sharp measurements. This class of theories does not suffer from
the consequences of Bell's theorem (it is not a theory of Kolmogorov
probabilities) and Kochen- Specker's theorem (it has distributive ""logic""). We
discuss its predictability properties, the meaning of the classical limit and
attempt to see if it can be experimentally distinguished from standard quantum
theory. Our construction is operational and statistical, in the spirit of
Kopenhagen, but makes plausible the existence of a realist, geometric theory
for individual quantum systems.

quantizing games, and applied their scheme to the famous game 'Battle of the
Sexes'. In this Comment we make two observations: (a) the overall quantization
scheme is fundamentally very similar to a previous scheme proposed by Eisert et
al., and (b) in contrast to a main claim of the paper, the quantum Battle of
the Sexes game does not have a unique solution - a similar dilemma exists in
both the classical and the quantum versions.
