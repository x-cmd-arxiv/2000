and a photometric analysis comparing the data with the predictions for a simple
two-stage star formation history is presented. The analysis shows that some of
the early-type galaxies may have fractions higher than 10% of the total mass
content in stars formed at z~0.5. An increased scatter is found in the
color-magnitude relation at the faint end, resulting in a significant fraction
of faint blue early-type systems. This would imply that less massive galaxies
undergo more recent episodes of star formation, and this can be explained in
terms of a positive correlation between star formation efficiency and

large-scale nonuniformities characteristic of the ongoing merger, in agreement
with earlier ASCA results. The brightness edge turns out to be a boundary of a
large cool gas cloud moving through the hot ambient gas, very similar to the
""cold fronts"" discovered by Chandra in A2142. The higher quality of the A3667
data allows the direct determination of the cloud velocity. At the leading edge
of the cloud, the gas density abruptly increases by a factor of 3.9+-0.8, while
the temperature decreases by a factor of 1.9+-0.2 (from 7.7 keV to 4.1 keV).
The ratio of the gas pressures inside and outside the front shows that the
cloud moves through the ambient gas at near-sonic velocity, M=1+-0.2 or
v=1400+-300 km/s. In front of the cloud, we observe the compression of the
ambient gas with an amplitude expected for such a velocity. A smaller surface
brightness discontinuity is observed further ahead, ~350 kpc in front of the

cloud velocity may be slightly supersonic. Given all the evidence, the cold
front appears to delineate the remnant of a cool subcluster that recently has

in the Chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density which
delineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocity
through the less dense, hotter gas. Without a magnetic field, the front should
be quickly disturbed by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arising from
tangential motion of gas layers. However, Chandra image shows that the front is
stable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyond
which it gradually disappears. We suggest that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
within the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magnetic
field whose field lines are parallel to the front. The required field strength
is B ~ 10 muG. Magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger and
have very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,
because the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. Such a
magnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasma
diffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixing
during the subcluster merger. We note that even the increased magnetic field
near the front contributes only 10-20% to the total gas pressure, and therefore
magnetic pressure is unimportant for hydrostatic cluster mass estimates.

giants and stars in the main sequence turn-off region in omega Centauri has
been used to analyse the apparently complex star formation history of this

been determined. These have been used to estimate ages of different
sub-populations in the color-magnitude diagram. The metal-poor population
around -1.7 dex is the oldest population found. More metal-rich stars between
[Fe/H]=-1.5 and -1.0 dex tend to be 1-3 Gyr younger. These stars are more
concentrated towards the center than the metal-poor ones. The most-metal rich
stars (-0.7 dex) might be up to 6 Gyr younger than the oldest population. They
are asymmetrically distributed around the center with an excess of stars
towards the South. We argue that the Stroemgren metallicity in terms of element
abundances has another meaning than in other globular clusters. From a
comparison with spectroscopic element abundances, we find the best correlation
with the sum C+N. The high Stroemgren metallicities, if interpreted by strong
CN-bands, result from progressively higher N and perhaps C abundances in
comparison to iron. We see an enrichment already among the metal-poor
population, which is difficult to explain by self-enrichment alone. An
attractive speculation is that omega Cen was the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. We
propose a scenario in which omega Cen experienced mass inflow over a long
period of time, until the gas content of its host galaxy was so low that star
formation in omega Cen stopped, or alternatively the gas was stripped off
during its infall in the Milky Way potential. A mass inflow occuringcn a clumpy

degree of apex fragmentation is also reduced. We show that the Coriolis force
slows the rise of the tube, and induces a retrograde flow in both the

variability of TeV Gamma--rays was similar to that observed in hard X-rays,

barred spiral galaxy NGC7479, known to be one of the few barred galaxies with a
continuous gas-filled bar. We focus on the investigation and interpretation of
12CO/13CO line intensity ratios, which is facilitated by having more than 90%
of the flux in our interferometer maps. The global (9kpc by 2.5kpc) value of
the 12CO/13CO ratio is high at 20 - 40. On smaller scales (~ 750 pc), the ratio
is found to vary dramatically, reaching values > 30 in large parts of the bar,
but dropping to values ~ 5, typical for galactic disks, at a 13CO condensation
in the southern part of the bar. We interpret these changes in terms of the
relative importance of the contribution of a diffuse molecular component,
characterized by unbound gas that has a moderate optical depth in the 12CO(1 -
0) transition. This component dominates the 12CO along the bar and is also
likely to play an important role in the center of NGC7479. In the center, the
12CO and the HCN intensity peaks coincide, while the 13CO peak is slightly
offset. This can be explained in terms of high gas temperature and density at
the 12CO peak position. Along the bar, the relation between the distribution of
12CO, 13CO, dust lanes and velocity gradient is complex. A southern 13CO
condensation is found offset from the 12CO ridge that generally coincides with
the most prominent dust lanes. It is possible that strong 13CO detections along
the bar indicate quiescent conditions, downstream from the major bar shock.
Still, these condensations are found close to high velocity gradients. In the
central region, the velocity gradient is traced much more closely by 13CO than
by 12CO.

flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) with respect to redshift and optical and
radio luminosity. We are able to clearly detect the host galaxy in 10 (53 %)
SSRQs and marginally in 6 (32 %) others, while the host remains unresolved in 3
(16 %) SSRQs. The galaxies hosting the SSRQs are large (average bulge
scale-length R(e) = 9.0+-1.7 kpc) and luminous (average M(H) = -27.2+-1.1).
They are, therefore, about 2 mag more luminous than the typical galaxy
luminosity L* (M*(H) = -25.0+-0.2), and about 1 mag more luminous than the
brightest cluster galaxies (M(H) = -26.3+-0.3). The SSRQ hosts appear to have
similar luminosity to those of the FSRQ hosts (M(H) = -27), and they fall
between the luminosities of lower redshift (M(H) = -26) and higher redshift
(M(H) = -29) radio-loud quasars. The average nucleus-to-galaxy luminosity ratio
of SSRQs (LN/LG = 3.8+-3.2) is much smaller than that found for the FSRQs
(LN/LG = 21+-11), in good agreement with the current unified models. We confirm
for the most luminous SSRQs the trend noted for the FSRQs between the host and
nuclear luminosity. This trend supports the suggestion based on studies of
lower redshift AGN, that there is a minimum host galaxy luminosity which
increases linearly with the quasar luminosity. Finally, FSRQs seem to reside in
richer environments than SSRQs, as evidenced by a larger number of close
companion galaxies.

of angular momentum is probably governed by MHD turbulence. In a non

of three basic time scales: The time interval between deposition events, the
residence time of atoms on the island, and the encounter time required for
$i^\ast + 1$ atoms forming a stable nucleus to meet. Application to the problem
of second-layer nucleation on growing first layer islands yields a sequence of
scaling regimes with different scaling exponents relating the critical island
size, at which nucleation takes place, to the diffusion and deposition rates.
Second layer nucleation is fluctuation-dominated, in the sense that the typical
number of atoms on the island is small compared to $i^\ast + 1$, when the first
layer island density exponent $\chi$ satisfies $\chi (i^\ast + 1) < 2$. The
upper critical nucleus size, above which the conventional mean-field theory of
second layer nucleation is valid, increases with decreasing dimensionality. In
the related case of nucleation on top of multilayer mounds
fluctuation-dominated and mean-field like regimes coexist for arbitrary values
of the critical nucleus size $i^\ast$.

stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes. We evaluate the
applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the

are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches. We find that
the folding routes obtained from only one contiguous folded region corresponds
to a chain with a much greater persistence length than appropriate for natural
protein chains, while the folding route obtained from two contiguous folded
regions is able to capture the relatively folded regions calculated within the
variational approach. The free energy profiles obtained from the contiguous
sequence approximations have larger barriers than the more microscopic
variational theory which is understood as a consequence of partial ordering.

Local reaction coordinates are identified as collective growth modes of the

description of the chain dynamics incorporates internal friction (independent
of the solvent viscosity) arising from the elementary isomerizations of the
backbone dihedral angles. We find that the folding rate depends linearly on the
solvent friction for high viscosity, but saturates at low viscosity because of
internal friction. For $\lambda$-repressor, the calculated folding rate
prefactor, along with the free energy barrier from the variational theory,
gives a folding rate that agrees well with the experimentally determined rate
under highly stabilizing conditions, but the theory predicts too large a
folding rate at the transition midpoint. This discrepancy obtained using a
fairly complete quantitative theory inspires a new set of questions about chain
dynamics, specifically detailed motions in individual contact formation.

axion wall which also contains an eta' transition. We argue that these domain
walls are topologically stable in the limit N_c->infinity and classically
stable for large but finite N_c, however, they can decay through a tunneling
process. We argue that the qualitative features of these QCD domain walls --
namely their classical stability -- persist to the realistic case of N_c=3 and
that it is at least possible that their lifetime could be macroscopically
large. If it is, then QCD domain walls could play an important role in the
evolution of early universe and may be detectable in energetic collisions such
as those at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).

These modes are spatially homogeneous in Lorentzian spacetime and thus not
relevant to density perturbations. But their properties are important in
establishing the meaning of the Euclidean path integral. If negative modes are
present, the Euclidean path integral is not well defined, but may nevertheless
be useful in an approximate description of the decay of an unstable state. When
gravitational dynamics is included, counting negative modes requires a careful
treatment of the conformal factor problem. We demonstrate that for an
appropriate choice of coordinate on phase space, the second order Euclidean
action is bounded below for normalized perturbations and has a finite number of
negative modes. We prove that there is a negative mode for many gravitational
instantons of the Hawking-Moss or Coleman-De Luccia type, and discuss the
associated spectral flow. We also investigate Hawking-Turok constrained
instantons, which occur in a generic inflationary model. Implementing the
regularization and constraint proposed by Kirklin, Turok and Wiseman, we find
that those instantons leading to substantial inflation do not possess negative
modes. Using an alternate regularization and constraint motivated by reduction
from five dimensions, we find a negative mode is present. These investigations
shed new light on the suitability of Euclidean quantum gravity as a potential
description of our universe.

electromagnetic form factors. The solutions used in were however not obtained
from solving exactly the LFD equations but by means of a perturbative
calculation with respect to the non relativistic wave function. Since, a
consequent effort has been made to obtain exact solutions of LFD equations. The
first results concerning J=0 states in a scalar model have been published in
nucl-th/9912050. The construction of $J \ne 0$ states in LFD is complicated by
the two following facts. First, the generators of the spatial rotations contain
interaction and are thus difficult to handle. Second, one is always forced to
work in a truncated Fock space, and consequently, the Poincar\'e group
commutation relations between the generators -- ensuring the correct properties
of the state vector under rotation -- are in practice destroyed. In the
standard approach, with the light-front plane defined as $t+z=0$, this
violation of rotational invariance manifests by the fact that the energy
depends on the angular momentum projection on $z$-axis.

Since the solution of the Poisson's equation is unique, our solution is exactly
the same as the one obtained by simply using the Green's function. The method
allows us to select much smaller region of mesh and therefore increase the
resolution of the solver. The better resolution makes more accurate the

both analytic and numerical methods. With the help of a stochastic model, a
metric is defined that enables the examination of a simulation in both the
ergodic and non-ergodic regimes. In the non-ergodic regime, the model implies
how the simulation is expected to approach ergodic behavior analytically, and
the analytically inferred decay law of the metric allows the monitoring of the
onset of ergodic behavior. The metric is related to previously defined measures
developed for molecular dynamics simulations, and the metric enables the
comparison of the relative efficiencies of different Monte Carlo schemes.
Applications to Lennard-Jones 13-particle clusters are shown to match the model
for Metropolis, J-walking and parallel tempering based approaches. The relative
efficiencies of these three Monte Carlo approaches are compared, and the decay
law is shown to be useful in determining needed high temperature parameters in

point of view. It is assumed that quantum states are relative, they depend on
and are defined with respect to some bigger physical system which contains the
former system as a subsystem. Hence, the bigger system acts as a reference
system. It is shown that quantum mechanics can be reformulated in accordance
with this new physical assumption. There is an important consequence of this
dependence: states may not be comparable, i.e., they cannot be checked by
suitable measurements simultaneously. This special circumstance is fully
reflected mathematically by the theory. Especially, it is shown that certain
joint probabilities (or the corresponding combined events) which play a vital
role in any proof of Bell's theorem do not exist. The conclusion is that the
principle of locality is fully valid in quantum mechanics, and one has to give
up instead of locality an intuitively natural-looking feature of realism,
namely, the comparability of existing states.

  via quantum coherence","4 pages, 1 Postscript figure, Revtex style. Replacement corrects a
  printing error in the authors field",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.63.053803",,"quant-ph",,"  A new scheme for infrared generation without population inversion between
subbands in quantum-well and quantum-dot lasers is presented and documented by
detailed calculations. The scheme is based on the simultaneous generation at
three frequencies: optical lasing at the two interband transitions which take
place simultaneously, in the same active region, and serve as the coherent
drive for the IR field. This mechanism for frequency down-conversion does not
rely upon any ad hoc assumptions of long-lived coherences in the semiconductor
active medium. And it should work efficiently at room temperature with
injection current pumping. For optimized waveguide and cavity parameters, the
intrinsic efficiency of the down-conversion process can reach the limiting
quantum value corresponding to one infrared photon per one optical photon. Due
to the parametric nature of IR generation, the proposed inversionless scheme is
especially promising for long-wavelength (far- infrared) operation.

usually a result of environment induced decoherence and is considered the sign
of classical behavior. We point out that the proton of a ground state hydrogen
atom can possess such a density matrix. We demonstrate on this example that an
""almost diagonal"" reduced density matrix may derive from an interaction with a
low number of degrees of freedom (in our case with a single electron) which
play the role of the environment. We also show that decoherence effects in our
example can only be observed if the interaction with the measuring device is
significantly faster than the interaction with the environment (the electron).
In the opposite case, when the interaction with the environment is significant
during the measurement process, coherence is restored.
  Finally, we propose a neutron scattering experiment on cold He atoms to
observe decoherence which shows up as an additional contribution to the
differential scattering cross section.

a coherent state resolution of unity for their construction. By choosing an
inadmissible fiducial vector, a set of ``coherent states'' spans the same space
but loses its resolution of unity, and for that reason has been called a set of
weak coherent states. Despite having no resolution of unity, it is nevertheless
shown how the propagator in such a basis may admit a phase-space path integral
representation in essentially the same form as if it had a resolution of unity.
Our examples are toy models of similar situations that arise in current studies
of quantum gravity.

We find conditions under which increasing the coupling to the bath above a

limiting behavior is a dissipationless sinusoidal oscillation that could be
interpreted as the synchronization of many modes of the uncoupled system.
