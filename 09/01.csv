direction normal to the disk (normal mode). We argue that these disk
oscillations are a result of the gravitational interaction between the central
compact object and the disk. A small displacement of the disk from the
equatorial plane results in a linear gravitational restoring force opposite to
this displacement. Our analysis shows that the frequency of this mode is a
function of the mass of the central object and it also depends on the inner and
outer radii of the disk which in turn are related to the rotation period of the
binary system. We derive an analytical formula for the frequency of the normal
disk mode and show that these frequencies can be related to the persistent
lower QPO frequencies observed in the NS and BH sources. We offer a new
independent approach to the black hole mass determination by interpreting this
low QPO frequency as the global disk oscillation frequency. The implementation
of this method combined with the independent method which uses the X-ray energy
spectra (Shrader & Titarchuk 1999) results in stringent constraints for the
black hole masses.

are well explained by extended bursts of star formation or a superposition of
several bursts. Ages and burst durations are estimated. This naturally explains
both the observed WR populations (including WN and WC stars) and the presence
of red supergiants. 2) The fitted SEDs indicate that the stellar light suffers

Salpeter IMF extending to masses >~ 40 Msun. Adopting a conservative approach
we derive a LOWER LIMIT of Mup >~ 30 Msun for the Salpeter IMF. From more
realistic assumptions on the metallicity and SF history we favour a lower limit
Mup >~ 30-40 Msun, which is also in agreement with Hbeta equivalent width

for line variability in terms of a complex physical model, we use a a simple
Gaussian to model the gross shape of the line, and then use the centroid
energy, intensity and equivalent width as robust indicators of changes in the

line intensity in NGC 4151, suggesting an origin in a region larger than the
putative accretion disk, where most of the iron line has been thought to
originate. Mkn 279 is investigated on short timescales. The time-averaged

rotation then the spin period of the neutron star in X 1658-298 is 1.8 ms. The
oscillations can be present during the rise or decay phase of the bursts.
Oscillations during the decay phase of the bursts show an increase in the
frequency of 0.5 to 1 Hz. However, in one particular burst the oscillations
reappear at the end of the decay phase at about 571.5 Hz. This represents an
increase in oscillation frequency of about 5 Hz which is the largest frequency
change seen so far in a burst oscillation. It is unclear if such a large change
can be accommodated by present models used to explain the frequency evolution
of the oscillations. The oscillations at 571.5 Hz are unusually soft compared
to the oscillations found at 567 Hz. We also observed several bursts during
which the oscillations are detected at much lower significance or not at all.
Most of these bursts happen during periods of X-ray dipping behavior,
suggesting that the X-ray dipping might decrease the amplitude of the
oscillations (although several complications exist with this simple picture).

interpretation.

uncertainty inherent to any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated,
by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution
of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well
the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the
fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable.
Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors
arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified
here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star-clusters are
systematically steeper by d_alpha=0.5 between 0.1 and 1 Msun than the
Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5 Gyr old stars.
The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter
than the Galactic-field IMF, and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf
candidates in the Galactic halo and absence of associated low-mass stars
suggests a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star-formation

the constraints on cosmological parameters. Our results show that X-ray data
are more powerful than optical ones, allowing smaller regions in the parameter
space. We find that the clustering properties of clusters are almost
independent of the matter density parameter and of the presence of a
cosmological constant, while they appear to be strongly dependent on the shape
parameter. Using the X-ray data only, we obtain Gamma~0.1 and 0.4<sigma_8<1.1

a chain of interacting clusters in the core of the Shapley Concentration. This
complex is characterized in the X-ray band by two pairs of roughly similar
interacting clumps: one pair has been resolved as two optical Abell clusters
(A3530 and A3532), while the two components of the other pair are both
associated to A3528. The optical data show that the distance between the
centers of A3530 and A3532 is smaller than their Abell radii, an indication of
the existence at least of tidal interactions, and that the contours of galaxies
in A3528 appear to be elongated in the North-South direction, pointing towards
the A3530-A3532 pair.
  From our survey we obtained ~600 new radial velocity determinations: using
this sample, we studied the dynamics of the four Abell clusters in this region
(A3528, A3530, A3532 and A3535) and derived their mean velocities and velocity
dispersions. Moreover we performed a substructure analysis, both bi-dimensional
and three-dimensional, of the whole complex.
  All the characteristics of this structure seem to point toward a merging
scenario in an early stage, whose effects on the galaxy population and on the
cluster dynamics are not yet evident, contrary to what happens in the nearby
A3558 complex, where the merging events are in a rather advanced stage and were
already able to induce modifications in the galaxy population.

a 2.1 um narrow band imaging survey covering an area of 100 sq. arcmin

these have subsequently been confirmed spectroscopically using ISAAC at the ESO
VLT. Star formation rates of the individual galaxies derived from their Halpha
fluxes are 20-35 Msolar/yr, without any correction for extinction, whereas SFRs
derived from their rest frame UV continuum fluxes are up to a factor of 4 lower
- consistent with lower extinction to Halpha. Velocity dispersions are
typically ~ 100km/s and one galaxy, observed under the most favorable
conditions, shows a rotation curve with a terminal velocity ~ 140 km/s at ~
3kpc radius which is within the range observed for nearby spiral galaxies.
These thus appear to be relatively massive systems at high redshift. Comparison
with the HST NICMOS grism Halpha survey of Yan et al. (1999) reveals little or
no evolution in the Halpha luminosity function between z ~ 1.3 and 2.2. The
inferred star formation rate density of 0.12 Msolar/Mpc^3/yr at z = 2.2 is also
equal to that at z ~ 3-4.5 derived by Steidel et al.(1999) from extinction

intermediate scales the virial motions of the galaxies cause a suppression of
the power spectrum relative to the linear one, which differs from the same
effect in dark matter. This suppression can potentially mimic the effect of
massive neutrinos and the degeneracy can only be broken if the power spectrum

converge for $k<0.1h$Mpc$^{-1}$, but give drastically different results on

also asses the level of stochasticity by calculating the cross-correlation
coefficient between the reconstructed velocity field divergence and the

problematic are galaxies predominantly found in groups and clusters, such as

obtain three average spectra of Seyferts grouped according to the hardness, and
find the equivalent width of the core (originating in a remote medium) to be
about 50 eV in all three cases. The wings are well fitted by a broad line from
a disc with strong relativistic effects. Its equivalent width correlates with
the slope, increasing from ~70 eV for the hardest spectrum to ~120 eV for the
softest one. The inner disc radius decreases correspondingly from ~40 to ~10

quadratic term prevails only in the extreme low-density (i.e., vacuum) limit

a Morita equivalent (or T-dual) description appropriate for that energy. In
this note, we study NCYM on a non-commutative torus with an irrational
deformation parameter $\theta$. In that case, an infinite tower of dual
descriptions is generically needed in order to describe the UV regime. We
construct a hierarchy of dual descriptions in terms of the continued fraction
approximations of $\theta$. We encounter different descriptions depending on
the level of the irrationality of $\theta$ and the amount of non-locality
tolerated. The behavior turns out to be isomorphic to that found for the phase
structure of the four-dimensional Villain $Z_N$ lattice gauge theories, which
we revisit as a warm-up. At large 't Hooft coupling, using the AdS/CFT
correspondance, we find that there are domains of the radial coordinate $U$
where no T-dual description makes the derivative expansion converge. The radial
direction obtains multifractal characteristics near the boundary of AdS.

diamond's boundary conditions on the behavior of typical tilings; in addition,
it yields a new proof of the arctic circle theorem of Jockusch, Propp, and
Shor. Our approach is to use the saddle point method to estimate certain
weighted sums of squares of Krawtchouk polynomials (whose relevance to domino
tilings is demonstrated elsewhere), and to combine these estimates with some
exponential sum bounds to deduce our final result. This approach generalizes
straightforwardly to the case in which the probability distribution on the set
of tilings incorporates bias favoring horizontal over vertical tiles or vice
versa. We also prove a fairly general large deviation estimate for domino
tilings of simply-connected planar regions that implies that some of our
results on Aztec diamonds apply to many other similar regions as well.

subcategory of 'simple presheaves' in !Smp, the topos of symmetric simplicial

  We show here how this homotopy theory can be extended to the topos itself,
!Smp. As a crucial advantage, the fundamental groupoid functor !Smp --> Gpd is
left adjoint to a natural functor Gpd --> !Smp, the symmetric nerve of a
groupoid, and preserves all colimits - a strong van Kampen property. Similar
results hold in all higher dimensions. Analogously, a notion of
(non-reversible) directed homotopy can be developed in the ordinary simplicial
topos Smp, with applications to image analysis as in the previous paper. We
have now a 'homotopy n-category functor' Smp --> n-Cat, left adjoint to a nerve
functor.
  This construction can be applied to various presheaf categories; the basic
requirements seem to be: finite products of representables are finitely
presentable and there is a representable 'standard interval'.

individually governed by saddle-node dynamics, with reciprocal excitatory
synaptic connections. In the deterministic circuit, the synaptic current
amplitude acts as a control parameter to move the circuit from a mono-stable
regime through a bifurcation into a bistable regime. In this regime stable
sustained anti-phase oscillations in both neurons coexist with a stable rest
state. We introduce a small amount of random current into both neurons to model
possible randomly arriving synaptic inputs. We find that such random noise
delays the onset of bistability, even though in decoupled neurons noise tends
to advance bifurcations and the circuit has only excitatory coupling. We show
that the delay is dependent on the level of noise and suggest that a curious
stochastic ``anti-resonance'' is present.
