suppressed in the weakly-ionized, quiescent disks of close binary stars.
Because accretion still proceeds during quiescence, another viscosity mechanism
operates in these systems. An anticorrelation of the recurrence times of SU UMa
dwarf novae with their mass ratio supports spiral waves or shock-waves tidally
induced by the companion star as the main process responsible for accretion in
the quiescent disks. Other weakly-ionized gaseous disks in systems lacking a
massive companion have to rely on yet another transport mechanism or they could
be essentially passive.

gamma-ray bursts GRB 990510 and GRB 990712. Through the identification of
several absorption lines in the first epoch GRB 990510 spectrum, we determine
the redshift for this burst at z >= 1.619. No clear emission lines are
detected. The strength of the MgI feature is indicative of a dense environment,
most likely the host galaxy of GRB 990510. Although the host is extremely faint
(V >~ 28), the GRB afterglow allows us to probe its interstellar medium and -
in principle - to measure its metallicity. The optical spectrum of GRB 990712
(whose host galaxy is the brightest of the known GRB hosts at cosmological
redshifts), shows clear features both in emission and absorption, at a redshift
of z = 0.4331 +/- 0.0004. On the basis of several line emission diagnostic
diagrams, we conclude that the host galaxy of GRB 990712 is most likely an HII
galaxy. We derive a unreddened [OII] star formation rate of 2.7 +/- 0.8
Msun/yr. Correcting for the measured extinction intrinsic to the host galaxy
(A(V) = \gpm{3.4}{2.4}{1.7}), this value increases to \gpm{35}{178}{25}
Msun/yr. The [OII] equivalent width, compared to that of field galaxies at z <=
1, also suggests that the host of GRB 990712 is vigorously forming stars. We
employ the oxygen and Hbeta emission-line intensities to estimate the global
oxygen abundance for the host of GRB 990712: log(O/H) = -3.7 +- 0.4, which is
slightly below the lowest metallicity one finds in nearby spiral galaxies. For
both GRBs we study the time evolution of the absorption lines, whose equivalent
width might be expected to change with time if the burst resides in a dense
compact medium. We find no evidence for a significant change in the MgII width.

obtained from Hubble Space Telescope archival WFPC2 images at late times, we
question the identification of SN 1997bs as a bona fide supernova. We believe
that it is more likely a super-outburst of a very massive luminous blue

2403 (Humphreys & Davidson 1994 [PASP, 106, 1025]). The progenitor may have
survived the outburst, since the SN is seen in early 1998 at m_F555W=23.4,
about 0.5 mag fainter than the progenitor identified by Van Dyk et al. (1999,
[AJ, 118, 2331]) in a pre-discovery image. Based on analysis of its environment
in the Hubble Space Telescope images, the progenitor was not in an H II region

t t-bar near threshold at NNLO accuracy adopting three alternative approaches,
namely (1) fixing the pole mass, (2) fixing the PS mass, and (3) fixing the new

predictions for the cross section become much more stable if we use the PS or
the PS-bar mass for the calculations. A careful analysis suggests that the top

breaking of continuously distributed vortex lines. Collapse results in
formation of the point singularities of the vorticity field $|{\bf\Omega}|$. At
the collapse point, the value of the vorticity blows up as $(t_0-t)^{-1}$ where
$t_0$ is a collapse time. The spatial structure of the collapsing distribution
approaches a pancake form: contraction occurs by the law $l_1\sim(t_0-t)^{3/2}$
along the ""soft"" direction, the characteristic scales vanish like
$l_2\sim(t_0-t)^{1/2}$ along two other (""hard"") directions. This scenario of
the collapse is shown to take place in the integrable three-dimensional
hydrodynamics with the Hamiltonian ${\cal H}=\int|{\bf\Omega}|d{\bf r}$. Most
numerical studies of collapse in the Euler equation are in a good agreement
with the proposed theory.

quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient
conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a subclass
of regular languages we get a condition which is necessary and sufficient.
  Also, we prove that the class of languages recognizable by a QFA is not
closed under union or any other binary Boolean operation where both arguments
are significant.

the population inversion at and away from resonance. At resonance, it is shown
that if the system is initially populated either in the upper or in the lower
level, then the population oscillation occurs in a way which is quite different
from that if it is initially populated in the middle state. At off resonance,
there is gradual suppression of the population in the excited states and in the
asymptotic limit of the detuning, the system returns to its initial state.
