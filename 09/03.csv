to the Sun. Based on HST WFPC2 obervations over a 3 year baseline, I report its
proper motion (332 +/- 1 mas/yr at a position angle of 100.3 +/- 0.1 degrees)
and parallax (16.5 +/- 2.3 mas; 61 pc). This proper motion brings the neutron
star from the general vicinity of the Sco-Cen OB association. For an assumed
neutron star radial velocity between -55 and -60 km/s, the runaway O star zeta
Oph, the Upper Sco OB association, and the neutron star come into spatial
coincidence between 0.9 and 1.0 million years ago. RX J185635-3754 may be the
remnant of the original primary of the zeta Oph system. If so, the space
velocity suggests that the neutron star received a kick of about 200 km/s at
birth.

$P^S(k,\mu)$ in three typical Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological models, where
$\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the wave vector and the line-of-sight.
Two distinct biased tracers derived from the primordial density peaks of
Bardeen et al. and the cluster-underweight model of Jing, Mo, & B\""orner are
considered in addition to the pure dark matter models. Based on a large set of
high resolution simulations, we have measured the redshift power spectrum for
the three tracers from the linear to the nonlinear regime. We investigate the
validity of the relation - guessed from linear theory - in the nonlinear regime
$$ P^S(k,\mu)=P^R(k)[1+\beta\mu^2]^2D(k,\mu,\sigma_{12}(k)), $$ where $P^R(k)$
is the real space power spectrum, and $\beta$ equals $\Omega_0^{0.6}/b_l$. The
damping function $D$ which should generally depend on $k$, $\mu$, and
$\sigma_{12}(k)$, is found to be a function of only one variable
$k\mu\sigma_{12}(k)$. This scaling behavior extends into the nonlinear regime,
while $D$ can be accurately expressed as a Lorentz function - well known from
linear theory - for values $D > 0.1$. The difference between $\sigma_{12}(k)$
and the pairwise velocity dispersion defined by the 3-D peculiar velocity of
the simulations (taking $r=1/k$) is about 15%. Therefore $\sigma_{12}(k)$ is a
good indicator of the pairwise velocity dispersion. The exact functional form
of $D$ depends on the cosmological model and on the bias scheme. We have given
an accurate fitting formula for the functional form of $D$ for the models
studied.

vortices do not interact and therefore all vortex states have the same energy.
Developing a secular perturbation theory we studied how this degeneracy is
lifted when kappa is slightly different from 1\sqrt{2} or when the GL theory is
extended to the higher in T-Tc terms. We constructed a simple secular
functional, that depends only on few experimentally measurable phenomenological
parameters and therefore is quite efficient to study the vortex state of
superconductor in this transitional region of kappa. Basing on this, we
calculated such vortex state properties as: critical fields, energy of the
normal-superconductor interface, energy of the vortex lattice, vortex
interaction energy etc. and compared them with previous results that were based

structures is limited. In this paper we find one way to characterize the
compact structures of lattice protein model. A quantity called Partnum is given
to each compact structure. The Partnum is compared with the concept
Designability of protein structures emerged recently. It is shown that the
highly designable structures have, on average, an atypical number of local
degree of freedom. The statistical property of Partnum and its dependence on
sequence length is also studied.

generation and hysteresis behavior, are predicted.
