reionization history of the universe, which allows us to describe the
generation of the secondary CMB anisotropies due to the kinetic SZ effect. We
take into account the ""patchy pattern"" of reionization (HII bubbles), the
cross-correlations of these ionized regions, the small-scale fluctuations of
the matter density field and the contribution from collapsed objects. For an
open universe, we find that the power-spectrum $l(l+1)C_l/(2\pi)$ exhibits a
plateau of height $10^{-13}$ in the range $10^3 < l < 10^6$. We find that for
large wavenumbers $l > 10^4$ the signal is dominated by the contribution from
collapsed halos while for $l < 10^4$ it is governed by the large-scale
correlations of HII bubbles. This implies that one cannot discriminate
reionization by stars from a quasar-driven scenario since the size of ionized
regions never dominates the behaviour of the anisotropies. Moreover, the
secondary CMB anisotropies arise from a broad range of redshifts (7.5<z<10 for
the IGM and 0<z<7 for galactic halos). The signal expected in our model might
bias the cosmological parameter estimation from CMB experiments such as Planck
and could be detected by future mm-wavelength interferometers (e.g., ALMA).

and second, these clusters are supposed to follow scaling relations with mass:
Temperature-Mass (T-M) and X-ray Luminosity-Mass (L_x - M). As a difference
with many other authors we do not assume specific scaling relations to model
cluster properties such as the usual $T-M$ virial relation or one observational
determination of the $L_x-T$ relation. Instead we consider general free
parameter scaling relations. With the previous model (PS plus scalings) we fit
our free parameters to several X-ray and optical data with the advantage over
many other works that we consider all the data sets at the same time. This
prevents us from being inconsistent with some of the available observations.
Among other interesting conclusions, we find that only low-density universes
are compatible with all the data considered and that the degeneracy between
$\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ is broken. Also we obtain interesting limits on the
parameters characterizing the scaling relations.

observed absence of strong streaming motions in the survey data. The nature of

find all the critical points of the system for constant equations of state in
that range. We consider further several background quantities that can
distinguish the models with different $w_X$ values. Using a simple toy model
with a varying equation of state, we show that even a large variation of $w_X$
at small redshifts is very difficult to observe with $d_L(z)$ measurements up
to $z\sim 1$. Therefore, it will require accurate measurements in the range
$1<z<2$ and independent accurate knowledge of $\Omega_{m,0}$ (and/or
$\Omega_{X,0}$) in order to resolve a variable $w_X$ from a constant $w_X$.

to be numerically very large. We argue that large higher twist effects do not

half-space from acoustic measurements made in the accessible half-space. If the
measurements are of limited precision, some scatterers will be undetectable
because their scattered fields are below the precision of the measuring
instrument. How can we make measurements that are optimal for detecting the
presence of an object? In other words, what incident fields should we apply
that will result in the biggest measurements?
  There are many ways to formulate this question, depending on the measuring
instruments. In this paper we consider a formulation involving wave-splitting
in the accessible half-space: what downgoing wave will result in an upgoing
wave of greatest energy?
  A closely related question arises in the case when we have a guess about the
configuration of the inaccessible half-space. What measurements should we make
to determine whether our guess is accurate? In this case we compare the
scattered field to the field computed from the guessed configuration. Again we
look for the incident field that results in the greatest energy difference.
  We show that the optimal incident field can be found by an iterative process
involving time reversal ``mirrors''. For band-limited incident fields and
compactly supported scatterers, in the generic case this iterative process
converges to a single time-harmonic field. In particular, the process
automatically ""tunes"" to the best frequency. This analysis provides a
theoretical foundation for the frequency-shifting and pulse-broadening observed
in certain computations and time-reversal experiments.

cell society, a novel theory for stem cell differentiation and its regulation
is proposed as the ``chaos hypothesis''. Two fundamental features of stem cell
systems - stochastic differentiation of stem cells and the robustness of a
system due to regulation of this differentiation - are found to be general
properties of a system of interacting cells exhibiting chaotic intra-cellular
reaction dynamics and cell division, whose presence does not depend on the
detail of the model. It is found that stem cells differentiate into other cell
types stochastically due to a dynamical instability caused by cell-cell
interactions, in a manner described by the Isologous Diversification theory.
This developmental process is shown to be stable not only with respect to
molecular fluctuations but also with respect to removal of cells. With this
developmental process, the irreversible loss of multipotency accompanying the
change from a stem cell to a differentiated cell is shown to be characterized
by a decrease in the chemical diversity in the cell and of the complexity of
the cellular dynamics. The relationship between the division speed and this
loss of multipotency is also discussed. Using our model, some predictions that
can be tested experimentally are made for a stem cell system.

deformations, which results in asymmetric fragment mass distributions. Recently
we have shown [3,4] that the onset of this asymmetry can be explained in the
semiclassical periodic orbit theory by a few short periodic orbits lying in
planes perpendicular to the symmetry axis. Presently we show that these orbits
are surrounded by small islands of stability in an otherwise chaotic phase
space, and that the wavefunctions of the diabatic quantum states that are most
sensitive to the left-right asymmetry have their extrema in the same planes. An
EBK quantization of the classical motion near these planes reproduces the exact
eigenenergies of the diabatic quantum states surprisingly well.

growth rates. The surface modes have a larger spinodal region, reaching out to
densities and temperatures way beyond the spinodal line for bulk instabilities.
Essential experimental features of multifragmentation, like fragmentation
temperatures and fragment-mass distributions (in particular the power-law
behavior) are consistent with the instability properties of an expanding
nuclear droplet, and hence with a dynamical fragmentation process within the
spinodal regime of bulk and surface modes (spinodal decomposition).

  Energy Forum 2000, Munich, Germany, September 11-15, 2000",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  We recall that hydrogen combustion does resolve the environmental problems of
fossil fuels due to excessive emission of carcinogenic substances and carbon
dioxide. However, hydrogen combustion implies the permanent removal from our
atmosphere of directly usable oxygen, a serious environmental problem called
oxygen depletion, since the combustion turns oxygen into water whose separation
to restore the original oxygen is prohibitive due to cost. We then show that a
conceivable global use of hydrogen in complete replacement of fossil fuels
would imply the permanent removal from our atmosphere of 2.8875x10^7 metric
tons O_2/day. Fuel cells are briefly discussed to point out similarly serious
environmental problems, again, for large uses. We propose the possibility of
resolving these problems by upgrading hydrogen to the new combustible fuel
called magnegas^TM, whose chemical structure is composed by the new chemical
species of magnecules, whose energy content and other features are beyond the
descriptive capacities of quantum chemistry. In fact, magnegas contains up to
50% hydrogen, while having combustion exhaust with: 1) a positive oxygen
balance (releasing more oxygen in the exhaust than that used in the
combustion); 2) no appreciable carcinogenic or toxic substances; 3)
considerably reduced carbon dioxide as compared to fossil fuels; 4)
considerably reduced nitrogen oxides; and 5) general reduction of pollutants in
the exhaust up to 96% of current EPA standards.

either by using the potential formalism either by the statistical method.
Therefore, Pontrjagin's extremum principle of control theory is applied to an
extended ensemble average. This approach allows to derive the grand partition
function of thermodynamics as a result of a control problem with the Hamilton
energy. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle follows and the second law
in a modified form. The derivation can predict second law violations if cycles
with irreversibilities in varying potential fields are included into
consideration. This conclusion is supported indirectly by experimental data
from literature. The upper maximum gain efficiency of a cycle with a known
polymer solution as dielectrics was estimated to less than 1 promille per
cycle. Note added in proof 28th October 2003: Comparing this preprint work with
an analogous ferrofluidic system discrepancies are is found which show that the
concrete model proposed here in section 4 is insufficient to settle the
question. A way to solve the problem is proposed.

sufficient to derive Bell inequalities when measurements of photon number are
only accurate to an uncertainty of order $n$ photons, where $n$ is macroscopic.
Macroscopic local realism is only sufficient to imply, in the context of the
original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument, fuzzy ``elements of reality'' which
have a macroscopic indeterminacy. We show therefore how the violation of local
realism in the presence of macroscopic uncertainties implies the failure of
``macroscopic local realism''. Quantum states violating this macroscopic local
realism are presented.
