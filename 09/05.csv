the Rapid Burster (RB), made during the 1998 February-March outburst. In the
first observation, approximately 20 days after the outburst peak, the X-ray
light curve showed Type II bursts at a rate of 43 per hour. Nine days later,
during the second BeppoSAX pointing, only 5 Type II bursts were detected at the
beginning of the observation. During the third pointing no X-ray bursts were
detected and in the fourth and final observation the RB was not detected at
all. Persistent emission from the RB was detected up to 10 keV during the first
three pointings. The spectra of the persistent and bursting emissions below 10
keV were best fit with a model consisting of two blackbodies. An additional
component (a power law) was needed to describe the 1-100 keV bursting spectrum
when the persistent emission was subtracted. To our knowledge, this is the
first detection of the RB beyond 20 keV. We discuss the evolution of the
spectral parameters for the bursting and persistent emission during the
outburst decay. The light curve, after the second BeppoSAX pointing, showed a
steepening of the previous decay trend, and a sharper decay rate leading to
quiescence was observed with BeppoSAX in the two subsequent observations. We
interpret this behaviour as caused by the onset of the propeller effect.
Finally, we infer a neutron star magnetic field B ~ 4 10^8 Gauss.

galaxies due to the gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster CL0024+1654
(z=0.39). The radial depletion curves show a significant depletion in both
bands within a radius of 40''-70'' from the cluster center. This is the first
time depletion is detected in the U band. This gives independent evidence for a
break in the slope of the U band luminosity function at faint magnitudes. The
radially averaged R band depletion curve is broader and deeper than in the U
band. The differences can be attributed to the wavelength dependence of the
slope of the luminosity function and to the different redshift distribution of
the objects probed in the two bands. We estimate the Einstein radius of a
singular isothermal sphere lens model using maximum likelihood analysis.
Adopting a slope of the number counts of 0.2 and using the background density
found beyond 150'' from the cluster center we find an Einstein radius of
17''+/-3'' and 25''+/-3'' in the U and R band, respectively. When combined with
the redshift of the single background galaxy at z=1.675 seen as four giant arcs
around 30'' from the cluster center, these values indicate a median redshift in
the range 0.7 to 1.1 for the U_AB > 24 mag and R_AB > 24 mag populations.

potentially useful Ne I lines are found in the red region of the spectra of
these stars. The mean neon abundance in the normal stars (log A =8.10) is in
excellent agreement with the standard abundance of neon (8.08). However, in
HgMn stars, neon is almost universally underabundant, ranging from marginal
deficits of 0.1-0.3 dex to underabundances of an order of magnitude or more. In
many cases, the lines are so weak that only upper limits can be established.
The most extreme example found is upsilon Her with an underabundance of at
least 1.5 dex. These underabundances are qualitatively expected from radiative
acceleration calculations, which show that Ne has a very small radiative
acceleration in the photosphere and is expected to undergo gravitational
settling if mixing processes are sufficiently weak, and there is no strong
stellar wind. According to the theoretical predictions of Landstreet et al.

such stellar winds, which must be less than $10^-14 M_sun per yr if they are

tidal torques exerted on neighboring proto-galaxies by the smoothly varying
shear field. We compute the predicted amplitude of such ellipticity
correlations using the Zel'dovich approximation for a realistic distribution of
galaxy shapes. Weak gravitational lensing can also induce ellipticity
correlations since the images of neighboring galaxies will be distorted
coherently. On comparing these two effects that induce shape correlations, we
find that for current weak lensing surveys with a median redshift of z_m = 1,
the intrinsic signal is of order 1 - 10 percent of the measured signal.
However, for shallower surveys with z_m < 0.3, the intrinsic correlations
dominate over the lensing signal. The distortions induced by lensing are
curl-free, whereas those resulting from intrinsic alignments are not. This
difference can be used to disentangle these two sources of ellipticity

subject to local dust extinction.
  Photoionization models for both PNe are obtained from two different codes,
allowing theoretical uncertainties to be assessed. Wray 16-423, excited by a
star of Teff 1.07x10^5K, is an ellipsoidal, matter-bounded nebula, except for a
denser sector. He 2-436, excited by a 7x10^4K star, includes two
radiation-bounded shells, with the inner one possibly corresponding to a
transitory event. Both stars are on the same (H-burning) evolutionary track of
initial mass (1.2+/-0.1) Msun and may be twins, with the PN ejection of Wray
16-423 having occured ~1500 years before He 2-436.
  The PN abundances re-inforce the common origin of the parent stars,
indicating almost identical depletions with respect to solar for O, Ne, Mg, S,

strong overabundances for carbon, particularly in He2-436. Excess nitrogen
makes Wray 16-423 nearly a Type I PN. These PNe provide a means to calibrate
both metallicity and age of the Sagittarius stellar population, and they
confirm that the youngest, most metal-rich population has an age of 5Gyr and a
metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.55, in agreement with the slope of the red giant

factor, $s$, for an inflation with thermal dissipation is at least 0.5. This
prediction does not depend on the details of the model parameters. If $s$ is
larger than 0.5, it implies that the friction parameter $\Gamma$ is larger than

overview of the current state of art of observations of cosmic magnetic fields.
We then illustrate the arguments in favour of a primordial origin of magnetic
fields in the galaxies and in the clusters of galaxies. We argue that the most
promising way to test this hypothesis is to look for possible imprints of
magnetic fields on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMBR). With this purpose in mind, we provide a
review of the most relevant effects of magnetic fields on the CMBR. A long
chapter of this review is dedicated to particle physics inspired models which
predict the generation of magnetic fields during the early Universe evolution.
Although it is still unclear if any of these models can really explain the
origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields, we show that interesting
effects may arise anyhow. Among these effects, we discuss the consequences of
strong magnetic fields on the big-bang nucleosynthesis, on the masses and
couplings of the matter constituents, on the electroweak phase transition, and
on the baryon and lepton number violating sphaleron processes. Several
intriguing common aspects, and possible interplay, of magnetogenesis and
baryogenesis are also dicussed.

from the COP survey are based upon the recent observational work of Adami et
al. (2000) and Holden et al. (2000) and use new spectroscopic and photometric
data on six clusters selected from the Palomar Distant Cluster Survey (PDCS;
Postman et al. 1996). We have compared the COP and CNOC samples to the ESO
Nearby Abell Cluster Survey (ENACS: z~0.07). Our sample shows that the z<0.4
clusters have the same velocity dispersion versus magnitude, morphological type
and radius relationships as nearby Abell clusters. The z~0.48 clusters exhibit,
however, departures from these relations. Furthermore, there appears to be a
higher fraction of late-type (or bluer, e.g. Butcher and Oemler, 1984) galaxies
in the distant clusters compared to the nearby ones. The classical scenario in
which massive galaxies virialize before they evolve from late into early type
explain our observations. In such a scenario, the clusters of our sample began
to form before a redshift of ~0.8 and the late-type galaxy population had a
continuous infall into the clusters.

excited LL, $V({\cal R})$ is harmonic at short range and a different series of

Moore-Read $\nu={5\over2}$ state and in the $\nu={7\over3}$ and ${8\over3}$

parentage from ${\cal R}=5$. The $\nu={7\over3}$ and ${8\over3}$ states are
different from Laughlin $\nu={1\over3}$ and ${2\over3}$ states and, in finite

correlated states of electron pairs at $\nu=2+2/(q_2+2)={8\over3}$,

expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in
front of it, motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside
the disturbed region is possible. The resulting distortion is reminiscent of
the ``warp drive'' of science fiction. However, just as it happens with

possibly describe traveling-wave convection in a channel with an inner vertical
partition. By means of systematic simulations, we find new types of stable
localized excitations, which exist in the system in addition to the earlier
found stationary pulses. The new localized excitations include pulses existing
on top of a small-amplitude background (that may be regular or chaotic) {\em
above} the threshold of instability of the zero solution, and breathers into
which stationary pulses are transformed through a Hopf bifurcation below the
zero-solution instability threshold. A sharp border between the stable
stationary pulses and breathers, precluding their coexistence, is identified.
Stable bound states of two breathers with a phase shift $\pi /2$ between their
internal vibrations are found too. Above the threshold, the pulses are standing
if the small-amplitude background oscillations are regular; if the background
is chaotic, the pulses are randomly walking. With the increase of the system's
size, more randomly walking pulses are spontaneously generated. The random walk
of different pulses in a multi-pulse state is synchronized (but not completely)
due to their mutual repulsion. At a large overcriticality, the multi-pulse

  three-body forces","16 pages, 5 figures, revtex, epsfig, amsmath",,,,"nucl-th",,"  The use of leading order effective field theory (EFT) to describe
neutron-deuteron scattering leads to integral equations that have unusual
behaviour: when only two-body interactions are included, the scattering
amplitude does not approach a limit when the cutoff used to solve the equations
is removed. It has recently been shown that this cutoff dependence can be
eliminated by the careful inclusion of a three-body force. In this paper we
show that the cutoff dependence is just a reflection of the fact that the
aforementioned integral equations admit an infinite number of solutions amongst
which only one corresponds to the physical scattering amplitude. We show how to
numerically extract the physical scattering amplitude from the general solution
and in this way explicitly demonstrate that the amplitude for a particle
scattering off a two-body bound state, in leading order EFT, is in fact
determined entirely by two-body forces.

properties of QCD only. An increase of the quarkonium hadronisation time with
the initial energy leads to a gradual change of the most important phenomena
from fixed target- to collider-energies. We evaluate nuclear effects in the
quarkonium production due to medium modification of the momentum distribution
of the heavy quarks produced in the hard interactions, i.e. due to the
broadening of the transverse momentum distribution. Other nuclear effects, i.e.
nuclear shadowing and parton energy loss, are also evaluated.

effect of the quark interchange and the spin-flavour structure of the effective
quark-quark interaction. Such a symmetry structure stems from the pseudoscalar
meson exchange between the quarks and is a consequence of the spontaneous
breaking of the chiral symmetry. We perform single and coupled channel
calculations and show the role of coupling of the $\Delta\Delta$ and hidden
color CC channels on the behaviour of the phase shifts.

gradient-diffusion experiments to simulate several decoherence models of
interest in quantum information processing, along with their Lindblad and Kraus
representations. Gradient-diffusion experiments are also described for several
more complex forms of decoherence, including the well-known collective
isotropic model. Finally, it is shown that the Hadamard formalism gives a
concise representation of decoherence with arbitrary correlations among the
fluctuating fields at the different spins involved, and that this can be
applied to both decoherence (T2) as well as nonadiabatic relaxation (T1)
processes.

in entropy. Does this necessarily convert this quantum system into a classical
system? The answer to this question is No. The decrease of coherence means more
uncertainty. This does not seem to make the system closer to classical system
where there are no uncertainties. We examine the problem using two coupled
harmonic oscillators where we make observations on one of them while the other
oscillator is assumed to be unobservable or to be in Feynman's rest of the
universe. Our ignorance about the rest of the universe causes an increase in
entropy. However, does the system act like a classical system? The answer is
again No. When and how does this system appear like a classical system? It is
shown that this paradox can be resolved only if measurements are taken along
the normal coordinates. It is also shown that Feynman's parton picture is one
concrete physical example of this decoherence mechanism.
