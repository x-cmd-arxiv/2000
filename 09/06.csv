during a one-year-long observational campaign are presented, and supplemented
by late time HST photometry. Spectroscopically, SN 1996X appears to be a
`normal' SN Ia. The apparent magnitude at maximum was B=13.24 +/- 0.02, and the
colour B-V=0.00 +/- 0.03. The luminosity decline rate, Delta m_B(15) = 1.31 +/-
0.08, is close to average for a SN Ia. The best estimate of the galactic
extinction is A_B=0.30 +/- 0.05, and there is evidence that reddening within
the parent galaxy is negligible. Detailed comparison of the light and colour
curves of various `normal' SNe Ia shows that the assumption that multicolour
light curves can be described simply as a one-parameter family is not perfect.
Together with problems in the calibration of the templates, this may explain
the discrepancies in the distance modulus derived adopting different
calibrations of the absolute magnitude vs. light curve shape relations. Indeed
we found that M_B ranges from -19.08 to -19.48 and M-m range from 32.02 to
32.48 depending on the method used (Hamuy et al. 1996a,Phillips et al. 1999,
Riess et al. 1998a). Computations of model light curve and synthetic spectra
for both early- and late-times, confirm that 1996X is a normal Type Ia SN and
that a satisfactory fit can be obtained using a W7 progenitor structure only if
we adopt the short distance. A larger distance would imply a too large Ni mass
for this fainter than average SNIa.

significance of starburst-driven galactic superwinds. These flows are driven
primarily by the kinetic energy supplied by supernovae. Superwinds are complex,
multiphase phenomena requiring a panchromatic observational approach. They are
ubiquitous in galaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area
exceeds roughly 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (a condition
satisfied by local starbursts and high-z Lyman Break galaxies). Data on X-ray
emission, optical line-emission, and optical/UV interstellar absorption-lines
together imply that the mass outflow rates are comparable to the
star-formation-rates and that the conversion of kinetic energy from supernovae
to superwind is quite efficient ($\sim$ 30 to 100%). Measured/inferred outflow
speeds range from a few $\times 10^2$ to 10$^3$ km/s and appear to be
independent of the rotation speed of the ``host'' galaxy. The outflows are
dusty (dust/gas ratios of $\sim$ 1% by mass). These properties imply that
superwinds may have established the mass-metallicity relation in elliptical and
bulges, polluted the inter-galactic medium to a metallicity of $\sim$ 10 to 30%
solar, heated the inter-galactic medium by up to $\sim$1 kev per baryon, and
ejected enough dust into the inter-galactic medium to have potentially

The central source is extended by ~1"" in the north-south direction but appears

of its flux can be ascribed to a core structure which is itself elongated
north-south and does not show a distinct unresolved compact source. The source
is strongly asymmetric, extending significantly further to the north than to
the south. The morphology of the mid-infrared emission appears similar to that
of the radio jet, and has features which correlate with the images in [O III].
Its 12.5-24.5 micron color temperature ranges from 215 to 260 K and does not
decrease smoothly with distance from the core. Silicate absorption is strongest
in the core and to the south and is small in the north.

Combining these profiles with accurate low-ion (e.g., Fe II) profiles, we
investigate the kinematic state of DLAs in the redshift range 1.8 < z < 4.4 by
comparisons between data for various ion pairs.
  We find the DLAs comprise distinct kinematic subsystems: a low ion subsystem
in which the low ions are physically associated with intermediate ions, and a
high subsystem containing neither low nor intermediate ions. The evidence for
two subsystems stems from (a) differences between the widths of the velocity
profiles, (b) misalignment in velocity space between the narrow components
comprising the profiles in each subsystem, and (c) significant dissimilarities
between the mean velocities of the high ion and low ion velocity profiles. In
every case we find that test statistics such as velocity width and various
asymmetry parameters distribute differently for low ions than for high ions.
  Despite misalignment in velocity space, the low and high ion kinematic
subsystems are interrelated. This is indicated by detection of a statistically
significant C IV versus low-ion cross correlation function, and by a systematic
effect where the C IV velocity widths are greater than or equal to the low ion
velocity widths in 29 out of 32 systems. These phenomena are consistent with
the location of the two subsystems in the same potential well.

weighted mass distributions predicted by CDM cosmogonies, or by the null
hypothesis (TF model) that the dark matter mass distribution has not evolved
since z ~ 3. In our models, C IV absorption lines detected in DLAs arise in
infalling ionized clouds while the low-ion absorption lines arise from neutral
gas in the disks. Using Monte Carlo methods we find: (a) The CDM models are
incompatible with the low-ion statistics at more than 99% confidence whereas
some TF models cannot be excluded at more than 88% confidence. (b) Both CDM and
TF models agree with the observed distribution of C IV velocity widths. (c) The
CDM models generate differences between the mean velocities of C IV and low ion

the means that are too large. (d) Both CDM and TF models produce ratios of C IV
to low-ion velocity widths that are too large. (e) Both CDM and TF models
generate C IV versus low-ion cross-correlation functions incompatible with the

  While it is possible to select model parameters resulting in consistency with
the data, the disk-halo configuration assumed in both cosmogonies still does
not produce significant overlap in velocity space between C IV low-ion velocity
profiles. We conjecture that including angular momentum of the infalling clouds
will increase the overlap between C IV and low-ion profiles.

extinction along the line of sight to the BLR (E(B-V)~0.5 for SMC-type screen
extinction at the QSO redshift). The implied gas column density along the line
of sight is much less than is implied by the weak X-ray flux of the object,
suggesting that either the BLR and BAL region have a low dust-to-gas ratio, or
that the rest-frame optical light encounters significantly lower mean column
density lines of sight than the X-ray emission. From the rest-frame UV-optical
spectrum, we are able to constrain the stellar mass content of the system.
Comparing the maximal stellar mass with the black hole mass estimated from the
bolometric luminosity of the QSO, we find that the ratio of the black hole to
stellar mass may be comparable to the Magorrian value, which would imply that
the Magorrian relation is already in place at z=1.5. However, multiple factors
favor a much larger black hole to stellar mass ratio. This would imply that if
the Magorrian relation characterizes the late history of QSOs, and the
situation observed for F1556+3517 is typical of the early evolutionary history
of QSOs, central black hole masses develop more rapidly than bulge masses.

the development of thermal instability in the hot gas. In order to see the
maximum influence of the instability on the global structure of the galactic
outflows, we study inhomogeneous comoving flows and the non-linear fate of the
fluctuations in the flows. We compare the results with solutions for
homogeneous flows. In the case of supersonic flows, the global structure of
inhomogeneous flows is not much different from that of homogeneous flows.
However, detailed investigation shows that the average density of inhomogeneous
flows decreases faster than that of homogeneous flows, because local thermal
instability removes overdense regions in the inhomogeneous flows and reduces
the mass flux. We also find that when the gravity of a galaxy is strong, the
cold clouds formed from the removed gas are distributed in the galactic halo.
In the case of subsonic flows, the form of inhomogeneous flows is different
from that of homogeneous flows near the regions where the flows terminate. The
density rise appearing near the regions where the homogeneous flows terminate
is not seen in the inhomogeneous flows because the local thermal instability
decreases the mass flux. The cold clouds formed through thermal instability in
the inhomogeneous flow almost all coast to the same maximum radius.

follows: (i) Tearing-mode instability is excited by the supernova shock, and
the current sheet becomes thin in its nonlinear stage. (ii) The current-sheet
thinning is saturated when the current-sheet thickness becomes comparable to
that of Sweet-Parker current sheet. After that, Sweet-Parker type reconnection
starts, and the current-sheet length increases. (iii) ``Secondary tearing-mode

further current-sheet thinning occurs and anomalous resistivity sets in,
because gas density decreases in the current sheet. Petschek type reconnection
starts and heats interstellar gas. Magnetic energy is released quickly while

the variation of the HB morphologies between GCs having similar metallicities

furthermore, the value of $n$ that can be measured is always smaller than the

reasons for these are tracked down to the anomalously low atomic p orbital

in this superfield is the sterile neutrino, which combines with one linear
combination of $\nu_e-\nu_{\mu}-\nu_{\tau}$ to form a Dirac pair whose mass
accounts for the LSND anomaly. Its small mass can be ascribed to a volume
suppression factor associated with extra compact dimensions. On the other hand
the sterile neutrino scalar partner can trigger the spontaneous violation of
R-parity, thereby inducing the necessary mass splittings to fit also the solar
and atmospheric neutrino data. Thus the model can explain all neutrino
oscillation data. It leads to four predictions for the neutrino oscillation
parameters and implies that the atmospheric neutrino problem must include at
least some $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_s$ oscillations, which will be testable in the
near future. Moreover it also predicts that the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) decays visibly via lepton number violating modes, which could be
searched for at present and future accelerators.

transmitted from a dipole antenna to a parallel near-field dipole detecting
antenna. The phase difference between the two antenna signals is monitored with
an oscilloscope as the distance between the antennas is increased. Analysis of
the phase vs distance curve indicates that superluminal transverse electric
field waves (phase and group) are generated approximately one-quarter
wavelength outside the source and propagate toward and away from the source.
Upon creation, the transverse waves travel with infinite speed. The outgoing
transverse waves reduce to the speed of light after they propagate about one
wavelength away from the source. The inward propagating transverse fields
rapidly reduce to the speed of light and then rapidly increase to infinite
speed as they travel into the source. The results are shown to be consistent
