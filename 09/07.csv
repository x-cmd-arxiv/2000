absence of detectable odd images allows us to place a lower limit on the
power-law slope of the inner mass profile of lensing galaxies. Using a sample
of six two-image radio-loud lens systems and assuming a singular power-law
surface density (Sigma proportional to r^{-beta}) for the inner several kpc of
the mass distribution, we find that there is less than a 10% probability that
the data are consistent with profile slopes beta < 0.80. Furthermore,
individual mass modeling yields beta > 0.85 for B0739+366 and beta > 0.91 for
B1030+074. Modeling central black holes as additional point masses changes the
constraints in these systems to beta > 0.84 and beta > 0.83, respectively. The
inner mass profiles of lensing galaxies are therefore not much shallower than
isothermal.

at the compilation of a statistically complete sample of very X-ray luminous
(and thus, by inference, massive), distant clusters of galaxies. The primary
goal of the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS) is to increase the number of known
massive clusters at z>0.3 from a handful to hundreds. Upon completion of the
survey, the MACS cluster sample will greatly improve our ability to study
quantitatively the physical and cosmological parameters driving cluster
evolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.
  To achieve these goals we apply an X-ray flux and X-ray hardness-ratio cut to
select distant cluster candidates from the ROSAT Bright Source Catalogue.
Starting from a list of more than 5,000 X-ray sources within the survey area of
22,735 square degrees we use positional cross-correlations with public
catalogues of Galactic and extragalactic objects, reference to APM colours,
visual inspection of Digitized Sky Survey images, extensive CCD imaging, and
finally spectroscopic observations with the University of Hawaii's 2.2m and the
Keck 10m telescopes to compile the final cluster sample.
  We discuss in detail the X-ray selection procedure and the resulting
selection function, and present model predictions for the number of distant
clusters expected to emerge from MACS. At the time of this writing the MACS
cluster sample comprises 101 spectroscopically confirmed clusters at 0.3<z<0.6;
more than two thirds of these are new discoveries. Our preliminary sample is
already 15 times larger than that of the EMSS in the same redshift and X-ray
luminosity range.

reject a generally assumed hypothesis of a constant ratio between Dark Matter
Halo and the Black Hole mass, since the observed data could not be fitted under
this assumption. We found that the relation between the Dark Matter Halos and
Black Hole masses is better described by M_{BH}=M_{DMH}^{0.668}. This model
provides a reasonable fit to the observed quasar luminosity function at
redshifts higher than ~2.0. We suggest that the disagreement at lower redshift
is due to mergers. Based on the agreement at high redshift, we estimated the

If taken into account, the element abundance ratios in DLAs are quite
consistent with those observed in Milky Way stars and in metal-poor H II

  We find that an Einstein - de Sitter universe with simple passive evolution
gives an excellent fit to the counts and redshift data at all magnitudes. An
open, low Omega_{0}, model with no net evolution (and conservation of the
number of ellipticals), which fits the counts equally well, is somewhat less
successful, predicting slightly lower mean redshifts and, more significantly,
the lack of a high--z tail. A number conserving model with a dominant
contribution from Lambda_{0}, on the other hand, is far less successful,
predicting a much narrower distribution than seen. More complex models are
obviously possible, but we conclude that if large scale transmutation between

poor fit to the current data.

percentage seems to increase toward shorter wavelengths, however the polarized
spectrum does not vary significantly with time. The most remarkable variability
event occurred on 1998 June 18, when the degree of linear polarization
decreased by more than a factor 2 in one day in all bands, while the PA rotated

effective pair potential between their centers of mass. This mapping is
achieved by inverting the pair distribution function of the centers of mass of
the original polymer chains, using integral equation techniques from the theory
of simple fluids. The resulting effective pair potential is finite at all
distances, has a range of the order of the radius of gyration, and turns out to
be only moderately concentration-dependent. The dependence of the effective
potential on polymer length is analyzed in an effort to extract the scaling
limit. The effective potential is used to derive the osmotic equation of state,
which is compared to simulation data for the full SAW segment model, and to the
predictions of renormalization group calculations. A similar inversion
procedure is used to derive an effective wall-polymer potential from the center
of mass density profiles near the wall, obtained from simulations of the full
polymer segment model. The resulting wall-polymer potential turns out to depend
strongly on bulk polymer concentration when polymer-polymer correlations are
taken into account, leading to a considerable enhancement of the effective
repulsion with increasing concentration. The effective polymer-polymer and
wall-polymer potentials are combined to calculate the depletion interaction
induced by SAW polymers between two walls. The calculated depletion interaction
agrees well with the ``exact'' results from much more computer-intensive direct
simulation of the full polymer-segment model, and clearly illustrates the
inadequacy -- in the semi-dilute regime -- of the standard Asakura-Oosawa
approximation based on the assumption of non-interacting polymer coils.

liquid crystals. In general, chirality favors a twist in the orientation of
liquid-crystal molecules. In some cases, as in the cholesteric phase, this
favored twist can be achieved without any defects. More often, the favored
twist competes with applied electric or magnetic fields or with geometric
constraints, leading to frustration. In response to this frustration, the
system develops ordered structures with periodic arrays of defects. The
simplest example of such a structure is the lattice of domains and domain walls
in a cholesteric phase under a magnetic field. More complex examples include
defect structures formed in two-dimensional films of chiral liquid crystals.
The same considerations of chirality and defects apply to three-dimensional
structures, such as the twist-grain-boundary and moire phases.

now includes 23 silicon microstrip planes for vertex reconstruction. A new data
acquisition system read out 9000 events/sec during the part of the Tevatron
cycle that delivered beam. Digitization and readout took 50 uS per event. Data
was buffered in eight large FIFO memories to allow continuous event building
and continuous tape writing to a wall of 42 Exabytes at 9.6 MB/sec. The 50
terabytes of data buffered to tape is now being filtered on RISC CPUs.
Preliminary results show D0 --> K- pi+ and D+ --> K- pi+ pi+ decays. Rarer
decays will be pursued.

work in the broken symmetry phase of QCD in which chiral symmetry breaking
operators must appear directly in the hamiltonian because the vacuum is
trivial. Assuming any candidate interactions are local in the transverse
direction, I argue that they are probably relevant operators so that
perturbation theory is not modified at high energies. Since light-front chiral
symmetry corresponds to quark helicity conservation, we can readily identify
candidate chiral symmetry breaking interactions. The only candidate relevant
operator is the quark-gluon emission/absorption operator with a quark spin

This fact might have important implications on the determination of WIMP relic
densities. On the other hand, the definition of number densities in a
interacting theory is not a straightforward procedure. It usually requires
renormalization of composite operators and operator mixing, which obscure the
physical interpretation of the computed thermal average. We propose a new
definition for the thermal average of a composite operator, which does not
require any new renormalization counterterm and is thus free from such
ambiguities. Applying this definition to the model of Matsumoto and Yoshimura
we find that it gives number densities which are Boltzmann-suppressed at any
order in perturbation theory. We discuss also heavy particles which are
unstable already at T=0, showing that power law corrections do in general
emerge in this case.

with G not cong G+R, which provide (even essentially indecomposable) counter
examples to the question mentioned above. Is CH a necessary condition to find
`nasty' reflexive modules? In the last part of this paper we will show
(assuming the existence of supercompact cardinals) that large reflexive modules
always have large summands. So at least being essentially indecomposable needs
an additional set theoretic assumption. However the assumption need not be CH
as shown in the first part of this paper. We will use Martin's axiom to find
reflexive modules with the above decomposition which are submodules of the

exponents of two and three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time Lyapunov exponents describe the
average rate of separation, along characteristic directions, of neighboring
trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate transformation that
takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates) to the state of the
system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates). This coordinate
transformation naturally defines a metric tensor, from which the Lyapunov
exponents and characteristic directions are obtained. By requiring that the
Riemann curvature tensor vanish for the metric tensor (a basic result of
differential geometry in a flat space), differential constraints relating the
finite-time Lyapunov exponents to the characteristic directions are derived.
These constraints are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence
of the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally small
in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large, which has
implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the advection-diffusion
equation. The constraints also modify previous estimates of the asymptotic
growth rates of quantities in the dynamo problem, such as the magnitude of the
induced current.

$p_T$ hadrons and can also cause azimuthal anisotropy of hadron spectra at
large transverse momentum in non-central high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Such
azimuthal anisotropy is studied qualitatively in a parton model for heavy-ion
collisions at the RHIC energies. The coefficient $v_2(p_T)$ of the elliptic
anisotropy at large $p_T$ is found to be very sensitive to parton energy loss.
It decreases slowly with $p_T$ contrary to its low $p_T$ behavior where $v_2$
increases very rapidly with $p_T$. The turning point signals the onset of
contributions of hard processes and the magnitude of parton energy loss. The
centrality dependence of $v_2(p_T)$ is shown to be sensitive to both size and
density dependence of the parton energy loss and the later can also be studied
via variation of the colliding energy. The anisotropy coefficient
$v_2/\epsilon$ normalized by the spatial ellipticity $\epsilon$ is found to
decrease significantly toward semi-peripheral collisions, differing from the
hydrodynamic results for low $p_T$ hadrons. Constrained by the existing WA98
experimental data at the SPS energy on parton energy loss, both hadron spectra
suppression and azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ are predicted to vanish for
$b>$7-8 fm in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$130-200 GeV when the hadron
rapidity density per unit area of the initial overlapped region is less than
what is achieved in the central $Pb+Pb$ collisions at the SPS energy.

three-body wavefunction for three, mutually interacting Coulomb particles by
including, so called, local momentum effects, which depend upon the logarithmic
gradient of the continuum, two-body Coulomb waves. Using the exact three-body
wavefunction in the region where two of the three particles remain close, a
revised description of these local momenta, is attained which predicts that a
quantum-mechanical impulse may develop in the reaction zone, causing
like-sign-charged particles to decrease their radial separation and
opposite-sign-charged particles to increase their radial separation. The
consequences of these predictions are investigated through both quantum and
semi-classical techniques where the total energy of a two-body continuum
Coulomb system in the presence of a third, mutually interacting body are
analyzed. Numerical calculations confirm that while ignoring these local
effects for light-ion-atom processes, may be appropriate, three-body effects
may dominate in the reaction zone for heavy-ion-atom processes. This hypothesis
is investigated and it is shown that a real-valued, position-dependent phase is
added to the wavefunction. Further analysis shows that one may detect
asymptotic variations in the scattering amplitudes for massive systems at
near-threshold energies. These results provide convincing theoretical and
physical evidence for a formal three-body gauge.
