investigate the spatial distribution of young stars in the Perseus, Orion A,
Orion B, and MonR2 molecular clouds. After subtracting a semi-empirical model
of the field star contamination from the observed star counts, stellar surface
density maps are used to identify compact clusters and any stellar population
found more uniformly distributed over the molecular cloud. Each cloud contains
between 2 to 7 clusters, with at least half of the cluster population found in
a single, rich cluster. In addition, a distributed stellar population is
inferred in the Orion A and MonR2 molecular clouds within the uncertainties of
the field star subtraction with a surface density between 0.013 - 0.083
arcmin**-2. The fraction of the total stellar population contained in clusters
for the nominal extinction model ranges from ~50-100% if the distributed
population is relatively young (< 10 Myr), to ~25%-70% if it is relatively old
(~100 Myr). The relatively high fraction of stars contained in clusters
regardless of the age of the distributed population, in conjunction with the
young ages generally inferred for embedded clusters in nearby molecular clouds,
indicates that a substantial fraction of the total stellar population in these
regions has formed within the past few million years in dense clusters. This
suggests that either the star formation rate in each these clouds has recently
peaked if one assumes clouds have ages > 10 Myr, or molecular clouds are
younger than typically thought if one assumes that the star formation rate has
been approximately constant in time.

formation of a quasistationary temperature distribution in the cases $\Delta_q

the heat transport within quark cores for large diquark gaps ($\Delta \gsim$ 1

MeV). For quark core neutron stars we find a time scale $\simeq 300$ years for

large gap color superconductivity. Depending on the size of the pairing gaps,
the compact star takes different paths in the ${lg}T_s $ vs. ${lg} t$ diagram

Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.67 GHz, as part of a multi-wavelength study of
a complete sample of 21 sources selected by radio flux density from the Uppsala
General Catalogue of Galaxies. We detected radio emission from all 17 galaxies.
At a FWHM resolution of ~ 10x4 mas, five galaxies show only an unresolved radio
core, ten galaxies show core-jet structures, and two galaxies show twin-jet
structures. Comparing these VLBA images with images previously obtained with
the NRAO VLA, we find that all detected VLBA jets are well-aligned on parsec
scales with the VLA jets on kilo parsec scales, and that the jet to counter-jet
surface brightness ratios, or the sidedness, decreases systematically with
increasing distance along the jet. We attribute the sidedness to the Doppler
boosting effect and its decline to the deceleration of the jets. We show that a
distribution of Lorentz factor centered near Gamma = 5 can reproduce our VLBA
detection statistics for core, core-jet and twin-jet sources. We also note that
the luminosity per unit length, L_j, of the VLBA jets drops quickly with
distance, r, along the jet, approximately as L_j being proportional to
r^(-2.0). We discuss three different mechanisms to explain this jet fading: (1)
the decrease of Doppler boosting due to jet deceleration, (2) synchrotron
losses, and (3) expansion losses in constant velocity but adiabatically
spreading jets. Mechanisms (1) and (2) are inconsistent with the observations,
while mechanism (3) is consistent with the observations provided the magnetic
field lines in the jets are aligned perpendicular to the jet axis. This implies
that the deceleration of the jets required by the Unified Scheme does not occur
on the tens of parsec scales, but must occur on larger scales.

employ a semi-analytic method, combined with three-dimensional simulations of

potentially play an important role as sinks of ionizing radiation. If
reionization occurs at sufficiently high redshifts (z_r > 20), the
intergalactic medium is heated to 10,000 K and most minihalos never form. On
the other hand, if z_r < 20, a significant fraction (>10 percent) of all

We show that this process can require a significant budget of ionizing photons;
exceeding the production by a straightforward extrapolation back in time of

radius or central velocity dispersion) and examine the detailed kinematics as
function of galactocentric distance. The merger remnants are ``observed''
through a slit along the major and minor axis, using a pixel binning and slit
width similar to the one used during the spectroscopic observations. We compare
the rotational support (v/sigma) of the merger remnants, the normalized
rotation on the minor axis and the major axis Gauss-Hermite moments h3, to that
of the observed galaxies. The N-body remnants are very flattened when viewed
edge-on (<epsilon> = 0.6) and should be inclined before making a fair
comparison with the Rix et al. data set (which has <epsilon> = 0.3). When the

detect abundance differences. Thus we compare results line by line in M33 and
Galactic stars of stellar parameters as similar as possible. Three of the four

possibilities such as a steep increase of the O abundance in the inner region

a flat O abundance profile towards the outer parts of M33. Si shows the same

represented by best localized Wannier functions forming a unitary
transformation of the Bloch functions of the narrowest partly filled energy
bands in the metals. However, as a consequence of degeneracies between the
energy bands near the Fermi level, in any metal these Wannier functions cannot
be chosen symmetry-adapted to the complete paramagnetic group M^P. Therefore,
it is proposed to use Wannier functions with the reduced symmetry of a magnetic
subgroup M of M^P [case (a)] or spin dependent Wannier functions [case (b)].
The original Heisenberg model is reinterpreted in order to understand the
pronounced symmetry of these Wannier functions. While the original model
assumes that there is exactly one electron at each atom, the extended model
postulates that in narrow bands there are as many as possible atoms occupied by
exactly one electron. However, this state with the highest possible atomiclike
character cannot be described within the adiabatic (or Born-Oppenheimer)
approximation because in the (true) nonadiabatic system the electrons move on
localized orbitals that are still symmetric on the average of time, but not at
any moment. The nonadiabatic states have the same symmetry as the adiabatic
states and determine the commutation properties of the nonadiabatic Hamiltonian
H^n. The nonadiabatic Heisenberg model is a purely group- theoretical model
which interprets the commutation properties of H^n that are explicitly given in
this paper for the two important cases (a) and (b). There is evidence that the
occurrence of these two types of Wannier functions in the band structure of a
metal is connected with the occurrence of magnetism and superconductivity,
respectively.

however discrepancies in that, in comparison to the LDA predictions, the
measured profiles are lower at low momenta, show a Fermi cutoff which is
broader, and display a tail which is higher at momenta above the Fermi
momentum. A number of simple model calculations are carried out in order to
gain insight into the nature of the underlying 3D momentum density in Al, and
the role of the Fermi surface in inducing fine structure in the CP's. The
present results when compared with those on Li show clearly that the size of
discrepancies between theoretical and experimental CP's is markedly smaller in
Al than in Li. This indicates that, with increasing electron density, the
conventional picture of the electron gas becomes more representative of the
momentum density and that shortcomings of the LDA framework in describing the
electron correlation effects become less important.

of magnetic flux carried by vortices depends on their distance to the sample
edge and can be smaller than one flux quantum, f0 = h/2e. In bulk
superconductors, this reduction of flux becomes negligible already at submicron
distances from the edge but, in thin films, the effect may survive at much
larger distances. In the absence of any experimental observation, such flux
reduction is perceived to be an exotic or unimportant effect, and it is often
assumed that magnetic field enters type-II superconductors in units of f0. Here
we report the measurements of the amount of flux associated with the entrance
of individual vortices in a superconducting film and show that the flux that
they bring in, always differs substantially from f0. We have observed vortices
that carry as little as 0.001 f0 as well as seemingly ""negative vortices"" whose
penetration leads to the expulsion of magnetic field. We distinguish two
phenomena responsible for non-quantized flux penetration: the finite-size
effect and a non-linear screening of magnetic field in the presence of a
surface barrier. The latter effect has previously not been considered but is
likely to cause non-quantized penetration in many cases.

role similar to a certificate in an NP-type proof. Specifically, we consider
quantum proofs for properties of black-box groups, which are finite groups
whose elements are encoded as strings of a given length and whose group
operations are performed by a group oracle. We prove that for an arbitrary
group oracle there exist succinct (polynomial-length) quantum proofs for the
Group Non-Membership problem that can be checked with small error in polynomial
time on a quantum computer. Classically this is impossible--it is proved that
there exists a group oracle relative to which this problem does not have
succinct proofs that can be checked classically with bounded error in
polynomial time (i.e., the problem is not in MA relative to the group oracle
constructed). By considering a certain subproblem of the Group Non-Membership
problem we obtain a simple proof that there exists an oracle relative to which
BQP is not contained in MA. Finally, we show that quantum proofs for
non-membership and classical proofs for various other group properties can be
combined to yield succinct quantum proofs for other group properties not having
succinct proofs in the classical setting, such as verifying that a number
divides the order of a group and verifying that a group is not a simple group.

features of the frequency evolution pattern reveal key properties of the
accretion event, such as the total accreted mass and the accretion rate. For
slow accretion rates the frequency evolution follows verbatim the accretion
rate, as expected from dimensional arguments. In view of the possibility of
detection of black hole ``ringing'' by the upcoming gravitational wave
experiments, the deciphering of the late time frequency dynamics may provide

originally produced in separate incoherent interactions. We present model
estimates of this effect, which indicate that the signal for deconfinement at

  At LHC energies the Debye mechanism is found to dominate for both the

play for the initial conditions taken from the self screened parton cascade

obtained by reduction and supersymmetrization of the covariant five-brane

efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling
to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive
for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables
simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the
magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of
the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially allow
the sampling to adapt to dependencies between variables by constructing local
quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by
suppressing random walks. This can be done using `overrelaxed' versions of
univariate slice sampling procedures, or by using `reflective' multivariate
slice sampling methods, which bounce off the edges of the slice.

we call causal reconnection and time-symmetric ADI, which together allow
integration of the wave equation with absolute local stability in any number of
dimensions on grids that may move very much faster than the wave speed and that
can even accelerate. These methods allow very long time-steps, are fully
second-order accurate, and offer the computational efficiency of
operator-splitting.

cryptanalytic attacks. (5) We obtain universal predictions for maximal rates

out by applying only electrical pulse sequences. Thus various error-correction

elements requires more than \frac{1}{\pi}(\ln(N)-1) queries to the list. This

  Our proof is based on a weighted all-pairs inner product argument, and it
generalizes to bounded-error quantum algorithms.
  The currently best known upper bound for exact searching is roughly 0.526

  We give an exact quantum algorithm that uses \log_3(N) + O(1) queries, which
is roughly 0.631 \log_2(N). The main principles in our algorithm are an quantum
parallel use of the classical binary search algorithm and a method that allows
basis states in superpositions to communicate.
