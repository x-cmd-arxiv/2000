8 consecutive nights of May and July 1998, respectively, and covers the
spectral range of 3100 \AA~ $< \lambda < 5100 $ \AA. The region redward and
next to the Balmer jump varies significantly on a night-to-night basis and the
amplitude of such variability decreases sharply at $\lambda >$ 4600 \AA. The
Balmer continuum slope indicates that the spectral energy distribution is
governed by a gas of temperature greater than that of the stellar photosphere.
We find an anticorrelation between the veiling and the observed Balmer jump.
The time series of the redward absorption component behaves similarly to the
veiling time series. We model the emitting region by a gas of uniform
temperature and density. The models indicate that the gas densities and the
respective temperatures are strongly anticorrelated. In addition, the model
time series show that the increase in the gas density is mirrored by an
increase of the projected emitting area (filling factor). Large/small gas
densities and filling factors are characterized by high/low observed veiling.
As the accretion rate fades from night-to-night, the observed veiling
decreases, as does the gas density and the total projected emitting area.

to estimate to what extent it may be a serious hindrance to forthcoming
experiments aimed at detecting the polarized component of Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) anisotropies. Regions were identified for which independent
data consistently indicate that depolarization must be small. The power
spectrum of the polarized emission, in terms of antenna temperature, was found
to be described by $C_{\ell}\simeq (1.2\pm 0.8)\cdot 10^{-9}\cdot (\ell /
450)^{-1.8\pm 0.3}\cdot (\nu/ 2.4{\rm GHz})^{-5.8}$ K$^{2}$, from arcminute to
degree scales. Data on larger angular scales ($\ell\le 100$) indicate a steeper
slope $\sim \ell^{-3}$. We conclude that polarized Galactic emission is
unlikely to be a serious limitation to CMB polarization measurements at the
highest frequencies of the MAP and {\sc Planck}/LFI instruments, at least for
$\ell\ge 50$ and standard cosmological models. The weak correlation between
polarization and total power and the low polarization degree of radio emission
close to the Galactic plane, found also in low-depolarization regions, is
interpreted as due to large contributions to the observed intensity from
unpolarized sources, primarily strong HII regions, concentrated on the Galactic
plane. Thus estimates of the power spectrum of total intensity at low Galactic
latitudes are not representative of the spatial distribution of Galactic
emission far from the plane. Both total power and polarized emissions show
highly significant deviations from a Gaussian distribution.

understanding of the accretion processes in galactic nuclei, particularly with
regard to properties such as the specific angular momentum distribution,
density, and temperature of the inflowing plasma. This information can be
valuable in trying to determine the origin of the Broad Line Region (BLR) in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we explore various scenarios for
the cloud formation based on the underlying principle that the source of plasma
is ultimately that portion of the gas trapped by the central black hole from
the interstellar medium. Based on what we know about the Galactic Center, it is
likely that in highly dynamic environments such as this, the supply of matter
is due mostly to stellar winds from the central cluster. Winds accreting onto a
central black hole are subjected to several disturbances capable of producing
shocks, including a Bondi-Hoyle flow, stellar wind-wind collisions, and
turbulence. Shocked gas is initially compressed and heated out of thermal
equilibrium with the ambient radiation field; a cooling instability sets in as
the gas is cooled via inverse-Compton and bremsstrahlung processes. If the
cooling time is less than the dynamical flow time through the shock region, the
gas may clump to form the clouds responsible for broad line emission seen in
many AGN spectra. Clouds produced by this process display the correct range of
densities and velocity fields seen in broad emission lines. Very importantly,
the cloud distribution agrees with the results of reverberation studies, in
which it is seen that the central line peak responds slower to continuum
changes than the line wings.

emission is from the outer edges of the visible galaxy. The overall FUV
morphology of this edge-on disk system is remarkably similar to those of the
so-called ""chain galaxies"" evident at high redshift, thus suggesting a similar
interpretation for at least some of those distant objects. FUV, U, B and V
magnitudes, measured for 48 star forming regions, along with corresponding
H-alpha and H-beta measurements are used to construct diagnostic color-color
diagrams. Although there are significant exceptions, most of the star forming
regions are less massive and older than 30 Doradus. Comparison with the
expectations from two star formation models yields ages of 2.7 to 10 Myr for
the instantaneous burst (IB) model and star formation cut-off ages of 0 to 9
Myr for the continuous star formation (CSF) model. Interpreted in terms of the
IB model the photometry implies a total created mass in the 48 star forming

formation the photometry implies a star formation rate of 0.33 solar-masses/yr.

flatspace coordnates to coordinates that move outward (near the outer boundary)
at nearly the speed of light. The outgoing radiation is compressed to nearly
the Nyquist limit of the grid where it is quenched by dissipation. The method
is implemented successfully in both spherically symmetric and axisymmetric
codes. New resonant oscillon solutions are discussed and the threshold of
expanding bubble formation is explored in both spherical and axial symmetry.
Approximate resonant oscillon solutions are obtained using trial function

systems (bosons) at low density, $\rho$, can be examined experimentally it is
appropriate to revisit some of the formulas deduced by many authors 4-5 decades
ago. One of these is that the leading term in the energy/particle is $4\pi a
\rho$ where $a$ is the scattering length of the 2-body potential. Owing to the
delicate and peculiar nature of bosonic correlations (such as the strange
$N^{7/5}$ law for charged bosons), four decades of research failed to establish
this plausible formula rigorously. The only previous lower bound for the energy
was found by Dyson in 1957, but it was 14 times too small. The correct
asymptotic formula has recently been obtained jointly with J. Yngvason and this
work will be presented. The reason behind the mathematical difficulties will be
emphasized. A different formula, postulated as late as 1971 by Schick, holds in
two-dimensions and this, too, will be shown to be correct. Another problem of
great interest is the existence of Bose-Einstein condensation, and what little
is known about this rigorously will also be discussed. With the aid of the
methodology developed to prove the lower bound for the homogeneous gas, two
other problems have been successfully addressed. One is the proof (with
Yngvason and Seiringer) that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation correctly describes
the ground state in the `traps' actually used in the experiments. The other is
a very recent proof (with Solovej) that Foldy's 1961 theory of a high density
gas of charged particles correctly describes its ground state energy.

These cross sections are parameterized with a form $\frac{d \sigma}{d X_{L}}$
$\sim(1-X_{L})^{p}$, where ${X_{L}}$ is the ratio of the longitudinal momentum
of the observed pair to the total incident beam momentum. Small value of $p$
may suggest that the number of partons participating in the reaction is large
and reaction has a strong dependence on the center-of-mass energy. We also
discuss nuclear effects observed in our kinematic region.

For quasi-elastic knockout of protons from a nucleus ($^{12}$C(p,2p) was used

struck proton in the nucleus before the reaction, from the three momenta of the
two detected protons, {\bf p$_1$} and {\bf p$_2$} and the three momentum of the
incident proton, {\bf p$_0$} : {\bf p$_f$} = {\bf p$_1$} + {\bf p$_2$} - {\bf

neutron with momentum -{\bf p$_f$} in coincidence with the two protons,
provided {\bf p$_f$} is larger than the Fermi momentum $k_F$ for the nucleus
(${\sim}$220 MeV/c for $^{12}$C). Our results reported here confirm the earlier
results from the E850 collaboration.

A",,,,"physics.optics physics.atom-ph",,"  A theory of evanescent mode atomic mirrors utilising a metallic sheet on a
dielectric substrate is described. The emphasis here is on the role of the
metallic sheet and on the evaluation of atomic trajectories using the field-
dipole orientation picture. At low intensity, the atomic reflection process is
controlled by two separate mechanisms both of which are modified by the
presence of the metallic sheet and influenced by the use of the field-dipole
orientation picture. The first mechanism involves the spontaneous force which
accelerates the atom parallel to the sheet plane. The second mechanism involves
the combined dipole plus van der Waals force which acts to repel the atom from
the surface, decelerating its motion until it attains an instantaneous halt
before changing direction away from the surface at an appr opriate turning
point in the trajectory. Various quantitative features arising from varying the
controllable parameters of the system, including screening effects as well as
desirable enhancement effects, are pointed out and discussed.

main linac is driven by the considerations of rf efficiency and dipole
wakefield suppression. As a time and cost saving measure for the JLC/NLC, the
dimensions of the 3D RDDS cell are being determined through computer modeling
to within fabrication precision so that no tuning may be needed once the
structures are assembled. The tolerances on the frequency errors for the RDDS
structure are about one MHz for the fundamental mode and a few MHz for the
dipole modes. At the X-band frequency, these correspond to errors of a micron
level on the major cell dimensions. Such a level of resolution requires highly
accurate field solvers and vast amount of computer resources. A parallel
finite-element eigensolver Omega3P was developed at SLAC that runs on massively
parallel computers such as the Cray T3E at NERSC. The code was applied in the
design of the RDDS cell dimensions that are accurate to within fabrication
precision. We will present the numerical approach of using these codes to
determine the RDDS dimensions and compare the numerical predictions with the
cold test measurements on RDDS prototypes that are diamond-turned using these

to explore some of its applications. First, we define {\em predictive
information} as the mutual information between the past and the future of a
time series, discuss its behavior as a function of the length of the series,
and explain how other quantities of interest studied previously in learning
theory - as well as in dynamical systems and statistical mechanics - emerge
from this universally definable concept. We then prove that predictive
information provides the {\em unique measure for the complexity} of dynamics
underlying the time series and show that there are classes of models
characterized by {\em power-law growth of the predictive information} that are
qualitatively more complex than any of the systems that have been investigated
before. Further, we investigate numerically the learning of a nonparametric
probability density, which is an example of a problem with power-law
complexity, and show that the proper Bayesian formulation of this problem
provides for the `Occam' factors that punish overly complex models and thus
allow one {\em to learn not only a solution within a specific model class, but
also the class itself} using the data only and with very few a priori
assumptions. We study a possible {\em information theoretic method} that
regularizes the learning of an undersampled discrete variable, and show that
learning in such a setup goes through stages of very different complexities.
Finally, we discuss how all of these ideas may be useful in various problems in
physics, statistics, and, most importantly, biology.

and long decoherence times in a quantum dots system based on nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), where the nuclear resonance is controlled by the ground state
transitions of few-electron QDs in an external magnetic field. The dynamical
evolution of these systems in the presence of environmentally-induced
