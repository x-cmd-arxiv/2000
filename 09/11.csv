period Porb = 4.1 hr for XTE J1118+480. By using a combination of Doppler

primary with a mass between 4 and 10 Msun. CaII absorption features observed at
very high resolution constrain the interstellar hydrogen absorption column
log[N_HI (cm^{-2})] ~ 20.45 +/- 0.2 and the identification of three absorbing

radio/submillmetre flux ratios imply that the dust in these galaxies is being
heated by young stars rather than AGN. We have used simple evolution models
based on our parallel SCUBA survey of the local universe to address the major
questions about the SCUBA sources: (1) what fraction of the star formation at
high redshift is hidden by dust? (2) Does the submillimetre luminosity density
reach a maximum at some redshift? (3) If the SCUBA sources are
proto-ellipticals, when exactly did ellipticals form? However, we show that the
observations are not yet good enough for definitive answers to these questions.
There are, for example, acceptable models in which 10 times as much
high-redshift star formation is hidden by dust as is seen at optical
wavelengths, but also acceptable ones in which the amount of hidden star
formation is less than that seen optically. There are acceptable models in
which very little star formation occurred before a redshift of three (as might
be expected in models of hierarchical galaxy formation), but also ones in which
30% of the stars have formed by this redshift. The key to answering these

a foreground object slightly misaligned with, and offset from, the plane of the

tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Galaxy. This
proposal, though radical, is consistent with the kinematics of the LMC and
near-infrared star count maps from the DENIS and 2MASS surveys. It does not
violate any of the observational limits on the depth and structure of the LMC
-- in particular, the reported 25 to 50 degree inclination range of the LMC and
the east-west gradient of distance moduli of standard candles. Contributions to
LMC microlensing come from the mutual lensing of stars in the disk and the
``bar'', as well as self-lensing of the disk and the ``bar''. The microlensing
optical depth of such configurations from self-lensing alone is comparable to
the observed microlensing signal reported by the EROS and MACHO groups.
Possible observations are suggested to discriminate between our misaligned,

absorption. The accuracy, determined from 125 galaxies with known spectroscopic
redshifts, is $\sigma_z\sim 0.08 (0.3)$ in the redshift intervals $z=0-1.5

distinct peak at intermediate redshifts, z~0.6 at I_{AB}<26 and z~0.8 at
I_{AB}<27.5 followed by a tail extending to z~6. We also present for the first

the different results from color selection criteria and photometric redshifts

predict a number of high z candidates in both the HDF-N and HDF-S that is
nearly 2 times larger than color selection criteria, and it is shown that this
is primarily due to the inclusion of dusty models that were discarded in the
original color selection criteria by Madau et al 1998. In several cases, the
selection of these objects is made possible by the constraints from the IR
bands. Finally, it is shown that galactic M stars may mimic z>5 candidates in
the HDF filter set and that the 4 brightest candidates at $z>5$ in the HDF-S
are indeed most likely M stars. (ABRIDGED)

The source was in its soft state during the first observation of 1996 June. In
the second observation of 1996 September, the source had parameters
characteristic to its hard state. A soft X-ray excess, a broad Fe K$\alpha$
line and Compton reflection are clearly detected in both states. The soft-state
broad-band continuum is well modeled by a disk blackbody (accounting for the
soft excess) and Compton upscattering of the disk photons by a hybrid,
thermal/non-thermal, plasma, probably forming a corona above the disk (also
giving rise to the Compton-reflection component). In the hard state, the
primary hard X-ray spectrum can be well modeled by Compton upscattering of a
weak blackbody emission by a thermal plasma at a temperature of $\sim 60$ keV.
The soft excess is then explained by thermal Comptonization of the same
blackbody emission by another hot plasma cloud characterized by a low value of
its Compton parameter. Finally, we find the characteristic ratio of the
bolometric flux in the soft state to that in the hard state to be about 3. This
value is much more compatible with theories of state transitions than the

least 57% of these pulses have HICs that can be well described by a power law.
The distribution of the power law indices, obtained by modeling the HIC of
pulses from different bursts, is broad with a mean of 1.9 and a standard
deviation of 0.7. We also compare indices among pulses from the same bursts and
find that their distribution is significantly narrower. The probability of a
random coincidence is shown to be very small. In most cases, the indices are
equal to within the uncertainties. This is particularly relevant when comparing
the external versus the internal shock models. In our analysis, we also use a
new method for studying the HIC, in which the intensity is represented by the
peak value of the E F_E spectrum. This new method gives stronger correlations
and is useful in the study of various aspects of the HIC. In particular, it
produces a better agreement between indices of different pulses within the same
burst. Also, we find that some pulses exhibit a ""track jump"" in their HICs, in
which the correlation jumps between two power laws with the same index. We
discuss the possibility that the ""track jump"" is caused by strongly overlapping
pulses. Based on our findings, the constancy of the index is proposed to be
used as a tool for pulse identification in overlapping pulses.

conceive that a single dynamical system could contain subsystems, in
significant mutual contact, possessing opposite thermodynamic arrows of time.
By examining cosmological justification for the usual arrow it is found that a
consistent way to establish such justification is by giving symmetric boundary
conditions at two (cosmologically remote) times and seeking directional
behavior in between. Once this has been demonstrated, it is seen that entropy
increase can be reversed and that the usual arrow is less totalitarian than
previously believed. In the same vein, other boundary conditions, modeling
shorter periods in the evolution of the cosmos, can be found that allow the

be solved, without need for any inflationary phase, for an observer situated
sufficiently near the symmetry center of the model to justify the ``centered

of the DBB models, the extent to which the values of the dipole and quadrupole

relation between the location of the observer in the universe and the model

our current universe to a local homogeneous pattern. However, in this case, the
centered earth approximation is no longer valid and the results of the first

on a brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, while spin 1/2 and
3/2 fermionic fields can be localized on the brane by introducing a bulk mass
term with a 'kink' profile. {}For the localization of spin 1 vector field on
the brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, it is shown that there
are essentially two ways. One way is to appeal to the Dvali-Shifman method
which is based on a peculiar feature of the non-abelian gauge dynamics such as
bulk confinement, whereas the other way is to look for a solution of Einstein
equations in such a way that the geometry has a property of confining the
vector field to the brane by a gravitational interaction as in six dimensions.

before by several authors, but the various proofs are incorrect. We give a
rigorous proof that the $n$-dimensional radial momentum operator is not self-
adjoint and has no self-adjoint extensions. The main idea of the proof is to
show that this operator is unitarily equivalent to the momentum operator on
$L^{2}[(0,\infty),dr]$ which is not self-adjoint and has no self-adjoint
extensions.

such as thermal neutron induced fission, target or projectile fragmentation and
fusion reactions. For a given radioactive ion beam (RIB), different production
modes are in competition. For each of them the cross section, the intensity of
the projectile beam and the target thickness define an upper production rate.
The final yield relies on the optimisation of the ion-source, which should be
fast and highly efficient in view of the limited production cross section, and
on obtaining a minimum diffusion time out of the target matrix or fragment
catcher to reduce decay losses. Eventually, either chemical or isobaric
selectivity is needed to confine unwanted elements near to the production site.
These considerations are discussed for pulsed or dc-driven RIB facilities and
the solutions to some of the technical challenges will be illustrated by
examples of currently produced near-drip-line elements.

considered. It is shown that the transverse dynamics of electrons contributes
to generation process and that contribution decreases with the magnetic field
grows. The equation of generation for stimulated radiation of electron beam
passing over periodic medium in magnetic field of arbitrary value is derived.
The critical value of guiding field for which the transverse dynamics of
electron don't contribute to emission is determined. It is shown, that
transverse dynamics of electron modifies the boundary conditions. It follows
from the derived generation equation that transverse dynamics yields to ~25%
increase of the increment magnitude in high gain regime. In the limit of small
signal the generation gain twice increases when transverse dynamics evolves.
Obtained results are valid for every FEL system, which use the mechanism of
waves slowing in the slow-wave structures for generation.
