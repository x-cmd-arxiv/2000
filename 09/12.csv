anisotropy in the far-infrared background (FIRB). In regions of the sky where
the thermal emission from Galactic dust is well below average, these
high-redshift correlations may be the most significant source of angular
fluctuation power over a wide range of angular scales, from about 7' to about 3
degrees, and frequencies, from about 400 to about 1000 GHz. The strength of
this signal should allow detailed studies of the statistics of the FIRB
fluctuations, including the shape of the angular power spectrum at a given
frequency and the degree of coherence between FIRB maps at different
frequencies. The FIRB correlations depend upon and hence constrain the
redshift-dependent spectral energy distributions, number counts, and clustering
bias of the galaxies and active nuclei that contribute to the background. We
quantify the accuracy to which Planck and a newly proposed balloon-borne
mission EDGE could constrain models of the high-redshift universe through the
measurement of FIRB fluctuations. We conclude that the average bias of
high-redshift galaxies could be measured to an accuracy of less than
approximately 1% or, for example, separated into 4 redshift bins with about 10%
accuracy.

morphologies and having rotation widths from 180 km/sec to 680 km/secs. For
each galaxy we have an I-band image and a 2-d H_alpha velocity field. The
distribution of mass is modeled as a sum of disk and bulge components with
distinct, constant mass-to-light ratios. No dark matter halo is included in the
fits. The models reproduce the overall structure of the rotation curves in the
majority of galaxies, providing good fits to galaxies which exhibit pronounced
structural differences in their surface brightness profiles. 75% of galaxies
for which the rotation curve is measured to R_23.5 or beyond are well fit by a
mass-traces-light model for the entire region within R_23.5. The models for
about 20% of the galaxies do not fit well; the failure of most of these models
is traced directly to non-axisymmetric structures, primarily bars but also
strong spiral arms. The median I-band M/L of the disk plus bulge is 2.4+/-0.9
h_75 in solar units, consistent with normal stellar populations. These results
require either that the mass of dark matter within the optical disk of spiral
galaxies is small, or that its distribution is very precisely coupled to the

depends on the local, rather than the global density. Since clusters populate
denser regions on average, using cluster velocities with the linear theory
scaling may lead to an overestimate of the global value of Omega. Conversely,
using linear theory with the global value of Omega to scale cluster velocities

Analytical models of the ICM often assume that the ICM is isothermal or
parametrize the TP with a polytropic index. This parameter is ajusted to
observations, but has in fact poor physical meaning for values other than 1 or
5/3, when considering monoatomic gases. In this article, I present a
theoretical model of a relaxed cluster where the TP is instead structured by
electronic thermal conduction. Neglecting cooling and heating terms, the
stationnary energy conservation equation reduces to a 2nd order differential
equation, whose resolution requires two boundary conditions, taken here as the
inner radius and the ratio between inner and outer temperature. Once these two
constants are chosen, the TP has a fixed analytical expression, which
reproduces nicely the observed ``universal'' TP obtained by Markevitch et al.
(1998) from ASCA data. Using observed X-ray surface brightnesses for two hot
clusters with spatially resolved TP, the local polytropic index and the hot gas
fraction profile are predicted and compare very well with ASCA observations
(Markevitch et al 1999). Moreover, the total density profile derived from
observed X-ray surface brightness, hydrostatic equilibrium and the
conduction-driven TP is very well fit by three analytical profiles found to
describe the structure of galactic or cluster halos in numerical simulations of

following previous work, that the dominant frequencies produced by such motions
are the azimuthal frequency \nuk, the apsidal precession frequency \nuap, and
the first overtone of the nodal precession frequency \nunp. We investigate
whether geodesics can be found for which these frequencies agree with the
observed frequencies. Correcting calculational errors made when the geodesic
precession hypothesis was first proposed, we find that \nuk and \nuap disagree
qualitatively with the frequencies of the kilohertz QPOs for infinitesimally or
even moderately eccentric geodesics. These frequencies are similar to the
frequencies of the kilohertz QPOs only for highly eccentric geodesics, with
apastron to periastron ratios \sim3--4; for these geodesics, 2\nunp differs
qualitatively from the frequencies of the low-frequency QPOs. Next we
investigate whether these frequencies would be the dominant frequencies
produced by orbiting clumps. We find that they are not and that the dominant
frequencies are instead harmonics and sidebands of the radial epicyclic
frequency \nur. Finally, we show that gas dynamical constraints restrict the
radii of orbiting clumps to be \ll 10^{-3} of the stellar radius; the
fractional modulation that could be produced by clumps is therefore \ll
10^{-6}. We conclude that there are significant difficulties in interpreting
the kilohertz and low-frequency QPOs as consequences of geodesic motion of gas

sufficient to detect 1/10 L* galaxies in the optical and 1/20 L* in the

supports the hypotheses that the absorption is either intrinsic to the QSO, or
arises in intracluster gas. Adopting either explanation is problematic: in the
first case, `associated' absorption at such high ejection velocities is hard to
understand, and challenges the conventional discrimination between intrinsic

h-1 Mpc long filament aligned along the line of sight in order to reproduce the

Lya and more narrow high ionization lines in the quasar spectrum. Here too, the
lack of galaxies at distances comparable to those found for, e.g.,

clusters undergo powerful bursts of AGN activity that produce strong radio
jets. The jets excite shock waves moving at several thousands km/sec and heat
the CF region, hence terminating it in the outer regions. The total accreted
mass due to the CF is an order of magnitude lower than the mass accreted
according to the ""standard"" CF model (which assumes an undisturbed CF for a
time equal to the age of the cluster). The scenario, therefore, brings to
agreement the observations that a large fraction of clusters harbor CFs, that
strong optical and radio activity are present only in the very inner regions of
CFs, and the lack of a satisfactory reservoir of the expected (in the standard
CF model) large mass that has been cooling over the life of the cluster.

calculations are based on standard nucleation theory and the scheme has been
first tested on the well studied case of SN1987A, yielding results that are in

predominantly made of silicates, amorphous carbon (AC), magnetite, and
corundum; ii) the largest grains are the AC ones, with sizes around 300 A,

distribution depends somewhat on the thermodynamics of the ejecta expansion and
variations in the results by a factor ~ 2 might occur within reasonable
estimates of the relevant parameters. Also, and for the same reason, the grain
size distribution, is essentially unaffected by metallicity changes. The
predictions on the amount of dust formed are very robust: for Z=0, we find that
SNe with masses in the range (12-35) Msun produce about 0.08 Msun < M_dust <
0.3 Msun of dust/SN. The above range increases by roughly 3 times as the
metallicity is increased to solar values. We discuss the implications and the

  Implications for Symmetry Restoration","20 pages, 11 figures, RevTeX",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.66.075105",,"cond-mat.str-el hep-th",,"  Symmetry restoration is usually understood as a renormalization group induced
phenomenon. In this context, the issue of whether one-loop RG equations can be
trusted in predicting symmetry restoration has recently been the subject of
much debate. Here we advocate a more pragmatic point of view and expand the
definition of symmetry restoration to encompass all situations where the
physical properties have only a weak dependence upon an anisotropy in the bare
couplings. Moreover we concentrate on universal properties, and so take a
scaling limit where the physics is well described by a field theory. In this
context, we find a large variety of models that exhibit, for all practical
purposes, symmetry restoration: even if symmetry is not restored in a strict
sense, physical properties are surprisingly insensitive to the remaining
anisotropy.
  Although we have adopted an expanded notion of symmetry restoration, we
nonetheless emphasize that the scaling limit also has implications for symmetry
restoration as a renormalization group induced phenomenon. In all the models we
considered, the scaling limit turns out to only permit bare couplings which are
nearly isotropic and small. Then the one-loop beta-function should contain all
the physics and higher loop orders can be neglected. We suggest that this
feature generalizes to more complex models. We exhibit a large class of
theories with current-current perturbations (of which the SO(8) model of
interest in two-leg Hubbard ladders/armchair carbon nanotubes is one) where the
one-loop beta-functions indicates symmetry restoration and so argue that these
results can be trusted within the scaling limit.

principle of equivalence, and (b) Gravitationally-induced modification to the
wave particle duality. In this context I note that the agreement between the
predictions of general relativity and observations of the energy loss due to
gravitational waves emitted by binary pulsars is just as impressive as the
agreement between prediction of quantum electrodynamics and the measured value
of Lamb shift in atoms. However, general relativity has not yet yielded to a
successful quantised theory. There is a widespread belief that the two thories
are incompatible at some deep level. The question is: where? Here, I show that
the conceptual foundations of the theory of general relativity and quantum
mechanics are so rich that they suggest concrete modifications into each other
in the interface region. Specifically, I consider quantum states that have no
classical counterpart and show that such states must carry an inherent
violation of the principle of equivalence. On the other hand, I show that when
gravitational effects are incorporated into the quantum measurement process one
must induce a gravitationally induced modification to the de Broglie's
wave-particle duality. The reported changes into the foundations of the two
theories are far from in-principle modifications. These are endowed with
serious implications for the understanding of the early universe and, in
certain instances, can be explored in terrestrial laboratories.

solutions display a bouncing, non-singular Universe. The model is well-behaved
with respect to tensor perturbations. But, it exhibits growing models with
respect to scalar perturbations whose maximum occurs in the bouncing. Hence,
large inhomogeneties are produced. At least for this case, a repulsive phase
may destroy homogeneity, and in this sense it may be unstable. A newtonian
analogous model is worked out; it displays qualitatively the same behaviour.
The generality of this result is discussed. In particular, it is shown that the

relativistic plasma of high energy density can appear. This process is similar
to a relativistic detonation and it can create macroscopic fireballs sufficient
for an explanation of the phenomenon of gamma-ray bursts (see e.g. the review

are magnetic vortices. They play a similar role in confining dynamics to the
role played by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.
  I give explicit derivation of the effective theory in 2+1 dimensional weekly
coupled confining models and give arguments that it remains qualitatively the
same in strongly coupled 2+1 dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in this
effective theory is a very simple classical statement about long range
interaction between topological solitons, which follows by a simple direct
classical calculation from the structure of the effective Lagrangian. I discuss
the elements of this picture which generalize to 3+1 dimensions and point to
the open questions still remaining.

The problem is relevant because many physical systems owe their Hamiltonian
structure to such brackets. A classification involves reducing all brackets to
a set of normal forms, independent under coordinate transformations, and is
achieved with the techniques of Lie algebra cohomology. For extensions of order
less than five, we find that the number of normal forms is small and they
involve no free parameters. A special extension, known as the Leibniz
extension, is shown to be the unique ``maximal'' extension.
  We derive a general method of finding Casimir invariants of Lie-Poisson
bracket extensions. The Casimir invariants of all brackets of order less than
five are explicitly computed, using the concept of `coextension.' We obtain the
Casimir invariants of Leibniz extensions of arbitrary order. We also offer some
physical insight into the nature of the Casimir invariants of compressible
reduced magnetohydrodynamics.
  We make use of the methods developed to study the stability of extensions for
given classes of Hamiltonians. This helps to elucidate the distinction between
semidirect extensions and those involving cocycles. For compressible reduced

studies number-theoretic properties of the set of integer curvatures appearing

relates the radii of curvature of four mutually tangent circles: $2 (x^2 + y^2

is classified by a certain {\em root quadruple} of integers that satisfies the
Descartes equation, and that corresponds to a particular quadruple of circles

quadruples of size below $T$. We study which integers occur in a given integer

we present evidence suggesting that the set of integer radii of curvatures that
appear in an integral Apollonian circle packing has positive density, and in

everywhere in principle discontinuous is developed for dynamical systems

proven to be orthogonal to any constant energy surface consonant with the
system energy at equilibrium. This equation does not assume the presence of

advection is given by the standard map. Fractal and random patterns in the

densities and allows an extrapolation to higher densities preserving causality.
For inhomogeneous systems, a surface term with two free parameters is added. In
addition to the Coulomb direct and exchange interaction energy, an effective
density-dependent Coulomb-nuclear correlation term is included with one more
free parameter, giving a contribution of the same order of magnitude as the
Nolen-Schiffer anomaly in Coulomb displacement energy. The root-mean-square
deviations from experimental masses and radii with the proposed LEDF come out
about a factor of two smaller than those obtained with the conventional
functionals based on the Skyrme or finite-range Gogny force, or on the
relativistic mean-field theory. The generalized variational principle is
formulated leading to the self-consistent Gor'kov equations which are solved
exactly, with physical boundary conditions both for the bound and scattering
states. With a zero-range density-dependent cutoff pairing interaction
incorporating a density-gradient term, the evolution of differential
observables such as odd-even mass differences and staggering in charge radii,
is reproduced reasonably well, including kinks at magic neutron numbers. An
extrapolation to infinite nuclear matter is discussed. We study also the dilute

long-range dipole wakefields in the accelerator structure to prevent beam break
up (BBU) and emittance degradation. The two methods of reducing the long-range
wakefields are detuning and damping. Detuning reduces the wakefields rapidly as
the dipole modes de-cohere but, with a finite number of modes, the wakefield
will grow again as the modes re-cohere. In contrast, damping suppresses the
wakefields at a longer distance. There are two principal damping schemes:
synchronous damping using HOM manifolds such as that used in the RDDS1
structure and local damping similar to that used in the CLIC structure. In a
locally damped scheme, one can obtain almost any Q value, however, the damping
can have significant effects on the accelerating mode. In this paper, we
present a medium local-damping scheme where the wakefields are controlled to
meet the BBU requirement while minimizing the degradations of the fundamental
rf parameters. We will address the load design and pulse heating issues
associated with the medium damping scheme.

measurement process. Gurvitz recently analyzed the coupling of an electron in a
double dot (DD) to a quantum point contact (QPC) detector. In this paper we
examine the dynamics of entanglement that result between the DD and QPC. The
rate of entanglement is optimized as a function of coupling when the electron
is initially in one of the dots. It decreases asymptotically towards zero with
increased coupling. The opposite behavior is observed when the DD is initially
in a superposition: the rate of entanglement increases unboundedly as the
coupling is increased. The possibility that there are conditions for which
measurement occurs versus entanglement is considered.

$C^{d}\otimes C^{d}$ shared between a sender and receiver. The following result
is proved. When the sender prepares the signal states by mutually orthogonal
unitary transformations with equal {\it a priori} probabilities, the capacity
of dense coding is maximized. It is also proved that the optimal capacity of
dense coding $\chi ^{*}$ satisfies $E_{R}(\rho)\leq \chi ^{*}\leq E_{R}(\rho
)+\log_{2}d$, where $E_{R}(\rho)$ is the relative entropy of entanglement of
the shared entangled state.

the wave equation is less singular than the one with deterministic
coefficients. We suggest some applications to quantum gravity.
