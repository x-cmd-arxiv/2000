the BeppoSAX satellite when the X-ray source was near the periastron. A flare
lasting $\sim 6 \times 10^3$ s is present at the beginning of the observation.
The luminosity during the persistent emission is $1 \times 10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, while during the flare is $2 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We
produced broad band (0.1-100 keV) energy spectra during the flare and the
persistent emission. At low energies the continuum is well fitted by a model
consisting of Comptonization of soft photons, with a temperature of $\sim 0.4$
keV, by electrons at a temperature of $\sim 1$ keV. Out of the flare a
power-law component, with photon index $\sim 3$, is dominant at energies higher
than 10 keV. This component contributes to $\sim 4%$ of the total luminosity.
During the flare its addition is not statistically significant. An absorption
edge at $\sim 8.4$ keV, with optical depth $\sim 1$, corresponding to the
K-edge of Fe XXIII-XXV, and an iron emission line at 6.7 keV are also present.
The iron line energy is in agreement with the ionization level of the
absorption edge. The hydrogen column deduced from the absorption edge is $\sim
10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, two order of magnitude larger than the absorption measured
in this source. We calculated the radius of the region originating the
comptonized seed photons, $R_W \sim 150$ km.
  We propose a scenario where $R_W$ is the inner disk radius, a highly ionized
torus surrounds the accretion disk and a magnetosphere is large up to $R_W$.
The absorption edge and the emission line could originate in the photoionized
torus, while the comptonized component originates in an inner region of the
disk.

been interpreted in previous studies as evidence of a pervasive vertical (i.e.
perpendicular to the Galactic plane) milliGauss magnetic field in the central
150 pc of the Galaxy. A simple cylindrically symmetric model for the
equilibrium in this central region is proposed in which horizontal (i.e.
parallel to the Galactic plane) magnetic fields embedded in an annular band of
partially ionized molecular material of radius 150 pc are wrapped around
vertical magnetic fields threading low-density hot plasma. The central vertical
magnetic field, which has a pressure that significantly exceeds the thermal
pressure of the medium, is confined by the weight of the molecular material.
The stability of this equilibrium is studied indirectly by analyzing a
uniformly rotating cylinder of infinite extent along the z axis in cylindrical
coordinates (r,theta,z), with low-density plasma and an axial magnetic field at
r< 150 pc, high-density plasma and an azimuthal field at r> 150 pc, and a
gravitational acceleration g* proportional to r directed in the negative-r-hat
direction. The density profile and gravity tend to destabilize the plasma, but
the plasma tends to be stabilized by rotation and magnetic tension--since the
interface between the high and low-density plasmas can not be perturbed without
bending either the horizontal or vertical field. It is shown analytically that
when beta= 8(pi)p/B^2 is small and the dense plasma is supported against
gravity primarily by rotation, the necessary and sufficient condition for
stability to k_z=0 modes is |g| < (2|Omega| a), where g = g* - Omega^2 r is the

of this source obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over a 3 year span
from 1996-1999. The data contain 38 bursts, 16 of which show NCOs. We find no
NCOs present when the inferred mass accretion rate of the system is lowest.
Furthermore, we define a measure of the strength of the oscillations and find
that this strength increases with increasing mass accretion rate. This
correlation is particularly evident within bursts detected only a few weeks
apart, and becomes less clear for bursts separated in time by several months to
years. The correlation we find for 4U 1728-34 between the NCOs and the inferred
accretion rate of the system is similar to that found for KS 1731-260 by Muno
et al. (2000), where the NCOs are only present at relatively high mass
accretion rates. However, unlike the case for KS 1731-260, we find an
anti-correlation in the bursts of 4U 1728-34 between the existence of episodes
of photospheric radius expansion and the inferred mass accretion rate of the
system. Moreover, we distinguish between NCOs present in the rise and in the
decay phase of the burst and find that the bursts with NCOs only in the decay
phase occur at intermediate accretion rates, while those with NCOs in both the
rise and the decay phases are concentrated at high inferred mass accretion
rates. We discuss these results in the context of the theory of thermonuclear
bursts and propose intrinsic differences in the neutron stars in KS 1731-260

accelerated from a stationary shock to a sonic surface. The instability is
based on a cycle of acoustic and entropic waves in this subsonic region of the
flow. When advected adiabatically inward, entropy perturbations trigger
acoustic waves propagating outward. If a shock is present at the outer
boundary, acoustic waves reaching the shock produce new entropy perturbations,
thus creating an entropic-acoustic cycle between the shock and the sonic
surface. The interplay of acoustic and entropy perturbations is estimated
analytically using a simplified model based on the compact nozzle
approximation. According to this model, the entropic-acoustic cycle is unstable
if the sound speed at the sonic surface significantly exceeds the sound speed
immediately after the shock. The growth rate scales like the inverse of the
advection time from the outer shock to the sonic point. The frequency of the
most unstable perturbations is comparable to the refraction cutoff, defined as
the frequency below which acoustic waves propagating inward are significantly
refracted outward. This generic mechanism should occur in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton

properties and the kinematics of all hot cores have been derived from the HC3N*

in two different hot cores, Sgr B2N1 and N2, with different radial velocities
and separated by 2 arcsec in declination. We find that the excitation of the
HC3N* emission in all hot cores can be represented by a single temperature and
that the linewidth of the HC3N* rotational lines arising from different
vibrational levels systematically decreases as the energy of the vibrational
level increases. The systematic trend in the linewidth is likely related to the
increase of the velocity as the distance to the exciting source increases. The
different HC3N abundances in the hot cores reflect different stages of
evolution due to time dependent chemistry and/or photo-dissociation by UV

source populations in 4 different observations: two high-redshift (z~0.5)
clusters of galaxies 3C295 and RXJ003033.2+261819; and two non-cluster fields
with similar exposure time. Surprisingly, the 0.5-2 keV source surface
densities (~900-1200 sources deg**-2 at a flux limit of 1.5x10**-15 erg
cm**-2s**-1) measured in an ~8'x8' area surrounding each cluster exceed by a
factor of ~2 the value expected on the basis of the ROSAT and Chandra
logN-logS, with a significance of ~2 sigma each, or ~3.5 sigma when the 2
fields are combined (i.e. a probability to be a statistical fluctuation of <1%
and <0.04%, respectively). The same analysis performed on the non-cluster
fields and on the outer chips of the cluster fields does NOT show evidence of
such an excess. In both cluster fields, the summed 0.5-10 keV spectrum of the
detected objects is well fitted by a power-law with Gamma~1.7 similar to AGNs
and shows no sign of intrinsic absorption. The few (~10 out of 35) optical
identifications available to date confirm that most of them are, as expected,
AGNs but the number of redshifts available is too small to allow conclusions on
their nature. We discuss possible interpretations of the overdensity in terms
of: a statistical variation of Cosmic Background sources; a concentration of
AGNs and/or powerful starburst galaxies associated with the clusters; and g
ravitational lensing of background QSO's by the galaxy clusters. All
explanations are however difficult to reconcile with the large number of excess
sources detected. Deeper X-ray observations and more redshifts measurements are
clearly required to settle the issue.

  Journal. Replaced by two-column version & indication of acceptance by the ApJ",,"10.1086/318359",,"astro-ph",,"  The luminosity function of white dwarfs is a powerful tool for studies of the
evolution and formation of the Milky Way. The (theoretical) white dwarf cooling
sequence provides a useful indicator of the evolutionary time scales involved
in the chronometry and star formation history of the galactic disk, therefore,
intrinsically faint (& old) white dwarfs in the immediate solar neighborhood
can be used to determine an upper limit for the age of the galactic disk.
  In this paper we examine the faint-end ($M_V > +14$) behavior of the disk
white dwarf luminosity function using the $1/V_{\rm max}$ method, but fully
including the effects of realistic observational errors in the derived
luminosity function. We employ a Monte Carlo approach to produce many different
realizations of the luminosity function from a given data set with
pre-specified and reasonable errors in apparent magnitude, proper-motions,
parallaxes and bolometric corrections. These realizations allow us to compute
both a mean and an expected range in the luminosity function that is compatible
with the observational errors.
  We find that current state-of-the art observational errors, mostly in the
bolometric corrections and trigonometric parallaxes, play a major role in
obliterating (real or artificial) small scale fluctuations in the luminosity
function. We also find that a better estimator of the true luminosity function
seems to be the median over simulations, rather than the mean. When using the
latter, an age for the disk of 10 Gyr or older can not be ruled out from the
sample of Leggett, Ruiz, and Bergeron (1998).

at x-ray, optical and radio wavelengths in June 1996. The x-ray observations
were performed with ASCA. The ASCA results were found to be consistent with
reanalysed data from two earlier ROSAT observations. The combined ASCA and
ROSAT data reveal an x-ray spectrum that is best fit by a broken power law with
absorber model. The break in the x-ray spectrum is interpreted, to be the
emerging importance of inverse Compton (IC) emission which dominates the ASCA
spectrum. The faint optical state reported for these observations
(m_V=18.3+/-0.25) is incompatible with the high synchrotron flux previously
detected by ROSAT. The IC emission detected by both ROSAT and ASCA was not
significantly affected by the large change in the synchrotron component. MgII
emission was detected with an equivalent width (EW) significantly different
from previously reported values. Absorption at a level of in excess of the
Galactic value was detected, indicating the possible presence of a foreground
absorber. A gravitational microlensing scenario cannot therefore be ruled out
for this blazar. B2 1308+326 could be a typical radio-selected BL Lac in terms
of peak synchrotron frequency and optical and radio variability but its high
bolometric luminosity, variable line emission and high Doppler boost factor
make it appear more like a quasar than a BL Lac. It is suggested that B2
1308+326 be considered as the prototype of this class of composite source.

differences in the positions of the peaks of the surface density distribution

inferred with the virial theorem and with the X-ray emission, what is expected
if the galaxies and the gas inside the cluster are not in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Abell 970 has a modest cooling flow, as is expected if it is out
of equilibrium as suggested by Allen (1998). We propose that cooling flows may
have an intermittent behavior, with phases of massive cooling flows being
followed by phases without significant cooling flows after the acretion of a
galaxy group massive enough to disrupt the dynamical equilibrium in the center
of the clusters. A massive cooling flow will be established again, after a new

legitimate question to ask whether the inertia of matter as a reaction force
opposing acceleration is an intrinsic or extrinsic property of matter. General
relativity specifies which geodesic path a free particle will follow, but
geometrodynamics has no mechanism for generating a reaction force for deviation
from geodesic motion. We discuss a different approach involving the
electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) of the quantum vacuum. It has been found
that certain asymmetries arise in the ZPF as perceived from an accelerating
reference frame. In such a frame the Poynting vector and momentum flux of the
ZPF become non-zero. Scattering of this quantum radiation by the quarks and
electrons in matter can result in an acceleration-dependent reaction force.
Both the ordinary and the relativistic forms of Newton's second law, the
equation of motion, can be derived from the electrodynamics of such
ZPF-particle interactions. Conjectural arguments are given why this interaction
should take place in a resonance at the Compton frequency, and how this could
simultaneously provide a physical basis for the de Broglie wavelength of a
moving particle. This affords a suggestive perspective on a deep connection
between electrodynamics, the origin of inertia and the quantum wave nature of
matter.

an accompanying burst of high energy neutrinos. Photomeson interactions produce
a burst of ~100 TeV neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB, and a burst of
\~10^18 eV neutrinos following the GRB on a time scale of 10 s. Inelastic p-n

correlated with GRBs will allow to constrain GRB progenitor models and to test
the suggestion that GRBs accelerate protons to >10^20 eV. Moreover, such
detection will allow to test for neutrino properties, e.g. flavor oscillations

virtual black hole states are allowed by the theory, as is generally the case,
then proton decay can proceed via virtual black holes. The experimental limits
on the proton lifetime place strong constraints on the quantum gravity scale
$\mnew$ (the effective Planck mass). For most theories, our constraint implies
a lower bound of $\mnew > 10^{16}$ GeV. The corresponding bound on the size of
large extra dimensions is $\ell < 10^{6/n} \times 10^{-30}$ cm, where $n$ is
the number of such dimensions. Regrettably, for most theories this limit rules
out the possibility of observing large extra dimensions at accelerators or in
millimeter scale gravity experiments. Conversely, proton decay could be
dominated by virtual black holes, providing an experimental probe to study
stringy quantum gravity physics.

which enforce local chemical equilibrium of the antiprotons with the nucleons

equilibrium with pions, nucleons and kaons on a timescale of less than 3 fm/c
when applying a similar argument for the antihyperons by considering the
inverse channel of annihilation reactions anti-Y + p to pions + kaons. These
multi-mesonic reactions easily explain the antihyperon yields at CERN-SpS
energies as advertised in pure thermal, hadronic models without the need of a
quark gluon plasma phase. In addition, the argument also applies for AGS

follows the Dyson equation approach combined with the cluster mean-field
expansion. The resulting effective few-body problem is solved within a properly

recently. Experiments were essentials carried out with microwave tunnelling,
with frustrated total internal reflection, and with gain-assisted anomalous
dispersion. According to text books a superluminal signal velocity violates
Einstein causality implying that cause and effect can be changed and time
machines known from science fiction could be constructed. This naive analysis,
however, assumes a signal to be a point in the time dimension neglecting its
finite duration. A signal is not presented by a point nor by its front, but by
its total length. On the other hand a signal energy is finite thus its
frequency band is limited, the latter is a fundamental physical property in
consequence of field quantization with quantum $h \nu$. All superluminal
experiments have been carried out with rather narrow frequency bands. The
narrow band width is a condition sine qua non to avoid pulse reshaping of the
signal due to the dispersion relation of the tunnelling barrier or of the
excited gas, respectively. In consequence of the narrow frequency band width
the time duration of the signal is long so that causality is preserved.
However, superluminal signal velocity shortens the otherwise luminal time span
between cause and effect.

the events into categories depending on the angle between bow shock normal and
interplanetary magnetic field and on the plasma-beta, i.e., the ratio of plasma
to magnetic pressure.
  Downstream of the quasi-perpendicular low-beta (beta < 0.5) bow shock we find
a dominance of the left-hand polarized component at frequencies just below the
ion cyclotron frequency with amplitudes of about 3 nT. These waves are
identified as ion cyclotron waves which grow in a low-beta regime due to the
proton temperature anisotropy. We find a strong correlation of this anisotropy
with the intensity of the left-hand polarized component. Downstream of some
nearly perpendicular high-beta (beta > 1.0) crossings mirror waves are
identified. However, there are also cases where the conditions for mirror modes
are met downstream of the nearly perpendicular shock, but no mirror waves are

$|3\epsilon(\omega)/[3\epsilon(\omega)+1]|^2$, with $\epsilon(\omega)$ being
the dielectric function of the sphere. However, local-field corrections to the
total decay rate (power loss) of the molecule are found to be much more
complex, including those to the decay rate in the infinite cavity medium, as
derived very recently by Scheel et al. [Rev. A 60, 4094 (1999)], and similiar
corrections to the cavity-induced decay rate. The results obtained can be cast
into model-independent forms. This suggests the general results for the
local-field corrections to the decay rate and to the external power loss of a
molecule in an absorbing cavity valid for molecule positions away from the
cavity walls.
