the black hole on the example of Cyg X-1 and Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. We show
that the high frequency tail of the power density spectrum can be successfully
used for determination of the black hole mass. We determine the masses of the
black holes in 6 Broad Line Seyfert 1 galaxies, 5 Narrow Line Seyfert 1
galaxies and two QSOs using available power density spectra. The proposed
scaling is clearly appropriate for other Seyfert galaxies and QSOs. In all but
1 normal Seyferts the resulting luminosity to the Eddington luminosity ratio is
smaller than 0.15, with a source MCG -6-15-30 being an exception. The
applicability of the same scaling to Narrow Line Seyfert 1 is less clear and
there may be a systematic shift between the power spectra of NLS1 and S1
galaxies of the same mass, leading to underestimation of the black hole mass.
However, both the method based on variability and the method based on spectral
fitting show that those galaxies have relatively low masses and high luminosity
to the Eddington luminosity ratio, supporting the view of those objects as
analogs of galactic sources in their high/soft or very high state based on the
overall spectral shape. Bulge masses of their host galaxies are similar to
normal Seyfert galaxies so they do not follow the black hole mass-bulge mass
relation for Seyfert galaxies, being evolutionary less advanced, as suggested
by Mathur (2000). The bulge mass-black hole mass relation in our sample is
consistent with being linear, with black hole to bulge ratio $\sim$ 0.03 %,
similar to Wandel (1999) and Laor (1998, 2001) for low mass objects but
significantly shifted from the relation of Magorrian et al. (1998) and McLure &
Dunlop (2000).

population synthesis requires a library of reliable model stellar fluxes.
Empirical libraries are limited to spectra of stars in the solar neighborhood,
with nearly solar abundances and abundance ratios. We report here a first step
towards providing a flux library that includes nonsolar abundances, based on
calculations from first principles that are calibrated empirically. We have
started with main-sequence stars, whose light dominates the mid-ultraviolet
spectrum of an old stellar system. We have calculated mid-ultraviolet spectra
for the Sun and nine nearby, near-main-sequence stars spanning metallicities
from less than 1/100 solar to greater than solar, encompassing a range of
light-element abundance enhancements. We first determined temperatures of eight
of the stars by analyzing optical echelle spectra together with the
mid-ultraviolet. Both could be matched at the same time only when models with
no convective overshoot were adopted, and only when an approximate chromosphere
was incorporated near the surface of relatively metal-rich models. Extensive
modifications to mid-UV line parameters were also required, notably the manual
assignment of approximate identifications for mid-UV lines missing from
laboratory linelists. Without recourse to additional missing opacity, these
measures suffice to reproduce in detail almost the entire mid-UV spectrum of
solar-temperature stars up to one-tenth solar metallicity, and the region from
2900A to 3100A throughout the entire metallicity range. Ramifications for
abundance determinations in individual metal-poor stars and for age-metallicity
determinations of old stellar systems are briefly discussed, with emphasis on
the predictive power of the calculations.

chondrules and other constituents into primitive body precursors. This paper
presents the main elements of this process of turbulent concentration. In the
terrestrial planet region, both the characteristic size and size distribution
of chondrules are explained. ""Fluffier"" particles would be concentrated in
nebula regions which were at a lower gas density and/or more intensely
turbulent. The spatial distribution of concentrated particle density obeys
multifractal scaling}, suggesting a close tie to the turbulent cascade process.
This scaling behavior allows predictions of the probability distributions for
concentration in the protoplanetary nebula to be made. Large concentration
factors (>10^5) are readily obtained, implying that numerous zones of particle
density significantly exceeding the gas density could exist. If most of the
available solids were actually in chondrule sized particles, the ensuing
particle mass density would become so large that the feedback effects on gas
turbulence due to mass loading could no longer be neglected. This paper
describes the process, presenting its basic elements and some implications,
without including the effects of mass loading.

from these two stars is $<$[Fe/H]$>=-$0.49 $\pm$0.22 ({\it $\pm$0.21}, with Cr

increasing optical luminosity, consistent with some degree of correlation

that only ~2% of the total CO emission at |b| < 32 deg lies outside our current

mean molecular column density decreases from ~3 E20 cm-2 at |b| = 5 deg to ~0.1

collapse if the turbulence is driven on scales smaller than the local Jeans
lengths in the densest regions, a very severe requirement (Paper I). Magnetic
fields have been suggested to support molecular clouds either magnetostatically
or via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Whereas the first mechanism would form
sheet-like clouds, the second mechanism not only could exert a pressure onto
the gas counteracting the gravitational forces, but could lead to a transfer of
turbulent kinetic energy down to smaller spatial scales via MHD wave
interactions. This turbulent magnetic cascade might provide sufficient energy
at small scales to halt local collapse.
  We test this hypothesis with MHD simulations at resolutions up to 256^3
zones, done with ZEUS-3D. We first derive a resolution criterion for
self-gravitating, magnetized gas: in order to prevent collapse of
magnetostatically supported regions due to numerical diffusion, the minimum
Jeans length must be resolved by four zones. Resolution of MHD waves increases
this requirement to roughly six zones. We then find that magnetic fields cannot
prevent local collapse unless they provide magnetostatic support. Weaker
magnetic fields do somewhat delay collapse and cause it to occur more uniformly
across the supported region in comparison to the hydrodynamical case. However,
they still cannot prevent local collapse for much longer than a global
free-fall time.

dimensions, using a galaxy catalogue constructed with a universal flat
luminosity function with $\alpha \simeq -1.0$. This is due to the projection
effects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensional
data. Many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, and
most suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected for
by subtracting random offset fields. The luminosity function of high surface
brightness galaxies in the field and within small groups follows a Schechter
function with a fairly flat faint end slope, $n(L)\propto L^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha = -0.9$ to -1.2. On the contrary, observational studies of clusters

one is based on the Anderson impurity model, with surface contributions
explicitly taken into account. The second method consists of band-structure
calculations for bulk CeFe2. The analysis based on the Anderson impurity model
gives calculated spectra in good agreement with the whole range of measured
spectra, and reveals that the Ce 4f -- Fe 3d hybridization is considerably
reduced at the surface, resulting in even stronger hybridization in the bulk
than previously thought. The band-structure calculations are ab initio
full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital calculations within the
local-spin-density approximation of the density functional. The Ce 4f electrons
were treated as itinerant band electrons. Interestingly, the Ce 4f partial
density of states obtained from the band-structure calculations also agree well
with the experimental spectra concerning both the 4f peak position and the 4f
bandwidth, if the surface effects are properly taken into account. In addition,
results, notably the partial spin magnetic moments, from the band-structure

synaptic landscape with configurations which are barely stable, and therefore
highly flexible. This allows for swift adaptation to new situations.
Recollection of past successes is achieved by punishing synapses which have
once participated in activity associated with successful outputs much less than
neurons that have never been successful. Despite its simplicity, the model can
readily learn to solve complicated nonlinear tasks, even in the presence of
noise. In particular, the learning time for the benchmark parity problem scales
algebraically with the problem size N, with an exponent $k\sim 1.4$.

number of particles used in the simulations, we present here the first values
of this important parameter, both along and normal to the plane of shear, which
have ever been obtained directly either experimentally or numerically. We show
furthermore that, although the system of equations describing the particle
motions is deterministic, the particle displacements in the two directions
normal to the bulk flow have Gaussian distributions with zero mean and, a
variance which eventually grows linearly in time thereby establishing that the
system of particles is diffusive. In addition we show that although the
particle evolution equations are, in principle, reversible, the suspension has
in fact a finite correlation time $T_c$ of the order of the inverse shear rate.
For particle concentrations up to 45%, we compute the corresponding tracer
diffusivities both from the slope of the mean square particle displacement as

operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs.
This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We
show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at
least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In
some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best
known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of
comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy,
expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid
also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a
method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise
class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH)
method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and
computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned
classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management

is represented generically by (closed or open) strings on the D3 brane
propagating in such a background. Scattering of the (matter) strings off the
D-particles causes recoil of the latter, which in turn results in a distortion
of the surrounding space-time fluid and the formation of (microscopic, i.e.
Planckian size) horizons around the defects. As a mean-field result, the
dispersion relation of the various particle excitations is modified, leading to
non-trivial optical properties of the space time, for instance a non-trivial
refractive index for the case of photons or other massless probes. Such models
make falsifiable predictions, that may be tested experimentally in the

quark antiquark pair is hard and scattered off the heat bath to form jets,
while the gluons being soft get thermalised in the heat bath. The infrared
divergences cancel in the observable cross-section to $\alpha_s$ order, which
includes the process of emission and absorption of real gluons. Since the
massless quark antiquark pair is hard the Compton scattering processes are
absent in the heat bath and it renders an uncancelled collinear divergent piece
in the cross-section. We regularize it by eliminating the collinear region from
the phase space and write it in terms of jet parameters. The temperature
dependent part of the jet cross-section is regular at large ${\sqrt{q^2}\over
T}$ and vanishes when ${\sqrt{q^2}\over T}\to \infty$. Since jets carry the
thermal signature of the hot plasma the jet production rate can be used as a

Liouville theory. Based on the resultant free field picture, we give a simple
prescription for calculating the correlation functions. The known exact two-
and three-point functions of generic primary fields are correctly obtained,
including numerical factors. We also obtain some four-point functions of
primaries by solving the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, and verify that our

the region of the broken phase is separated into two parts by the line
$\alpha_c=\alpha_c^*(=\frac{8}{\pi^2})$. The mass function is strongly
dependent upon the flavor number N for $\alpha > \alpha_c^*$, while weakly for
$\alpha < \alpha_c^*$. For $\alpha > \alpha_c^*$, the critical flavor number
$N_c$ increases as Thirring coupling $\beta$ decreases. By driving the CJT

for sonoluminescing bubbles. We present a semianalytical approach to describe
the evolution of shape perturbations in the strongly nonlinear regime of
violent collapse. The proposed approximation estimating the damping rate
produced by liquid viscosity is used to elucidate the influence of the collapse
phase on subsequent evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We
demonstrate that time derivatives of shape perturbations grow significantly as
the bubble radius vanishes, forming the dominant contribution to
destabilization during the ensuing bounce phase. By this effect the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be enhanced drastically, yielding a viable
explanation of the upper threshold of driving pressure experimentally observed
by Barber et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1380 (1994)].
