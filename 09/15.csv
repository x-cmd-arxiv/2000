the temperature of the ion is so high that the thermal broadening of the line

that the double-peaked profiles are present for high inclination angles between

in low inclination cases, and completely disappear while the inclination angle
is less than $15^{\circ}$, where the thermal and turbulent broadening dominated

self-energy losses, that cause the binary's orbital period to increase (the
effect being of first post-Newtonian (1PN) order). If the pulsar's
period-derivative is not exceedingly small, this effect can become measurable
in long-term high-precision timing measurements of the binary's orbital motion.
We use rotating compressible spheroids to obtain an approximate, explicit
expression for the orbital period derivative, due to spin-down, valid to 1PN
order. This expression can be used to observationally constrain the pulsar's
moment of inertia, and, combined with other observations, the high-density
equation of state of compact stars. We apply our expression to representative
models of millisecond pulsars in binary systems and demonstrate the importance
of including higher-order rotational effects as well as the importance of the
choice of equation of state, which both have been neglected, so far, in the
literature. The computed increase in orbital period is larger, by as much as
32%, when the higher-order rotational effects are included, while it can change
by more than a factor of two between different plausible equations of state.

before B maximum) was analysed by Fisher et al (1997), who showed that the
large width and the unusual profile of the strong line near 6000\AA can be
reproduced if the line is assumed to be due to \CII 6578, 6583\AA and if Carbon
is located in a high velocity shell. This line is one of the characterising
features of SNe Ia, and is usually thought to be due to \SiII. A Monte Carlo
spectrum synthesis code was used to investigate this suggestion further. The
result is that if a standard explosion model is used the mass enclosed in the
shell at the required high velocity (25,000--35,000 \kms) is too small to give
rise to a strong \CII line. At the same time, removing Silicon has a negative
effect on the synthetic spectrum at other wavelengths, and removing Carbon from
the lower velocity regions near the photosphere makes it difficult to reproduce
two weak lines which are naturally explained as \CII, one of them being the
line which Fisher et al (1997) suggested is responsible for the strong 6000\AA
feature. However, synthetic spectra confirm that although \SiII can reproduce
most of the observed 6000\AA line, the red wing of the line extends too far to
be compatible with a \SiII origin, and that the flat bottom of the line is also
not easy to reproduce. The best fit is obtained for a normal SN Ia abundance
mix at velocities near the photosphere (15,500-19,000 \kms) and an outer
Carbon-Silicon shell beyond 20,000 \kms. This suggests that mixing is not
complete in the outer ejecta of a SN Ia. Observations at even earlier epochs
might reveal to what extent a Carbon shell is unmixed.

of an N-dimensional vector by an su(N) algebra, where only N specially selected
generators of the algebra are nonzero. The group-theoretical structure revealed
in this way allows us to obtain a new series of conservation laws for the
equation describing the electron density evolution in the lowest Landau level.
The resulting formalism is particularly well suited to numerical simulations,
allowing us to obtain the critical exponent \nu numerically in a very simple
way. We also suggest that if the number of nonzero generators is much less than
N, the same model, in a certain intermediate time interval, describes
percolating properties of a random incompressible steady two-dimensional flow.
In other words, quantum Hall transition in a very smooth random potential
inherits certain properties of percolation.

various nonlinear Hamiltonian lattice systems. In the present paper we study
the dynamics of classical spins interacting via Heisenberg exchange on spatial
$d$-dimensional lattices (with and without the presence of single-ion
anisotropy). We show that discrete breathers exist for cases when the continuum
theory does not allow for their presence (easy-axis ferromagnets with
anisotropic exchange and easy-plane ferromagnets). We prove the existence of
localised excitations using the implicit function theorem and obtain necessary
conditions for their existence. The most interesting case is the easy-plane one
which yields excitations with locally tilted magnetisation. There is no
continuum analogue for such a solution and there exists an energy threshold for
it, which we have estimated analytically. We support our analytical results
with numerical high-precision computations, including also a stability analysis

relativistic star using a perturbation method. The present analysis is
restricted to axial modes. By calculating the energy spectrum, the waveforms
and the total energy and angular momentum of gravitational waves, we analyze
the dependence of the emitted gravitational waves on a particle spin. For a
normal neutron star, the energy spectrum has one broad peak whose
characteristic frequency corresponds to the angular velocity at the turning
point (a periastron). Since the turning point is determined by the orbital
parameter, there exists the dependence of the gravitational wave on a particle
spin. We find that the total energy of $l = 2$ gravitational waves gets larger
as the spin increases in the anti-parallel direction to the orbital angular
momentum. For an ultracompact star, in addition to such an orbital
contribution, we find the quasi-normal modes exited by a scattered particle,
whose excitation rate to gravitational waves depends on the particle spin. We
also discuss the ratio of the total angular momentum to the total energy of
gravitational waves and explain its spin dependence.

coefficients randomly. We argue that this is the correct approach when the
fundamental theory is sufficiently complicated. Assuming there is no physical
distinction among three generations of neutrinos, the probability distributions
in MNS mixing angles can be predicted independent of the choice of the measure.
This is because the mixing angles are distributed according to the Haar measure
of the Lie groups whose elements diagonalize the mass matrices. The
near-maximal mixings, as observed in the atmospheric neutrino data and as
required in the LMA solution to the solar neutrino problem, are highly
probable. A small hierarchy between the Delta m^2 for the atmospheric and the
solar neutrinos is obtained very easily; the complex seesaw case gives a
hierarchy of a factor of 20 as the most probable one, even though this
conclusion is more measure-dependent. U_{e3} has to be just below the current
limit from the CHOOZ experiment. The CP-violating parameter sin delta is
preferred to be maximal. We present a simple SU(5)-like extension of anarchy to
the charged-lepton and quark sectors which works well phenomenologically.

  This is a beautiful piece of mathematics very rich in categorical concepts,
and goes much beyond the original Galois's scope (just as Galois went much
further than the non resubility of the quintic equation). We show explicitly
how Grothendieck's abstraction corresponds to Galois work.
  We introduce some axioms and prove a theorem of characterization of the
category (topos) of actions of a discrete group. This theorem corresponds
exactly to Galois fundamental result. The theorem of Grothendieck characterizes
the category (topos) of continuous actions of a profinite topological group. We
develop a proof of this result as a ""passage into the limit'' (in an inverse
limit of topoi) of our theorem of characterization of the topos of actions of a
discrete group. We deal with the inverse limit of topoi just working with an
ordinary filtered colimit (or union) of the small categories which are their
(respective) sites of definition.

commenting briefly in the last section how to deal with the prodiscrete (not
