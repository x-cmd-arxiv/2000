dwarfs, at high spectral resolution. The spectra were gathered with the HIRES
echelle at the Keck Observatory. Some of these objects are stellar and others
are substellar (or ambiguous). Early indications that such objects can be
rapidly rotating but display little H-alpha emission turn out to be commonly
true. This is the opposite of the relation between rotation and activity in
solar-type stars. The H-alpha surface flux drops precipitously at the bottom of
the main sequence, and seems to be related to the luminosity or temperature of
the objects. There is a general trend to higher rotation velocities as one
looks at objects of lower luminosity. I discuss several possible explanations
for these results. The dynamos for these objects are probably fully turbulent,
driven by convection, and thus more directly related to the object's
luminosity. They may be quenched when the rotational velocities become too fast
in comparison to the convective velocities
  (supersaturation). Another possibility is that the atmospheres of the cooler
objects are becoming sufficiently neutral to decouple atmospheric motions from
the field. Either of these could explain why young brown dwarfs can be
magnetically active while older brown dwarfs are not. A final possibility is
that instead of being quenched, the field configuration in rapid rotators
changes to a less conducive form for dissipative heating. This could explain
why flares are occasionally seen on generally inactive objects.

inwards, using analytic arguments and three-body integrations. If the orbits of
the planet and the small body are initially circular and coplanar, the small
body is captured when it crosses the 2:1 resonance with the planet. As the
orbit shrinks it becomes more eccentric, until by the time its semimajor axis
has shrunk by a factor of four, its eccentricity reaches nearly unity
(1-e<<10^{-4}). In typical planetary systems, bodies in this high-eccentricity
phase are likely to be consumed by the central star. If they can avoid this
fate, as migration continues the inclination flips from 0 to i=180 degrees;
thereafter the eccentricity declines until the semimajor axis is a factor of
nine smaller than at capture, at which point the small body is released from
the 2:1 resonance on a nearly circular retrograde orbit. Small bodies captured
into resonance from initially inclined or eccentric orbits can also be ejected
from the system, or released from the resonance on highly eccentric polar
orbits (i\simeq 90 degrees) that are stabilized by a secular resonance. We
conclude that migration can drive much of the inner planetesimal disk into the

the ions that provide the opacity for the radiation-driven wind. Using the same

starburst and an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We now extend our study using
radio synthesis and long-baseline interferometer observations made with the

the relative contribution of starburst and AGN components to the overall

the singularities of moduli space requiring a modification of the quantization
rules. The redefinition of the Hamiltonian a la DFF corresponds to a different
