  Journal",,"10.1086/318348",,"astro-ph",,"  We revisit the problem of the formation of dense protostellar cores due to
ambipolar diffusion within magnetically supported molecular clouds, and derive
an analytical expression for the core formation timescale. The resulting
expression is similar to the canonical expression = t_{ff}^2/t_{ni} ~ 10 t_{ni}
(where t_{ff} is the free-fall time and t_{ni} is the neutral-ion collision
time), except that it is multiplied by a numerical factor C(\mu_{c0}), where
\mu_{c0} is the initial central mass-to-flux ratio normalized to the critical
value for gravitational collapse. C(\mu_{c0}) is typically ~ 1 in highly
subcritical clouds (\mu_{c0} << 1), although certain conditions allow
C(\mu_{c0}) >> 1. For clouds that are not highly subcritical, C(\mu_{c0}) can
be much less than unity, with C(\mu_{c0}) --> 0 for \mu_{c0} --> 1,
significantly reducing the time required to form a supercritical core. This,
along with recent observations of clouds with mass-to-flux ratios close to the
critical value, may reconcile the results of ambipolar diffusion models with
statistical analyses of cores and YSO's which suggest an evolutionary timescale
\~ 1 Myr for objects of mean density ~ 10^4 cm^{-3}. We compare our analytical
relation to the results of numerical simulations, and also discuss the effects
of dust grains on the core formation timescale.

material as well as hot X-ray emitting gas. The standard paradigm for the
engine geometry is a cold thin disc sandwiched between hot X-ray coronae.
Strong support for this geometry in Seyferts comes from the study of
fluorescent iron line profiles, although the evidence is not ubiquitously air
tight. The thin disc model of line profiles in AGN and in X-ray binaries should
be bench marked against other plausible possibilities. One proposed alternative
is an engine consisting of dense clouds embedded in an optically thin,
geometrically thick X-ray emitting engine. This model is further motivated by
studies of geometrically thick engines such as advection dominated accretion
flows (ADAFs). Here we compute the reprocessed iron line profiles from dense
clouds embedded in geometrically thick, optically thin X-ray emitting discs
near a Schwarzchild black hole. We consider a range of cloud distributions and
disc solutions, including ADAFs, pure radial infall, and bipolar outflows. We
find that such models can reproduce line profiles similar to those from
geometrically thin, optically thick discs and might help alleviate some of the
problems encountered from the latter.

  (France), 10 pages, LateX",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The effective quark models are employed to describe the hadronization of QCD
in the quark sector. They reveal a different structure depending on how the
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) is implemented. When the generation
of light pseudoscalar mesons is manifestly incorporated one deals with an
extension of the chiral quark model (CQM) with the non-linear realization of
chiral symmetry. If a model is built at the CSB scale by means of perturbation
theory it generalizes the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) one with chiral symmetry
broken due to attractive 4-fermion forces in the scalar channel. The matching
to high-energy QCD is realized at CSB scale by means of Chiral Sum Rules. Two
types of models are compared in their fitting of meson physics. In particular,
if the lowest scalar meson is sufficiently heavy approaching the mass of heavy
\pi'(1300) then QCD favours an effective theory which is dominated by the
simplest CQM. On the contrary, the light scalar quarkonium with a mass of order
500MeV, supports the NJL mechanism.
