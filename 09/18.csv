X-ray binaries. The latest evolutionary equations are adopted, which extend the
classical alpha theory to time-dependent thin discs with non-linear warps. We
also develop accurate, analytical expressions for the tidal torque and the
radiation torque, including self-shadowing.
  We investigate the possible non-linear dynamics of the system within the
framework of bifurcation theory. First, we re-examine the stability of an
initially flat disc to the Pringle instability. Then we compute directly the
branches of non-linear solutions representing steadily precessing discs.
Finally, we determine the stability of the non-linear solutions. Each problem
involves only ordinary differential equations, allowing a rapid, accurate and
well resolved solution.
  We find that radiation-driven warping is probably not a common occurrence in
low-mass X-ray binaries. We also find that stable, steadily precessing discs
exist for a narrow range of parameters close to the stability limit. This could
explain why so few systems show clear, repeatable `super-orbital' variations.
The best examples of such systems, Her X-1, SS 433 and LMC X-4, all lie close
to the stability limit for a reasonable choice of parameters. Systems far from
the stability limit, including Cyg X-2, Cen X-3 and SMC X-1, probably
experience quasi-periodic or chaotic variability as first noticed by Wijers &
Pringle. We show that radiation-driven warping provides a coherent and
persuasive framework but that it does not provide a generic explanation for the
long-term variabilities in all X-ray binaries.

carried away in an MHD wind dominated by Poynting flux. In the case of an
oblique rotator, a significant part of this energy can be considered to be in a
low-frequency wave, consisting of stripes of toroidal magnetic field of
alternating polarity, propagating in a region around the equatorial plane.
Magnetic reconnection in such a structure has been proposed as a mechanism for
transforming the Poynting flux into particle energy in the pulsar wind. We have
re-examined this process and conclude that the wind accelerates significantly
in the course of reconnection. This dilates the timescale over which the
reconnection process operates, so that the wind requires a much larger distance
than was previously thought in order to convert the Poynting flux to particle
flux. In the case of the Crab, the wind is still Poynting-dominated at the
radius at which a standing shock is inferred from observation. An estimate of
the radius of the termination shock for other pulsars implies that all except
the milli-second pulsars have Poynting-flux dominated winds all the way out to
the shock front.

telescope generation and the development of NIR arrays we are in the position
for the first time to develop a more detailed study by using lines other than
Lya and [OII]3727 depending on redshift. In this paper we review the main
sources of uncertainty in the interpretation of the emission line kinematics:
the presence of several kinematic components, Lya absorption by neutral
gas/dust and the contribution of scattered light to some of the lines. As an
example, several kinematic components can produce apparent, false rotation
curves. We propose methods to solve these uncertainties. We propose to extend
the methods applied to low redshift radio galaxies to investigate the nature of
the kinematics in distant radio galaxies: by means of the spectral
decomposition of the strong optical emission lines (redshifted into the NIR) we
can isolate the different kinematic components and study the emission line
ratios for the individual components. If shocks are responsible for the extreme
kinematics, we should be able to isolate a kinematic component (the shocked
gas) with large FWHM (>900 km/s), low ionization level [OIII]5007/Hb~2-4 and
weak HeII4686/Hb<0.07, together with a narrow component (~few hundred km/s)

kinematical heating of the gas supplied by stellar mass loss. In contrast,

most of the clusters were formed at the tail end of the recent starburst.
Numerous clusters in addition to the know super star clusters are similar in
luminosity to a small globular cluster. We examined the radial surface
brightness of four of the clusters. Their half-light radii and core radii are
in the range observed in present-day globular clusters. Therefore, conditions
that produced the recent starburst have also been those necessary for producing
compact, bright star clusters.
  We examine resolved stars in the outer parts of the two super star clusters.
Cluster A is dominated by bright blue stars with a small population of red

giants with Wolf-Rayet stars may instead not be a contradiction at all since
there coexistence in a coeval population is not inconsistent with the evolution
of massive stars. Cluster B is dominated by red supergiants, and this is
confirmed by the presence of the stellar CO absorption feature in an integrated

cluster B is of order 10--20 Myrs old, and cluster A is >4-5 Myrs old.

temperature dependence is found for the critical current at the first matching
field with a rectangular array of dots. The analysis of these results allows to
narrow the possible pinning mechanisms to a combination of two: the interaction
between the vortex and the magnetic moment of the dot and the proximity effect.
Moreover, for the rectangular dot array, the temperature dependence of the
crossover between the low field regime with a rectangular vortex lattice to the

bosons confined in a box of a large, but volume V, for various `ground states'
whose energy densities are almost degenerate. The ground states include the
coherent state of interacting bosons (CSIB), the number state of interacting
bosons (NSIB), and the number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons, which
interpolates between the CSIB and NSIB. It was shown previously that only the
CSIB is robust (i.e., does not decohere for a macroscopically long time)
against the leakage of bosons into an environment. We show that for the CSIB
the spatial correlation of any local operators A(r) and B(r') (which are
localized around r and r', respectively) vanishes as |r - r' | \sim V^{1/3} \to
\infty, i.e., the CSIB has the `cluster property.' In contrast, the other
ground states do not possess the cluster property. Therefore, we have
successfully shown that the robust state has the cluster property. This ensures
the consistency of the field theory of bosons with macroscopic theories.

supersymmetric grand unified model with gauge mediated and D-term supersymmetry
breaking. A Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken at the messenger scale $M\sim
10^{12}$ GeV and enables the generation of the $\mu$ term. The boundary
conditions defined at $M$ lead to a phenomenologically acceptable version of
the minimal supersymmetric standard model with novel particle phenomenology.
Either the gluino or the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP). If the gravitino is the LSP, then the gluino is the next-to-LSP (NLSP)
with a lifetime on the order of one month or longer. In either case this heavy
gluino, with mass in the range 25 - 35 GeV, can be treated as a stable particle
with respect to experiments at high energy accelerators. Given the extensive
phenomenological constraints we show that the model can only survive in a
narrow region of parameter space resulting in a light neutral Higgs with mass
$\sim 86 - 91$ GeV and $\tan\beta \sim 9 - 14$. In addition the lightest stop
and neutralino have mass $\sim 100 - 122$ GeV and $\sim 50 - 72$ GeV,
respectively. Thus the model will soon be tested. Finally, the invisible axion
resulting from PQ symmetry breaking is a cold dark matter candidate.

develop, triggering phase transitions between the different types of non-BPS

an interesting spin-off, we show that the $\IT^6/\IZ_4$ orientifold without

computer. This is particularly effective in the case of Galois groups of
p-extensions ramified at finitely many primes but unramified at the primes
above p. Such Galois groups have been regarded as amongst the most mysterious
objects in number theory. Very little has hitherto been discovered regarding
them despite their importance in studying p-adic Galois representations
unramified at p. The conjectures of Fontaine-Mazur say that they should have no
p-adic analytic quotients (equivalently, the images of the Galois
representations should always be finite), and there are generalizations due to
the first author, suggesting that they should instead have `large' actions on
certain trees.
  The idea is to modify the p-group generation algorithm so that as it goes
along, it uses number-theoretical information to eliminate groups that cannot
arise as suitable quotients of the Galois group under investigation. In the
best cases we obtain a short list of candidates for the Galois group. This
leads to various conjectures.

"math/0009256","Nigel Boston","Nigel Boston","Tree representations of Galois groups",,,,"ANT-0259","math.NT",,"  Much work has gone into matrix representations of Galois groups, but there is
a whole new class of naturally occurring representations that have as yet gone
almost unnoticed. In fact, it is well-known in various areas of mathematics
that the main sources of totally disconnected groups are matrix groups over
local fields AND automorphism groups of locally finite trees. It is perhaps
surprising then that representations of Galois groups into the latter have been
almost ignored, while at the same time Galois representations into the former
have been enormously effective in resolving long-standing problems in number
theory.
  These ``tree'' representations are important as regards topics such as the
unramified Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. This conjecture states that any p-adic
representation of the Galois group of an extension unramified at p (and
ramified at only finitely many primes) should have finite image. In other
words, p-adic representations say little about such Galois groups. This paper
proposes the conjecture that these Galois groups should, on the other hand,
have representations with large image (measured by Hausdorff dimension) in the
automorphism group of a rooted tree. Thus, they might allow us to investigate
the structure of the Galois group of infinite pro-p extensions (such as Hilbert
p-class towers), something unapproachable by standard p-adic representation
methods.

reduce to a logseries or lognormal distribution, depending on the values that
the parameters describing the model take on. A hyperbolic relationship between
the connectance of the matrix of interspecies interactions and the average

of the model at short and intermediate times is analyzed using van Kampen's

is large. Good agreement with numerical simulations is found. The large time
behavior, and the approach to the stationary state, is obtained by solving the
