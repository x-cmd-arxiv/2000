relevant to this theory of star formation, such as: observations of extended
infall in protostellar cores, estimates of evolutionary timescales ~ 1 Myr for
cores, measured mass-to-flux ratios of cores, and the relative alignment of
polarization vectors with apparent cloud elongation. It is shown that in all of
these areas, the data lie within the observationally allowable range of
parameter space. Other areas of interest (protostellar accretion rates and the
presence of core edges) and issues that remain unresolved or under study (the
role of non-thermal motions and cluster formation) are also discussed.
Moreover, we highlight some differences between our model predictions and those
of highly turbulent star formation models, and discuss how these differences

present on days 40, 49, 159, and 163. Uncorrected for interstellar polarization
(which is believed to be quite small), polarization peaks are associated with
strong P Cygni absorption troughs and nearly complete depolarization is seen
across the H-alpha emission profile. The temporal evolution of the continuum
polarization and sharp changes across lines indicate polarization intrinsic to
SN 1999em. When modeled in terms of the oblate, electron-scattering atmospheres
of Hoeflich, the observed polarization implies anasphericity of at least 7%
during the period studied. The temporal polarization increase may indicate
greater asphericity deeper into the ejecta. We discuss the implications of
asphericity on the use of type II-P supernovae as primary extragalactic
distance indicators through the expanding photosphere method (EPM). If
asphericity produces directionally dependant flux and peculiar galaxy motions

O I, S II, Si II, and Zn II. From the ion ratios, we estimate electron
densities and temperatures of the gas in these components. In addition, we
rederive column density profiles for the higher ionisation stages Al III, Si
IV, and C IV for the entire line of sight.
  Of special interest are the absorption components at positive velocities,
which are associated with the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the foreground of
M81. The medium has many gas components, as known from radio measurements,
probably released in dynamical interactions by galaxies in the M81 group. The
IUE spectra contain the only UV absorption information on such gas. We find
neutral and ionised gas absorption at the same velocity, having a metal content
similar to a galactic disk.
  We combine the spectra towards SN 1993J in M81 with those towards SN 1987A in
the LMC, the directions being essentially antipodes on the celestical sphere.
Comparing the total profile with QSO spectra, we conclude that most absorption
in QSO spectra occurs in diffuse clouds on those sight lines and is not similar
to absorption by galactic disk gas. However, one absorption component towards
SN 1993J is clearly very similar to some of the absorption components in QSO

As we have earlier observed, holmium titanate does not display ice-like
behaviour at low temperatures because the long ranged dipolar interactions
between spins are strong compared to the nearest neighbour interactions. We
show, analytically, that the true ground state of this system must be fully
ordered, but simulations only reach partially ordered states because there are
infinite energy barriers separating these from the true ground state. We also
show that the true ground state of our model of dysprosium titanate is also
fully ordered, and offer some explanations as to why simulations and
experiments show ice-like behaviour. We discuss the effect on these systems of
an applied magnetic field. Finally, we discuss several other models which show
similar partial or full ordering in their ground states, including the well
known Ising model on the fcc lattice.

(Cs-II) to a collapsed fcc phase (Cs-III) near 4.2GPa. At 4.4GPa there follows
a transition to the tetragonal Cs-IV phase. In order to investigate the lattice
vibrations in the fcc phase and seek a possible dynamical instability of the
lattice, the phonon spectra of fcc-Cs at volumes near the III-IV transition are
calculated using Savrasov's density functional linear-response LMTO method.
Compared with quasiharmonic model calculations including non-central
interatomic forces up to second neighbours, at the volume $V/V_0= 0.44$ ($V_0$
is the experimental volume of bcc-Cs with $a_0$=6.048{\AA}), the
linear-response calculations show soft intermediate wavelength
$T_{[1\bar{1}0]}[{\xi}{\xi}0]$ phonons. Similar softening is also observed for
short wavelength $L[\xi\xi\xi]$ and $L[00\xi]$ phonons and intermediate
wavelength $L[\xi\xi\xi]$ phonons. The Born-von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n analysis of
dispersion curves indicates that the interplanar force constants exhibit
oscillating behaviours against plane spacing $n$ and the large softening of
intermediate wavelength $T_{[1\bar{1}0]}[{\xi}{\xi}0]$ phonons results from a
negative (110)-interplanar force-constant $\Phi_{n=2}$. The frequencies of the
$T_{[1\bar{1}0]}[{\xi}{\xi}0]$ phonons with $\xi$ around 1/3 become imaginary
and the fcc structure becomes dynamically unstable for volumes below $0.41V_0$.
It is suggested that superstructures corresponding to the $\mathbf{q}{\neq}0$
soft mode should be present as a precursor of tetragonal Cs-IV structure.

his trajectory in space-time. Two observers at different positions belong to
different Fermi frames even if there is no relative motion between them. Use of
Fermi co-ordinates leads to several physical conclusions related to
relativistic effects seen by observers in arbitrary motion. In flat space-time,
the relativistic length seen by an observer depends only on his instantaneous
velocity, not on his acceleration or rotation. In arbitrary space-time, for any
observer the velocity of light is isotropic and equal to $c$, provided that it
is measured by propagating a light beam in a small neighbourhood of the
observer. The value of a covariant field measured at the position of the
observer depends only on his instantaneous position and velocity, not on his
acceleration. The notion of radiation is observer independent. A ""freely""
falling charge in curved space-time does not move along a geodesic and
therefore radiates.

dimension. Standard model matter multiplets and a supersymmetry-breaking (or
``hidden'') sector are confined to opposite four-dimensional boundaries while
gauge multiplets live in the bulk. The hidden sector does not contain a singlet
and the dominant contribution to gaugino masses is via anomaly-mediated
supersymmetry breaking. Scalar masses get contributions from both anomaly
mediation and a tiny hard breaking of supersymmetry by operators on the
hidden-sector boundary. These operators contribute to scalar masses at one loop
and in most of parameter space, their contribution dominates. Thus it is easy
to make all squared scalar masses positive. As no additional fields or
symmetries are required below the Planck scale, we consider this the simplest
working model of anomaly mediation. The gaugino spectrum is left untouched and
the phenomenology of the model is roughly similar to anomaly mediated
supersymmetry breaking with a universal scalar mass added. We identify the main
differences in the spectrum between this model and other approaches. We also
discuss mechanisms for generating the mu term and constraints on additional
bulk fields.

experiments. DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested
that these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems
unsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good
measure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main
bound, $p_{\rm catastrophe} < 2 \times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the
expectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper
reappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other
areas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions
are made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a
catastrophe risk no higher than $\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required
for consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization.
It is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been
significantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other
commentators. Lessons for future policy are proposed.

achieve a sub-100 fs pulse duration. The numerical simulations testify about
strong destabilizing processes in the laser resulting from a strong self-phase
modulation. The stabilization of the ultrashort pulse generation is possible
due to spectral filtering that increases the pulse duration up to 300 fs.

implemented in cases where Q is a self-adjoint operator for which zero is an
eigenvalue. In that case, the physical Hilbert space is obtained by projecting
onto the kernel of Q, i.e. H_phys = ker(Q) = ker(Q*). It is, however,
nontrivial to identify and project onto H_phys when zero is not in the point
spectrum but instead is in the continuous spectrum of Q, because in this case
the kernel of Q is empty.
  Here, we observe that the topology of the underlying Hilbert space can be
harmlessly modified in the direction perpendicular to the constraint surface in
such a way that Q becomes non-self-adjoint. This procedure then allows us to
conveniently obtain H_phys as the proper Hilbert subspace H_phys = ker(Q*), on
which one can project as usual. In the simplest case, the necessary change of
topology amounts to passing from an L^2 Hilbert space to a Sobolev space.

measuring the raw quantum information content of single messages. A general
characterization of quantum codes using the Kraus representation is given.
Compression codes are defined by their property of decreasing the expected raw
information content of a given message ensemble. Lossless quantum codes, in
contrast to lossy codes, provide the retrieval of the original data with
perfect fidelity. A general lossless coding scheme is given that translates
between two quantum alphabets. It is shown that this scheme is never
compressive. Furthermore, a lossless quantum coding scheme, analog to the
classical Huffman scheme but different from the Braunstein scheme, is
implemented, which provides optimal compression. Motivated by the concept of
lossless quantum compression, an observable is defined that measures the core
quantum information content of a particular message with respect to a given a
priori message ensemble. The average of this observable yields the von Neumann
entropy.

one qubit, the complete Bell basis can be generated. That is, states generated
by local operations are totally distinguishable. This remarkable property is
due to maximal quantum entanglement between the two particles. We present a set
of local unitary transformations that generate out of partially entangled
two-qubit state a set of four maximally distinguishable states that are
mutually equally distant. We discuss quantum dense coding based on these
alphabet states.

cloner reduces to an essentially classical device. More generally, we construct
a universal quantum circuit for distributing qudits in any dimension which acts
covariantly under generalized displacements and momentum kicks. The behavior of
this covariant distributor is controlled by its initial state. We show that
suitable choices for this initial state yield both universal cloners and
optimized cloners for limited alphabets of states whose states are related by
generalized phase-space displacements.
