in its continuum luminosity over the past ten years. In response to the
continuum change the ``classical'' broad component of Hbeta has almost
completely disappeared (a x10 decrease in flux). In its place there remains a
redshifted/redward asymmetric very broad emission line component. The
significance of this change is multifold: (1) It confirms the existence of a
distinct redshifted Very Broad Line Region (VBLR) component that persists after
the demise of the broad component and that is frequently observed, along with
the broad component, in radio-loud sources. (2) The smaller (x2) intensity
change in the Hbeta very broad component supports the previously advanced idea
that the VBLR is physically distinct and likely to arise in an optically thin
region close to the central source. (3) The presence of a strong very broad
component in the radio-quiet quasar PG1416-129 reinforces the notion that such
``population B'' quasars share similar spectroscopic (and hence geometrical and
kinematical) properties to radio-loud sources. (4) AGN can show broad, very
broad, or both line components simultaneously, making statistical comparisons
of source profile widths difficult. (5) The interpretation, in reverberation
studies, of the presence or lack of correlated response in broad line wings
will be affected by this composite BLR/VBLR structure.

Repeaters (SGRs) within the framework of magnetar, i.e., superstrongly
magnetized neutron star model, motivated by the positive period increase
associated with the August 27 event from SGR 1900+14. From the second-order
perturbation analysis of the equilibrium of the magnetic polytrope, we find
that there exist different equilibrium states separated by the energy of the
giant flares and the shift in the moment of inertia to cause the period
increase. This suggests that, if we assume that the global reconfiguration of
the internal magnetic field of $H\simg 10^{16}$ G suddenly occurs, the positive
period increase $\Delta P_t/P_t \sim 10^{-4}$ as well as the energy $\simg
10^{44}$ ergs of the giant flares may be explained. The moment of inertia can
increase with a release of energy, because the star shape deformed by the
magnetic field can be prolate rather than oblate. In this mechanism, since the
oscillation of the neutron star will be excited, a pulsation of $\sim$ ms
period in the burst profile and an emission of the gravitational waves are
expected. The gravitational waves could be detected by the planned
interferometers such as LIGO, VIRGO and LCGT.

characteristics of flux flow in type II superconductors with pinning. In
experiments, the IV relation measures flux flow down a flux density gradient.
The work presented here treats this key feature explicitly. As the vortex
repulsion weakens, the vortex pile maintains a globally steeper slope,
corresponding to a larger critical current, for the same pinning potential. In
addition, the magnitude of the peak in the differential resistance falls as the
resistance peak shifts to higher currents. The model also exhibits so-called
""IV fingerprints"", and crossover to Ohmic (linear) behavior at high currents.
Thus, many of the varieties of plastic behavior observed experimentally for
soft flux line systems in the ``peak regime'' are reproduced in numerical
simulations of the zero temperature model. The nonlinear transport behaviors
are related to the self-organized, large scale morphologies of the vortex river
flow down the slope of the vortex pile. These morphologies include isolated
filamentary channels, braided rivers, and flooded rivers. We propose that these
self-organized morphologies of flux flow down a flux gradient govern the
various plastic flow behaviors, including nonlinear IV characteristics,
observed in type II superconductors.

in Pierson et al., and conclude that both the simulations and the experiments

simulations and experiments that the change in the current-voltage (IV)
characteristics caused by the finite size shows a scaling property with an

temperature for which z=1/alpha. It is pointed out that the dynamic critical
exponent found in Pierson et al. corresponds to the exponent 1/alpha. It is
emphasized that this scaling property does not represent any true phase
transition since in reality the resistance vanishes only at zero temperature.

In this paper we present a detailed study of parameters measuring OPF for two

different patterns of replica symmetry breaking below the transition: the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with and without a field and the Ising p-spin
glass (p=3). We give numerical results and analyze the consequences which
replica equivalence imposes on these models in the infinite volume. We give
evidence for the transition in each system and discuss the character of
finite-size effects. Furthermore, a comparative study between this new family
of parameters and the usual Binder cumulant analysis shows what kind of new
information can be extracted from the finite $T$ behavior of these quantities.
The two main outcomes of this work are: 1) Parameters measuring OPF give better
estimates than the Binder cumulant for $T_c$ and even for very small systems

two competitive effects due to Polaron formation are found to be important: (i)
the screening of the Coulomb forces which destabilizes the crystal, compensated
by (ii) the increase of the carrier mass (polaron mass). The quantum melting of
the Polaron Wigner Crystal (PWC) is examined. By calculating the quantum
fluctuations of both the electrons and the polarization, we show that there is
a competition between the dissociation of the Polarons at the
insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), and a melting towards a polaron liquid. We
find that at strong coupling ($\alpha > \alpha^*$), a liquid state of polarons
cannot exist, and the IMT is driven by polaron dissociation. Next, we show that
the dipolar interactions between localized polarons are responsible for a
phonon instability of the PWC as the density increases. This provides a new
mechanism for the IMT in doped dielectrics. Examining the sign of the
dielectric constant of the PWC, we conjecture that such an instability could
yield an Insulator-to-Superconductor transition.

robot exploration.
  We propose a new measure of segment similarity called a \emph{coverage
measure}, and present efficient algorithms for maximising this measure between
sets of axis-parallel segments under translations. Our algorithms run in time
$O(n^3\polylog n)$ in the general case, and run in time $O(n^2\polylog n)$ for
the case when all segments are horizontal. In addition, we show that when
restricted to translations that are only vertical, the Hausdorff distance
between two sets of horizontal segments can be computed in time roughly
$O(n^{3/2}{\sl polylog}n)$. These algorithms form significant improvements over
the general algorithm of Chew et al. that takes time $O(n^4 \log^2 n)$. In the
second part of this paper we address the problem of matching polygonal chains.

the border between type II and type I, excluding the London limit. The masses
of the dual Abelian gauge field is expressed by the Yang-Mills gauge coupling
constant and the mass of the off-diagonal gluon of the original Yang-Mills

is common, its use for making predictions, using physical theories and prior
knowledge, suffers from a lack of formalization. We propose to introduce, in
the space of all probability distributions, two operations, the OR and the AND
operation, that bring to the space the necessary structure for making
inferences on possible values of physical parameters. While physical theories
are often asumed to be analytical, we argue that consistent inference needs to
replace analytical theories by probability distributions over the parameter
space, and we propose a systematic way of obtaining such ""theoretical
correlations"", using the OR operation on the results of physical experiments.
Predicting the outcome of an experiment or solving ""inverse problems"" are then
examples of the use of the AND operation. This leads to a simple and complete
mathematical basis for general physical inference.

induced by the interference of the one-photon exchange amplitude with the
parity-odd part of the $Z^0$-exchange amplitude, is calculated for the
$\gamma^*(Z^*)+p\to N+\pi$ processes ($\gamma^*$ is a virtual photon and $Z^*$

the standard Born contributions and vector meson ($\rho$ and $\omega$)

of the hadron electromagnetic and neutral currents, we show that the P-odd term
is the sum of two contributions. The main term is model independent and it can
be calculated exactly in terms of fundamental constants. It is found to be
linear in $Q^2$. The second term is a relatively small correction which is
determined by the isoscalar component of the electromagnetic current. Near
threshold and in the $\Delta$-region, this isoscalar part is much smaller (in
absolute value) than the isovector one: its contribution to the asymmetry
depend on the polarization state (longitudinal or transverse) of the virtual
