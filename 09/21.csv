of a Seyfert 2 galaxy, Mkn 3, obtained with the High Energy Transmission
Grating Spectrometer onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The high-energy
spectrum (lambda < 4 Ang) is dominated by reflection of the AGN continuum
radiation in a cold optically thick medium and contains bright K-alpha
fluorescent lines from iron and silicon, as well as weak, blended lines from
sulfur and magnesium. The soft X-ray emission (4 < lambda < 23 Ang) is
spatially extended along the [O III] ionization cone and shows discrete
signatures of emission following recombination and photoexcitation produced in
a warm photoionized region. The measured iron L line fluxes indicate that
emission from collisionally ionized plasma is almost completely negligible, and
does not contribute significantly to the total energy budget of the X-ray
emission. We find that significant fractions of the H- and He-like resonance
lines, as well as the observed iron L lines are produced through re-emission
from the warm absorbing medium observed in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Its X-ray
spectral properties are qualitatively consistent with those of a typical
Seyfert 1 galaxy viewed at a different orientation, and provide further
convincing evidence for the existence of an obscured Seyfert 1 nucleus in Mkn

younger ones. It is argued that the increase in velocity dispersion with time
is predominantly a gradual process rather than one induced by discrete events

of disk heating, although scattering by giant molecular clouds plays an
important moderating role. In addition to heating the disk, spiral arms cause
stars' guiding centres to diffuse radially. The speed of this diffusion is
currently controversial.
  Data from the Hipparcos satellite has made it clear that the Galaxy is by no
means in a steady state. This development enormously increases the complexity
of the models required to account for the data. There are preliminary
indications that we see in the local phase-space distribution the dynamical

fields, $B>>2.35\times 10^9$ Gauss ($1 G =10^{-4} Tesla$), as are typically
found on the surfaces of neutron stars. In such strong magnetic fields, the
Coulomb force on an electron acts as a small perturbation compared to the
magnetic force. The strong field condition can also be mimicked in laboratory
semiconductors. Because of the strong magnetic confinement of electrons
perpendicular to the field, atoms attain a much greater binding energy compared
to the zero-field case, and various other bound states become possible,
including molecular chains and three-dimensional condensed matter. This article
reviews the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and bulk matter, as well
as the thermodynamic properties of dense plasma, in strong magnetic fields,
$10^9G << B < 10^{16}G$. The focus is on the basic physical pictures and
approximate scaling relations, although various theoretical approaches and
numerical results are also discussed. For the neutron star surface composed of
light elements such as hydrogen or helium, the outermost layer constitutes a
nondegenerate, partially ionized Coulomb plasma if $B<<10^{14}G$, and may be in
the form of a condensed liquid if the magnetic field is stronger (and
temperature $<10^6$ K). For the iron surface, the outermost layer of the
neutron star can be in a gaseous or a condensed phase depending on the cohesive
property of the iron condensate.

resolve four components in a characteristic quadruple-image configuration; the

large errors in the image positions. A significantly improved fit is obtained
after the addition of a shear component, suggesting that the lensing system is
more complex and may consist of multiple deflectors. The integrated radio

the disruption of less bound systems ($W_0=3$). Models with larger $W_0$
survive this phase of evolution and then undergo core collapse and subsequent

eventually reversed when tidal limitation becomes important. The results

Sr_2Cu_3O_4Cl_2, which has two-dimensional (2D) interpenetrating Cu_I and
Cu_{II} subsystems, each forming a S=1/2 square lattice quantum Heisenberg
antiferromagnet (SLQHA). The mean-field ground state is degenerate, since the
inter-subsystem interactions are geometrically frustrated. Magnetic neutron
scattering experiments show that quantum fluctuations lift the degeneracy and
cause a 2D Ising ordering of the Cu_{II} subsystem. Due to quantum fluctuations
a dramatic increase of the Cu_I out-of-plane spin-wave gap is also observed.
The temperature dependence and the dispersion of the spin-wave energy are
quantitatively explained by spin-wave calculations which include quantum
fluctuations explicitly. The values for the nearest-neighbor superexchange
interactions between the Cu_I and Cu_{II} ions and between the Cu_{II} ions are
determined experimentally to be J_{I-II} = -10(2)meV and J_{II}= 10.5(5)meV,
respectively. Due to its small exchange interaction, J_{II}, the 2D dispersion
of the Cu_{II} SLQHA can be measured over the whole Brillouin zone with thermal
neutrons, and a novel dispersion at the zone boundary, predicted by theory, is
confirmed. The instantaneous magnetic correlation length of the Cu_{II} SLQHA
is obtained up to a very high temperature, T/J_{II}\approx 0.75. This result is

eight-state system on a cubic site, the elastic response function shows a
biexponential relaxation feature and a van Vleck type contribution with a
resonance frequency that is twice the tunnel frequency $\Delta/\hbar$. This
basically differs from the dielectric response that does not show relaxation.
Moreover, we show that the elastic response of a [111] impurity cannot be
reduced to that of a two-level system. In the experimental part, we report on
recent sound velocity and internal friction measurements on KCl doped with
cyanide at various concentrations. At low doping (45 ppm) we find the dynamics

effects of confinement on the transition to superconductivity for type-I and
type-II materials with surface enhancement. The superconducting order parameter
is characterized by a negative surface extrapolation length $b$. This leads to
an increase of the critical field $H_{c3}$ and to a surface critical
temperature in zero field, $T_{cs}$, which exceeds the bulk $T_c$. When the
sample is {\em mesoscopic} of linear size $L$ the surface induces
superconductivity in the interior for $T < T_{c}(L)$, with $T_c(L) > T_{cs}$.
In analogy with adsorbed fluids, superconductivity in thin films of type-I
materials is akin to {\em capillary condensation} and competes with the
interface delocalization or ""wetting"" transition. The finite-size scaling
properties of capillary condensation in superconductors are scrutinized in the
limit that the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to superconducting coherence
length, $\kappa \equiv \lambda/\xi $, goes to zero, using analytic
calculations. While standard finite-size scaling holds for the transition in
non-zero magnetic field $H$, an anomalous critical-point shift is found for
H=0. The increase of $T_c$ for H=0 is calculated for mesoscopic films,
cylindrical wires, and spherical grains of type-I and type-II materials.
Surface curvature is shown to induce a significant increase of $T_c$,
characterized by a shift $T_c(R)-T_c(\infty)$ inversely proportional to the
radius $R$.

field theory, and correspondingly the bulk vector is dual to a linear anomaly
multiplet. Generic features of the fluctuation equations and solutions are

harmonic oscillator have been addressed. In this paper we investigate the
consequences of some of these algebras for macroscopic systems. The key point
of our analysis lies in the fact that the modification of the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations present in these theories changes the volume of the
elementary cell in the hamiltonian phase space and so the measure needed to
compute partition functions.
  The thermodynamics of a non interacting gas are studied for two members of
the Kempf-Mangano-Mann (K.M.M.) deformations. It is shown that the theory which
exhibits a minimal uncertainty in length predicts a new behavior at high
temperature while the one with a minimal uncertainty in momentum displays
unusual features for huge volumes. In the second model negative pressures are
obtained and mixing two different gases does not necessarily increase the
entropy . This suggests a possible violation of the second law of
thermodynamics. Potential consequences of these models in the evolution of the
early universe are briefly discussed.
  Constructing the Einstein model of a solid for the q deformed oscillator, we
find that the subset of eigenstates whose energies are bounded from above leads

exact few-body calculations and microscopic nuclear many-body theory. I will
critically analyses those models and point out their strenghts and weaknesses.
Particular emphasis will be on charge dependence. Other recent research was
conducted on a more basic level: understanding the nuclear force in terms of
the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD. Predictions from this
sector are typically qualitative in nature. Thus, the main problem of the
current status in the field is that quantitative models for the nuclear force
have a poor theoretical background, while theory based models yield poor
results. The chief challenge for the new millenium is to overcome this
discrepancy. Chiral effective field theory may be a suitable tool to solve the
problem.

harmonic trap and at zero temperature are studied. Exact expressions and
asymptotic results for large Fermion number N are given for the particle
density distribution n_0(z,N). For large N and near the classical boundary at
the Fermi energy the density displays increasing fluctuations. A simple scaling
of these tails of the density distribution with respect to N is established.
The Fourier transform of the density distribution is calculated exactly. It
displays a small but characteristic hump near 2 k_F with k_F being a properly
defined Fermi wave number. This is due to Friedel oscillations which are
identified and discussed. These quantum effects are missing in the
semi-classical approximation. Momentum distributions are also evaluated and
discussed. As an example of a time-dependent one-particle problem we calculate
exactly the evolution of the particle density when the trap is suddenly
switched off and find a simple scaling behaviour in agreement with recent
general results.

communication required to simulate entangled quantum systems with classical
information. The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from
a set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that
reproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is
measured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a
finite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell
state. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the
communication is merely required to be finite {\em on average}, Bell states can
be simulated {\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show
that arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell
states can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average
(again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the
communication is required to be {\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite
number of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell
state. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic
communication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the
quantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.
