oscillations (QPOs) that occurred during 1997 RXTE observations of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105 in the low-hard state. The high count rates allow us
to track individual QPO peaks, and we exploit this to develop a QPO folding
technique. In contrast to previous QPO studies with RXTE, we emphasize the high
energy QPO properties and report the detection of a QPO in the 60-124 keV
energy band. Our technique allows us, for the first time, to measure the phase
of the QPO harmonics relative to the fundamental. Variation in this phase
difference leads to changes in the shape of the QPO profile with energy and
over time. The strength of the QPO fundamental increases up to 19 keV, but the
data do not suggest that the strength continues to increase above this energy.
In some cases, the QPO amplitudes in the 30-60 keV and 60-124 keV energy bands
are significantly less than in the 13-19 keV and 19-29 keV energy bands. We
also use our technique to measure the phase lag of the QPO fundamental and
harmonics. In the case where negative phase lags are detected for the
fundamental, positive phase lags are detected for the first harmonic.

continuum flux at 1450 Angstroms decreased by factor of about four over the
previous two years and there was a corresponding dramatic increase in the
column densities of the low-ionization absorption lines (e.g., Si II, Fe II,
and Al II), presumably as a result of a decrease in the ionizing continuum. In
addition to the absorption lines seen in previous low states, we identify a
large number of Fe II absorption lines that arise from metastable levels as
high as 4.1 eV above the ground state, indicating high densities (> 10^6

broad C IV emission, seen in a Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph spectrum

fine-structure absorption line at a radial velocity of -560 km/s (relative to
systemic). We also demonstrate that the ``satellite'' emission lines of C~IV
found in International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra are actually regions of
unabsorbed continuum plus broad emission that become prominent when the UV
continuum of NGC 4151 is in a low state.

few have Lya equivalent widths that are substantially weaker in relation to
other emission lines. One in particular was studied by Dey etal (1995), MG
1019+0535 (z=2.765). We report on our reduction of Infrared Space Observatory

on two other high redshift active galaxies with weak Lya lines, the radio
galaxy TXS 0211-122, and the AGN-starburst galaxy F 10214+4724, to provide a
small weak-Lya line sample. IRAS plus ISO data show that F 10214+4724 has a
temperature 89 +/- 12 K. TXS 0211-122 was not detected in either the
submillimeter or microwave. Submillimeter measurements of MG 1019+0535 (Cimatti
etal 1998) were suggestive of a dust temperature in the range 35 K < T_d < 80
K. However our 2-sigma upper limit on the flux at 160 microns shows that T_d <~
32 K. An energy argument based on observations which constrain the total
optical extinction strongly suggests that the dust temperature must be even
lower; T_d <~ 20 K. We find the contrast between the high-temperature dust in
the active starburst galaxy and the low-temperature dust in the evolved, albeit
active galaxy, is consistent with an expanding cloud of dust. We find that the
temperature range can be reconciled if we are seeing MG 1019+0535 at a
post-starburst age of approx. 500-700 Myr, with the bulk of its dust cloud at a

rare and spectacular clusters that are easy targets for lensing work, we
selected an ensemble of much more common clusters with moderate X-ray
luminosity. Although the survey is still in progress, two conclusions are
emerging: (1) within a cluster, mass follows light very closely on the angular
scales that we can measure, $0.2-2h^{-1}$ Mpc, and (2) there is a significant
cluster-to-cluster scatter in mass-to-light (M/L) ratios despite uniformity of
observing, reduction, and analysis procedures. We also derive an estimate of
$\Omega_{matter}$ based on extrapolation from the mass properties of these
typical clusters. Finally, we discuss the discovery of other clusters in our

observational constraints. These are obtained from photospheric light scattered
in near-IR vibrational-rotational lines of circumstellar CO molecules at 4.6
micron: absolute fluxes, the radial dependence of the scattered intensity, and
two line ratios. Further observational constraints are provided by ISO
observations of far-IR emission lines from highly excited rotational states of
the ground vibrational state of CO, and radio observations of lines from
rotational levels of low excitation of CO. A code based on the Monte-Carlo
technique is used to model the circumstellar line emission.
  We find that it is possible to model the radio and ISO fluxes, as well as the
highly asymmetric radio-line profiles, reasonably well with a spherically
symmetric and smooth stellar wind model. However, it is not possible to
reproduce the observed NIR line fluxes consistently with a `standard model' of
the stellar wind. This is probably due to incorrectly specified conditions of
the inner regions of the wind model, since the stellar flux needs to be larger
than what is obtained from the standard model at the point of scattering, i.e.,
the intermediate regions at approximately 100-400 stellar radii (2""-7"") away
from the star. Thus, the optical depth in the vibrational-rotational lines from
the star to the point of scattering has to be decreased. This can be
accomplished in several ways. For instance, the gas close to the star (within
approximately 2"") could be in such a form that light is able to pass through,
either due to the medium being clumpy or by the matter being in radial
structures (which, further out, developes into more smooth or shell-like
structures).

Hubble-type index at $>$99.99% significance level. As $L_{\FIR}/L_{\B}$ and
f(25\micron)/f(60\micron) are considered as the indicators of star-formation
activity and AGN activity, respectively, our result suggests that LINERs with
higher AGN activity may have a lower star-formation contribution. The ones with
highest AGN activity and lowest star-formation contributions are ellipticals.
All well-studied LINER 1s belong to this group. On the other hand, LINERs with
higher star-formation activity present lower AGN contributions. We find all
well-studied LINER 2s in this parameter space. Most of LINERs having inner ring
structures belong to this group. Statistics with other indicators of
star-formation or AGN activity (nulear mass-to-light ratio at H band, and the
ratio of X-ray-to-UV power) provide further evidence for such a trend. We have
seen that along with the evolution of galaxies from late-type spirals to
early-type ones, and up to ellipticals, the intensity of AGN activity increases
with decreasing star-formation contributions, The above analyses may suggest a
possible connection between the host galaxies and nuclear activities, and it
might also indicate a possible evolutionary connection between AGN and
starburst in LINERs.

These non-Gaussian simulations are obtained as perturbations of a Gaussian
field in two different ways which introduce a small level of skewness or
kurtosis in the distribution. A comparison with a classical estimator, the
genus, is also shown. We find that the Gaussian curvature is the best of our
estimators in all the considered cases. Therefore we propose the use of this

of Galactic giant molecular clouds. We also estimate the cloud sizes to be
10-30 pc, implying masses greater than about 1e+5 solar masses. This strongly
suggests that gamma-ray bursts lie within star forming regions, and therefore
argues against neutron star mergers and for collapses of massive stars as their
sources. The optical extinctions, however, are 10-100 times smaller than
expected from the high column densities. This confirms theoretical findings
that the early hard radiation from gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows can
destroy the dust in their environment, thus carving a path for the afterglow
light out of the molecular cloud. Because of the self-created low extinction
and location in star-forming regions, we expect gamma-ray bursts to provide a

We follow the standard Chapman-Enskog procedure, starting from a solution of
the kinetic equation corresponding to the complete local equilibrium between
the condensate and the non-condensate components. Our hydrodynamic equations
are shown to reduce to a form identical to the well-known Landau-Khalatnikov
two-fluid equations, with hydrodynamic damping due to the deviation from local
equilibrium. The deviation from local equilibrium within the thermal cloud
gives rise to dissipation associated with shear viscosity and thermal
conduction. In addition, we show that effects due to the deviation from the
diffusive local equilibrium between the condensate and the non-condensate
(recently considered by Zaremba, Nikuni and Griffin) can be described by four
frequency-dependent second viscosity transport coefficients. We also derive
explicit formulas for all the transport coefficients. These results are used to
introduce two new characteristic relaxation times associated with hydrodynamic
damping. These relaxation times give the rate at which local equilibrium is
reached and hence determine whether one is in the two-fluid hydrodynamic

effect of model gold contacts on this conductance. Then, we compute the effect
of introducing a single, two, and three oxygen atom impurities. We find that
the conductance of a single-oxygen-doped (6,6) nanotube decreases by about 30 %
with respect to that of the perfect nanotube. The presence of a second doping
atom induces strong changes of the conductance which, however, depend very
strongly on the relative position of the two oxygen atoms. We observe regular
oscillations of the conductance that repeat over an O-O distance that
corresponds to an integral number of half Fermi-wavelengths ($m\lambda_F/2$).
These fluctuations reflect strong electron interference phenomena produced by
electron scattering from the oxygen defects whose contribution to the
resistance of the tube cannot be obtained by simply summing up their individual
contributions.

(Appl. Phys. Lett. 74, 2059 (1999)) poses a challenge to this theory. Here, we
confirm that the sixth-order Devonshire theory cannot support a monoclinic
phase, and consider extensions of the theory to higher orders. We show that an
eighth-order theory allows for three kinds of equilibrium phases in which the
polarization is confined not to a symmetry axis but to a symmetry plane. One of
these phases provides a natural description of the newly observed monoclinic
phase. Moreover, the theory makes testable predictions about the nature of the
phase boundaries between monoclinic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral phases. A
ferroelectric phase of the lowest (triclinic) symmetry type, in which the
polarization is not constrained by symmetry, does not emerge until the
Devonshire theory is carried to twelfth order. A topological analysis of the
critical points of the free-energy surface facilitates the discussion of the
phase transition sequences.

violate all of the standard energy conditions in general relativity. Violations
of the null and averaged null energy conditions obtainable with such fields
have been suggested as possible exotic matter candidates required for the
maintenance of traversable wormholes. In this paper, we explore the possibility
that if such fields exist, they might be used to produce large negative energy
fluxes and macroscopic violations of the generalized second law (GSL) of
thermodynamics. We find that it appears to be very easy to produce large
magnitude negative energy fluxes in flat spacetime. However we also find,
somewhat surprisingly, that these same types of fluxes injected into a black
hole do {\it not} produce violations of the GSL. This is true even in cases
where the flux results in a decrease in the area of the horizon. We demonstrate
that two effects are responsible for the rescue of the GSL: the acausal

presented for the detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact
binaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors having arbitrary
orientations and arbitrary locations around the globe. The MLM is based on the
network likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters
that determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the
LR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is
possible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.
Maximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most
efficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to
scan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts
down substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the
remaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the
construction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space. After
obtaining the network statistic, we first discuss `idealized' networks with all
the detectors having a common noise curve for simplicity. Such an exercise
nevertheless yields useful estimates about computational costs, and also tests
the formalism developed here. We then consider realistic cases of networks
comprising of the LIGO and VIRGO detectors: These include two-detector
networks, which pair up the two LIGOs or VIRGO with one of the LIGOs, and the
three-detector network that includes VIRGO and both the LIGOs. For these
networks we present the computational speed requirements, network
sensitivities, and source-direction resolutions.

  We encounter instabilities similar to those encountered is earlier
calculations, but in our case these are not fatal and we are able to simulate
through this process with a global energy loss of less than 8%, and to identify
robust features of the final radiation pattern. The system passes through a
singular configuration at the time of half-annihilation. This is followed by
the onset of fast oscillations which are superimposed on the smoother process
which leads to the appearence of outgoing spherical waves.
  We investigate the two prominent features of this process, the proliferation
of small, fast oscillations, and the singular intermediate configuration. We
find that our equations of motion allow for a regime in which the amplitude of
certain small perturbations increases exponentially. This regime is similar but
not identical to the situation pointed out earlier regarding the original
Skyrme model. We argue that the singularity may be seen as the result of a

decrease pulse duration and reduce the mode locking threshold

hyperbolic equations, focusing on a method which has second order precision
both in time and space (the so-called staggered leapfrog method) and applying
it to the case of the 1d and 2d wave equation. A brief derivation of the energy
and equation of motion of a wave is done before the numerical part in order to
make the transition from the continuum to the lattice clearer. To illustrate
the extension of the method to more complex equations, I also add dissipative
terms of the kind $-\eta \dot{u}$ into the equations. The von Neumann numerical
stability analysis and the Courant criterion, two of the most popular in the
literature, are briefly discussed. In the end I present some numerical results
obtained with the leapfrog algorithm, illustrating the importance of the
lattice resolution through energy plots.

  proceedings",,,,"quant-ph physics.bio-ph",,"  A model is presented for dissipationless energy transfer in cell microtubules
due to quantum coherent states. The model is based on conjectured (hydrated)
ferroelectric properties of microtubular arrangements. Ferroelectricity is
essential in providing the necessary isolation against thermal losses in thin
interior regions, full of ordered water, near the tubulin dimer walls of the
microtubule. These play the role of cavity regions, which are similar to
electromagnetic cavities of quantum optics. As a result, the formation of
(macroscopic) quantum coherent states of electric dipoles on the tubulin dimers
may occur. Some experiments, inspired by quantum optics, are suggested for the
falsification of this scenario.

  unchanged",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.65.022107",,"quant-ph",,"  Every entangled state can be perturbed, for instance by decoherence, and stay
entangled. For a large class of pure entangled states, we show how large the
perturbation can be. Our class includes all pure bipartite and all maximally
entangled states. For an entangled state, E, the constucted neighborhood of
entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich
the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are
largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the
dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the
distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states
goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of
entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check
if the trace of EQ is greater than a constant which depends upon E and which we
determine.
