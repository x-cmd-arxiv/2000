  Hibbard, M.P. Rupen, & J.H. van Gorkom, ASP Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the last several years, a number of compact extragalactic radio sources
have been found to exhibit neutral hydrogen absorption at or near the systemic
velocities of their host galaxies. Models proposed to explain this phenomenon
involve a circumnuclear torus of gas and dust. The orientation of this
structure determines whether or not the central engine appears obscured.
Understanding the spatial distribution and kinematics of the HI detected toward
the central parsecs of these sources provides an important test of this model
and of unified schemes for AGN.
  We present results of Global VLBI Network observations of the redshifted 21
cm HI line toward the Compact Symmetric Object 1946+708 (z=0.101). This source
is of particular interest because it exhibits bi-directional motion measurable
on timescales of a few years. The resulting unique information about the
geometry of the continuum source greatly assists in the interpretation of the
HI distribution. We find significant structure in the gas on parsec scales. The
peak column density of the HI occurs near the center of activity of the source,
as does the highest velocity dispersion (FWHM ~ 350 to 400 km/s). The
distribution of gas in 1946+708 is strongly suggestive of a circumnuclear torus
of atomic material with one or more additional compact clumps of gas along the
line of sight to the approaching jet.

compact radio sources. The observations are part of a large survey undertaken
to identify CSOs Observed in the Northern Sky (COINS). Based on VLBI continuum
surveys of ~2000 compact radio sources, we have defined a sample of 52 CSOs and
CSO candidates. Positive identification of CSOs is contingent upon acquiring
multi-frequency observations in order to correctly identify the core of the
source, which is expected to have a strongly inverted spectrum. We also expect
CSOs to exhibit very little polarized flux. Despite the fact that synchrotron
emission is intrinsically highly polarized, less than 0.5% fractional
polarization is seen in low resolution studies of CSOs at frequencies up to 5
GHz. One possible explanation for the low observed linear polarization from
CSOs is that their radiation is depolarized as it passes through a magnetized
plasma associated with a circumnuclear torus. This interpretation is consistent
with the unified scheme of AGN, and also with the recent detections of
free-free and HI absorption in CSOs.
  Here we present limits on the polarized flux density at 8.4 GHz and ~1 mas
resolution for 21 CSOs and candidates in the COINS sample.

continuum and/or softer far-ultraviolet radiation fields of nearby high mass

seven lie near the reflection nebula NGC 1333 in the Perseus molecular cloud.
We propose that the UV radiation field has eroded residual material left over
from the formation of these young source stars. Many of the irradiated jets
exhibit unusual C-shaped bending. In the outskirts of the Orion Nebula, most
irradiated jets bend away from the core of the nebula. On the other hand, in
NGC 1333, the C-shaped jets bend back towards the cluster center. Jet bending
in the Orion Nebula may be dominated by either the outflow of material from the
nebular core or by the rocket effect pushing on the irradiated portion of a
mostly neutral jet beam. But in NGC 1333, jet bending may indicate that the
source stars have been ejected from the cluster core. Many irradiated jets are
asymmetric with one beam much brighter than the other. When fully
photo-ionized, irradiated jets may provide unique insights into the physical
conditions within outflows powered by young stars, permitting the determination
of the density and location of stellar ejecta even in the absence of shocks. We
present a model for the photo-ionization of these outflows by external
radiation fields and discuss possible mechanisms for producing the observed
asymmetries. We demonstrate that the UV radiation field may alter the amount of
cloud material entrained by the jet. We also report the discovery of some large
scale bow shocks which face the core of the Orion Nebula and which surround
visible young stars. These wind-wind collision fronts provide further evidence
for a large scale mass flow originating near the nebular core.

if the edges are required to be line segments (as opposed to Jordan curves). We
assume no three vertices are collinear. The rectilinear crossing number of G is
the fewest number of edge crossings attainable over all rectilinear drawings of
G. Thanks to Richard Guy, exact values of the rectilinear crossing number of
K_n, the complete graph on n vertices, for n = 3,...,9, are known (Guy 1972,
White and Beinke 1978, Finch 2000, Sloanes A014540). Since 1971, thanks to the
work of David Singer (1971, Gardiner 1986), the rectilinear crossing number of

tantalizing statement. The difficulty of determining the correct value is
evidenced by the fact that Singer's result has withstood the test of time. In
this paper we use a purely combinatorial argument to show that the rectilinear

asymptotic lower bound for a related problem. Finally, we close with some new

Assuming an infrared fixed point persists in the perturbative part of the QCD

restricts the partial waves to analytical functions with very specific form of

boundary a conformally invariant dynamics that can be described in terms of a
de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model coupled to an external source with conformal
dimension two. The external source encodes the information about the gauge
symmetries of the 2D gravity system. Alternatively, there exists a description
in terms of a mechanical system with anholonomic constraints. The considered
systems are invariant under the action of the conformal group generated by a
Virasoro algebra, which occurs also as asymptotic symmetry algebra of
two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We calculate the central charge of the
algebra and find perfect agreement between statistical and thermodynamical
entropy of AdS_2 black holes.

This is different from recently presented strategies,where the cavity is
supposed to be initially empty and the field is built up photon by photon
through resonant atom-field interactions. Here, a coherent state is previously
injected into the cavity. So, the Wigner distribution function of the desired
state is constructed from that of the initially coherent state. Such an
engineering process is achieved through an adaptation of the recently proposed
technique of projection synthesis to cavity QED phenomena.

incompatible quantities. Complete determination of the path will exclude any
possibility of interference, rendering the visibility zero. However, if the
composite object and probe state is pure, it is, under certain conditions,
possible to trade the path information for improved (conditioned) visibility.
Such a procedure is called quantum erasure. We have performed such experiments
with polarization entangled photon pairs. Using a partial polarizer we could
vary the degree of entanglement between object and probe. We could also vary
the interferometer splitting ratio and thereby vary the a priori path
predictability. We have tested quantum erasure under a number of different
experimental conditions and found good agreement between experiments and
theory.
