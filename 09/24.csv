  available at http://www.na.astro.it/~andreon/listapub.html",,"10.1086/318381",,"astro-ph",,"  The deep near-infrared luminosity function of AC118, a cluster of galaxies at
z=0.3, is presented. AC118 is a bimodal cluster, as evidenced both by our
near-infrared images of lensed galaxies, by public X-ray Rosat images and by
the spatial distribution of bright galaxies. Taking advantage of the extension
and depth of our data, which sample an almost unexplored region in the depth
vs. observed area diagram, we derive the luminosity function (LF), down to the
dwarf regime (M*+5), computed in several cluster portions. The overall LF,
computed on a 2.66 Mpc2 areas (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc), has an intermediate slope
(alpha=-1.2). However, the LF parameters depend on the surveyed cluster region:
the central concentration has 2.6^{+5.1}_{-1.7} times more bright galaxies and
5.3^{+7.2}_{-2.3} times less dwarfs per typical galaxy than the outer region,
which includes galaxies at an average projected distance of ~580 kpc (errors
are quoted at the 99.9 % confidence level). The LF in the secondary AC118 clump
is intermediate between the central and outer one. In other words, the
near-infrared AC118 LF steepens going from high to low density regions. At an
average clustercentric distance of ~580 kpc, the AC118 LF is statistically
indistinguishable from the LF of field galaxies at similar redshift, thus
suggesting that the hostile cluster environment plays a minor role in shaping
the LF at large clustercentric distances, while it strongly affects the LF at
higher galaxy density.

because of strong correlation between the exciton recombination at the plane
interface and at the roughness. Expressions that relate the parameters of the
luminescence kinetics with statistical characteristics of the rough interface
are obtained. The mean height and length of roughnesses in GaAs/AlAs
superlattices are estimated from the experimental data.

carriers across the junction at a narrow energy range, which is intrinsically
linked to the localized character of the overlayer f-orbital.

The geometrical constraints on the target space of the 4d, N=2 non-linear

renormalization group flow equations in two dimensions. Our geometrical
description of the renormalization flow is manifestly covariant under general
reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants. An explicit exact solution to
the 2d renormalization flow, based on its dual holographic description in terms
of the Zamolodchikov metric, is considered in the particular case of the
four-dimensional NLSM target space described by the SU(2)-invariant (Weyl)
anti-self-dual Einstein metrics. The exact regular (Tod-Hitchin) solutions to
these metrics are governed by the Painlev'e VI equation, and describe domain

considered; we show that it can create antiferromagnetic sublattices at
macroscopic scale. We demonstrate that the result of measurement depends on the
symmetry of the ground state: for the easy-axis case the Neel state is formed,
while for the easy-plane case unusual ``fan'' sublattices appear with unbroken
rotational symmetry, and a decoherence wave is generated. For the latter case,
a macroscopically large number of measurements is needed to pin down the
orientation of the sublattices, in spite of the high degeneracy of the ground
state. We note that the type of the final state and the appearance of the
decoherence wave are governed by the degree of entanglement of spins in the
system.
