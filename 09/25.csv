from rotationally and vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen. This line
emission has now been studied with ISO and from the ground in great detail. A
remarkable discovery has been that toward the Orion outflow and other
shock-excited regions, the H_2 level populations show a very high excitation
component. We suggest that these high-excitation populations may arise from
non-thermal pumping processes, such as H_2 formation and high-velocity
ion-molecule collision in partially dissociative shocks. In PDRs such as NGC
7023 however, formation pumping is always less important than fluorescent
pumping. We furthermore present two HD emission line detections toward Orion
Peak 1. This enables the first comparison of the H_2 and the HD excitation,
which surprisingly turn out to be identical.

non-linear scales anisotropy in the power-spectrum is dominated by the galaxy
velocity dispersion; the `Finger of God' effect. On larger, linear scales
coherent peculiar velocities due to the infall of galaxies into overdense
regions are the main cause of anisotropy. According to gravitational
instability theory these distortions depend only on the density and bias
parameters via beta. Geometrical distortions also occur if the wrong cosmology
is assumed, although these would be relatively small given the low redshift of
the survey. To quantify these effects, we assume the real-space power spectrum
of the APM Galaxy Survey, and fit a simple model for the redshift-space and
geometrical distortions. Assuming a flat Omega = 1 universe, we find values for
the one-dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion of sigma_p = 410 +- 170 km/s,
and beta = 0.38 +- 0.17. An open Omega = 0.3, and a flat Omega = 0.3, Lambda =

beta = 0.45 respectively, with comparable errors. These results are consistent
with estimates using the two-point galaxy correlation function, xi(sigma,pi),
and favour either a low-density universe with Omega ~ 0.3 if galaxies trace the
underlying mass distribution, or a bias factor of b ~ 2.5 if Omega = 1.

the de-correlation times of velocity field and magnetic field are shorter than
the eddy turn-over time of the MHD turbulence. We also show that under certain
circumstances, for example if the kinetic helicity and current helicity are
comparable, $\alpha$ depends insensitively on magnetic Prandtl number, while if
either the kinetic helicity or the current helicity is dominated by the other
one, a different magnetic Prandtl number will significantly change the dynamo

galaxies extending from blue compact dwarfs, to normal and starburst galaxies,
down to elliptical and ultraluminous galaxies (ULIGs). The variation in the
relative [C II] 158 micron line strength has been attributed to low metallicity
in blue compact dwarfs, high <G_o>/n for normal galaxies and ULIGs, soft
radiation fields in ellipticals, and extinction or enhanced abundance of dust
in ionized regions in ULIGs.
  Full ISO/LWS far-infrared (43 - 197 micron) spectra of six nearby IR-bright
galaxies reveal a dramatic progression of decreasing fine-structure line
emission from ionized species to molecular (OH and H2O) absorption line
dominated. The archetypical ULIG, Arp 220, lies at the absorption line
dominated end of this sequence. For Arp 220, radiative transfer models indicate
that it is optically thick in the FIR and that the water molecules observed in
absorption are radiatively excited. If extinction plays a role in the sequence
it appears from this analysis that the affected regions are heavily obscured
even in the far-infrared, while the detected line emission is not more obscured
in ULIGs than in starbursts. Linear correlation between polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) 6.2 micron feature strength and the [C II] 158 micron line
strength in starbursts and ULIGs suggests a similar effect for these emitting
species, and that the detected PAH emission is not more obscured in ULIGs than
in lower luminosity starbursts.

late AGB stage of its progenitor and by variable, ``precessing'' collimated
bipolar outflows during the proto-PN and/or early PN phases. The data strongly
support the existence of a binary central star at center of Hu 2-1: (1) the
brightness distribution of the bipolar lobes and inner shell is
point-symmetric, and the bipolar lobes show departures from axial symmetry; (2)
the position of the central star is off-center; (3) mass ejection towards the
equatorial plane is detected; (4) ``precessing'' collimated outflows are
present. Besides all this circumstantial evidences, the analysis of the
kinematics shows that the systemic velocity of the bipolar outflows does not
coincide with the systemic velocity of the nebula. We propose that this
velocity difference is a direct evidence of orbital motion of the ejection
source in a binary system. Assuming a reasonable range of masses for the
progenitor stars, the orbital velocity of ~10 km/s corresponds to a semi-major
axis of 9-27 AU and to a period of 25-80 yr. The formation of Hu 2-1 is
analyzed within current scenarios of PN formation with binary central stars.

other method is based on simulations in the (NpT) ensemble exploiting the
relationship between strain fluctuations and elastic constants. The strengths
and weaknesses of the methods are discussed thoroughly. We show how one can
reduce statistical and systematic errors associated with so-called primitive
estimators. The methods are then applied to solid argon at atmospheric
pressures and solid helium 3 (hcp, fcc, and bcc) under varying pressures. Good
agreement with available experimental data on elastic constants is found for
helium 3. Predictions are made for the thermal expectation value of the kinetic
energy of solid helium 3.

of S^3. Although its definition is purely topological (inspired by the bridge
number of knots), p(T) reflects the geometric properties of T.
  Specifically, if T is polytopal or shellable then p(T) is `small' in the
sense that we obtain a linear upper bound for p(T) in the number n=n(T) of
tetrahedra of T.
  Conversely, if p(T) is `small' then T is `almost' polytopal, since we show
how to transform T into a polytopal triangulation by O((p(T))^2) local
subdivisions. The minimal number of local subdivisions needed to transform T
into a polytopal triangulation is at least $\frac{p(T)}{3n}-n-2$.
  Using our previous results [math.GT/0007032], we obtain a general upper bound
for p(T) exponential in n^2. We prove here by explicit constructions that there
is no general subexponential upper bound for p(T) in n. Thus, we obtain
triangulations that are `very far' from being polytopal.
  Our results yield a recognition algorithm for S^3 that is conceptually
simpler, though somewhat slower, as the famous Rubinstein-Thompson algorithm.

product of two 2-dimensional spheres when the ratio of their areas lies in the
interval (1,2]. More precisely we compute the homotopy type of this
symplectomorphism group and we also show that the group contains two finite
dimensional Lie groups generating the homotopy. A key step in this work is to
calculate the mod 2 homology of the group of symplectomorphisms. Although this
homology has a finite number of generators with respect to the Pontryagin
product, it is unexpected large containing in particular a free noncommutative
ring with 3 generators.

phase space, which relate integrable systems with a common Lagrangian
submanifold. Various parametric forms of trajectories are associated with
different integrals of motion, Lax equations, separated variables and
action-angles variables. In this review we will discuss namely these induced
transformations instead of the various parametric form of the geometric
objects.

C63 (2001) 045801","10.1103/PhysRevC.63.045801",,"nucl-th astro-ph nucl-ex physics.atom-ph",,"  Two models are presented for the description of the electron screening
effects that appear in laboratory nuclear reactions at astrophysical energies.
The two-electron screening energy of the first model agrees very well with the
recent LUNA experimental result for the break-up reaction $%
He3(He3,2p)He^{4}$, which so far defies all available theoretical models.
Moreover, multi-electron effects that enhance laboratory reactions of the CNO
cycle and other advanced nuclear burning stages, are also studied by means of
the Thomas-Fermi model, deriving analytical formulae that establish a lower and
upper limit for the associated screening energy. The results of the second
model, which show a very satisfactory compatibility with the adiabatic
approximation ones, are expected to be particularly useful in future
experiments for a more accurate determination of the CNO astrophysical factors.

a discrepancy between theory and experiment of about 0.0007a_0^3, which has
been attributed to relativistic and QED effects. In present work we analyze an
influence of the relativistic effects on the scalar dipole polarizability of an
isolated H_2^+ molecular ion. Our conclusion is that it accounts for only 1/5
of the measured discrepancy.

base of representation theorems for both compound and evolving systems, is
proved; formally it is encoded in a quantaloidal setting. Other particular
examples of quantaloids and quantaloidal morphisms appear naturally within this
setting; as in the case of causal duality, they originate from primitive
physical reasonings on the lattices of properties of physical systems.
Furthermore, an essentially dynamical operational foundation for studying
physical systems is outlined; complementary as it is to the existing static
operational foundation, it leads to the natural axiomatization of `causal
duality' in operational quantum logic.
