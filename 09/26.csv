analysis of these WFPC2 data reveals ~75 variables, but NO light curves
resulted for which a convincing interpretation as a planet could be made. The
planet frequency in 47 Tuc is at least an order of magnitude below that for the

not yet known; presumably the low metallicity and/or crowding of 47 Tuc
interfered with planet formation, with orbital evolution to close-in positions,
or with planet survival.

54 PNe have clearly identified warm dust emission features, and form a sample

galactic disk PNe. The dust emission features complement the information on the
progenitor masses brought by the gas-phase N/O ratios: PNe with unidentified
infrared emission bands have the highest N/O ratios, while PNe with the
silicate signature have either very high N enrichment or close to none, and SiC
emission features coincide with a range of moderate N-enrichments. We find a
trend for a decreasing proportion of O-rich PNe towards the third and fourth
galactic quadrants. Two independent distance scales confirmed that the
proportion of O-rich PNe decreases from 30+-9% inside the solar circle, to
14+-7% outside. PNe with warm dust are also the youngest. PNe with no warm dust
are uniformly distributed in C/O and N/O ratios, and do not appear to be
confined to C/O~1. They also have higher 6cm fluxes, as expected from more
evolved PNe. We show that the IRAS fluxes are a good representation of the
bolometric flux for warm-dust PNe. The requirement F(12um)>0.5Jy should probe a
good portion of the galactic disk, and the dominant selection effects are
rooted in the PN catalogues.

be linked to the underlying stellar population? The PNe with warm dust emission
represent a homogeneous population, which is presumably young and minimally
affected by a possible dependence of PN lifetime on progenitor mass. The sample
in paper I thus allows testing the predictions of single star evolution,
through a comparison with synthetic distributions and under the assumption that
tip-of-the-AGB and PN statistics are similar. We construct a schematic model
for AGB evolution (adapted from Groenewegen & de Jong 1993), whose
free-parameters are calibrated with the luminosity function (LF) of C stars in
the LMC, the initial-final mass relation, and the range of PN compositions. The
observed metallicity gradient and distribution of star forming regions with
galactocentric radius (Bronfman et al. 2000) allow us to synthesise the
galactic disk PN progenitor population. We find the fraction of O-rich PNe,
f(O), is a tight constraint on AGB parameters. For our best model, a minimum PN
progenitor mass Mmin=1Msun predicts that about 50% of all young PNe should be
O-rich, compared to an observed fraction of 22%; thus Mmin=1.2Msun, at a 2sigma
confidence level. By contrast, current AGB models for single stars can account
neither for the continuous range of N enrichment (Leisy & Dennefeld 1996), nor
for the observation that the majority of very C-rich PNe have Peimbert type I
(paper I). f(O) is thus an observable much easier to model. The decrease in
f(O) with galactocentric radius, as reported in paper I, is a strong property
of the synthetic distribution, independent of Mmin. This trend reflects the
sensitivity of the surface temperature of AGB stars and of the core mass at the
first thermal pulse to the galactic metallicity gradient.

(STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The slit sampled portions of
the inner circumstellar ring at the east and west ansae as well as small
sections of both the northern and southern outer rings. The temperature and
density at these locations are estimated by nebular analysis of [N II], [O
III], and [S II] emission line ratios, and with time-dependent
photoionization/recombination models. The results from these two methods are
mutually consistent. The electron density in the inner ring is ~ 4000 cm-3 for
S II, with progressively lower densities for N II and O III. The electron
temperatures determined from [N II] and [O III] line ratios are ~11,000 K and
\~22,000 K, respectively. These results are consistent with evolutionary trends
in the circumstellar gas from similar measurements at earlier epochs. We find
that emission lines from the outer rings come from gas of lower density (n_e
\la 2000 cm-3) than that which emits the same line in the inner ring. The N/O
ratio appears to be the same in all three rings. Our results also suggest that
the CNO abundances in the northern outer ring are the same as in the inner

in the southern outer ring are less certain because of poorer signal-to-noise

at p.a. 103\arcdeg that coincides with the recently discovered new regions that
are brightening (Lawrence et al. 2000). This indicates that the shock

previously-published nuclear spectra. The quasar black-hole mass estimates are
combined with reverberation-mapping measurements for a sample of Seyfert
galaxies (Wandel 1999) in order to study AGN black-hole masses over a wide
range in nuclear luminosity. It is found that black-hole mass and bulge
luminosity are well correlated and follow a relation consistent with that
expected if black-hole and bulge mass are directly proportional. Contrary to
the results of Wandel (1999) no evidence is found that Seyfert galaxies follow
a different Mblack-Mbulge relation to quasars. However, the black-hole mass
distributions of the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasar sub-samples are found to
be significantly different, with the median black-hole mass of the radio-loud
quasars a factor of three larger than their radio-quiet counterparts. Finally,
utilizing the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane to provide stellar velocity
dispersion estimates, a comparison is performed between the virial H-beta
black-hole mass estimates and those of the Mblack-sigma correlations of
Gebhardt et al. (2000a) and Merritt & Ferrarese (2000). With the disc-like
geometry of the broad-line region adopted in this paper, the virial H-beta
black-hole masses indicate that the correct normalization of the black-hole vs.
bulge mass relation is Mblack=0.0025Mbulge, while the standard assumption of
purely random broad-line velocities leads to Mblack=0.0008Mbulge. The
normalization of Mblack=0.0025Mbulge provided by the disc model is in
remarkably good agreement with that inferred for our quasar sample using the

converting pulsational energy into mass loss, we find that, even for the larger

Universe is presented. It relies on the spatially coarse-grained description of
the dynamical evolution of a many-body gravitating system. Because of the
assumed irrelevance of short-range (``collisional'') interactions, the way to
tackle the hydrodynamic equations is essentially different from the usual case.
The main assumption is that the influence of the small scales over the
large-scale evolution is weak: this idea is implemented in the form of a
large-scale expansion for the coarse-grained equations. This expansion builds a
framework in which to derive in a controlled manner the popular ``dust'' model
(as the lowest-order term) and the ``adhesion'' model (as the first-order
correction). It provides a clear physical interpretation of the assumptions
involved in these models and also the possibility to improve over them.

Consequently, rivers tend to lie in locations of high curvature and flat
slopes. Gaussian surfaces are introduced as a model of random topography. For
Gaussian surfaces the relation between convergence and slope is obtained
analytically. The convergence of flow lines correlates positively with drainage
area, so that lower slopes are associated with larger basins. As a consequence,
we explain the observed relation between the local slope of a landscape and the
area of the drainage basin geometrically. To some extent, the slope-area

because of the way rivers choose their path. Our results are supported by

electro-static potential in the region of the molecular wire. We apply the
method to a three-terminal molecular wire connected to metallic leads. The
molecular wire is a pi-conjugated carbon chain with thiol end groups,
self-assembled on the cleaved edge of a multilayer of alternating thin metal
and insulating films. The ends of the chain bond to two outer metal layers that
act as source and drain, and the chain bridges a third (inner) metal layer that
acts as a gate. We show that transistor action should occur in this device if
on the surface of the metal gate there are absorbed atoms that acquire charge
as the gate voltage is increased, thereby enhancing the interaction between the
gate and molecule and creating a strong potential barrier that hinders electron
flow along the molecular wire. We find that electronic solitons play an
important role in the response of this system to applied voltages.

is accounted for by including correlation between fermions at the ladder level.
Using a simplified one-dimensional model with on-site Coulomb interaction, we
calculate the one-particle self-energies, chemical potential, and optical
response. The results are compared to those obtained in the Born approximation,
which does not account for bound pairs. In the self-consistent ladder
approximation the self-energy and spectral function show a characteristic
correlation peak at the exciton energy for low temperature and density. In this
regime the Born approximation overestimates the chemical potential. Provided
the appropriate vertex correction in the interaction with the photon is
included, both ladder and Born approximations reproduce the excitonic and free
pair optical absorption at low density, and the disappearance of the exciton
absorption peak at larger density. However, lineshapes and energy shifts with
density of the absorption and photoluminescence peaks are drastically
different. In particular, the photoluminescence emission peak is much more
stable in the ladder approximation. At low temperature and density a sizeable
optical gain is produced in both approximations just below the excitonic peak,
however this gain shows unphysical features in the Born approximation. We
conclude that at low density and temperature it is fundamental to take into
account the existence of bound pairs in the electron-hole plasma for the
calculation of its optical and thermodynamic properties. Other approximations
that fail to do so are intrinsically unphysical in this regime, and for example
are not suitable to address the problem of excitonic lasing.

described in terms of a two-fluid model, where one fluid is the neutron
superfluid, which is believed to exist in the core and inner crust of mature
neutron stars, and the other fluid represents a conglomerate of all other
constituents (crust nuclei, protons, electrons, etc.). We obtain a system of
equations, good to second-order in the rotational velocities, that determines
the metric and the matter variables, irrespective of the equation of state for
the two fluids. In particular, allowance is made for the so-called entrainment
effect, whereby the momentum of one constituent (e.g. the neutrons) carries
along part of the mass of the other constituent. As an illustration of the
developed framework, we consider a simplified equation of state for which the
two fluids are described by different polytropes. We determine numerically the
effects of the two fluids on the rotational frame-dragging, the induced changes
in the neutron and proton densities and the inertial mass, as well as the
change in shape of the star. We further discuss issues regarding conservation

of the quark transversity distributions of the nucleon. We show that the quark
transversity distributions predicted both by the light-cone
quark-spectator-diquark model and by a pQCD inspired model can give consistent
descriptions of the available HERMES data for the analyzing powers
$A_{UL}^{\sin \phi}$ and $A_{UL}^{\sin 2 \phi}$ for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$
productions. We also show that the two models give similar predictions of
$A_{UL}^{\sin \phi}$ for $\pi^+$ production, whereas they give very different
predictions of $A_{UL}^{\sin \phi}$ for $\pi^-$ production at large $x$.
Further precision measurement of $A_{UL}^{\sin \phi}$ for $\pi^-$ production
can provide a decisive test of different models.

there exist generalized ``zero-curvature'' representation of the pertinent

being Kac-Moody group the equations of motion of the underlying gauged WZNW
geometric action are identified as additional-symmetry flows of generalized
Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies based on the loop algebra ${\hat \cG}$.
For ${\hat \cG} = {\hat {SL}}(M+R)$ the latter hiearchies are equivalent to a
class of constrained (reduced) KP hierarchies called ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$, which
contain as special cases a series of well-known integrable systems (mKdV, AKNS,
Fordy-Kulish, Yajima-Oikawa etc.). We describe in some detail the loop algebras
of additional (non-isospectral) symmetries of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$ hierarchies.
Apart from gauged WZNW models, certain higher-dimensional nonlinear systems
such as Davey-Stewartson and $N$-wave resonant systems are also identified as
additional symmetry flows of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$ hierarchies. Along the way we
exhibit explicitly the interrelation between the Sato pseudo-differential
operator formulation and the algebraic (generalized) Drinfeld-Sokolov

measurements bring a disturbance to the system being measured. We consider two
observers who initially assign identical mixed-state density operators to a
two-state quantum system. The question we address is to what extent one
observer can, by measurement, increase the purity of his density operator
without affecting the purity of the other observer's. If there were no
restrictions on the first observer's measurements, then he could carry this out
trivially by measuring the initial density operator's eigenbasis. If, however,
the allowed measurements are those of finite strength---i.e., those
measurements strictly within the interior of the convex set of all
measurements---then the issue becomes significantly more complex. We find that
for a large class of such measurements the first observer's purity increases
the most precisely when there is some loss of purity for the second observer.
More generally the tradeoff between the two purities, when it exists, forms a
monotonic relation. This tradeoff has potential application to quantum state
control and feedback.
