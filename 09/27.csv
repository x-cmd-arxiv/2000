to the total metal production rate. The Coma UV LF is dominated by star forming
galaxies, not by massive and large galaxies. The optical Coma LF is relatively
steep (alpha=-1.4) over the 11 magnitudes sampled. We found a clear steeping of
the FL going from B to R bands, indicative of the presence of a large number of
red dwarfs, as faint as three bright globular clusters. Furthermore, using
Hubble Space Telescope images, we discover that blends of globular clusters,
not resolved in individual components due to seeing, look like dwarf galaxies
when observed from the ground and are numerous and bright. The existence of
these fake extended sources increases the steepness of the LF at faint
magnitudes, if not deal on. The near-infrared LF was computed on a
near-infrared selected sample of galaxies which photometry is complete down to
the typical dwarf (M^*+5) luminosity. The Coma LF can be described by a
Schechter function with intermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at M_H~-22
mag. The shape of the Coma LF in H band is quite similar to the one found in
the B band. The similarity of the LF in the optical and H bands implies that in
the central region of Coma there is no new population of galaxies which is too
faint to be observed in the optical band (because dust enshrouded, for
instance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs.

differs significantly from the conventional polytropic equation of state: The
gas temperature profile may show a dramatic increase or decrease with outward
radius, depending sensitively on the beta parameter. A large beta value
(typically greater than 0.8) is required in order to ensure that the X-ray
temperature makes a drop at the virial radius. This indicates that either the
NFW profile is inappropriate to apply for the overall dark matter distribution
of clusters or other non-gravitational heating processes may play an important
role in the dynamical evolution of clusters.

isothermality or a significant decline with increasing radius. Nevertheless, we
find a good agreement between our derived temperature profiles and the recent
analysis of 11 clusters observed with BeppoSAX (Irwin & Bregman 2000), which

in the foils after deformation. This was interpreted as evidence for a new
dislocation-free deformation mechanism, resulting in a very high vacancy
production rate.
  In this paper we investigate this proposition using large-scale computer
simulations of bulk and thin films of copper. To favour such a dislocation-free
deformation mechanism, we have made dislocation nucleation very difficult by
not introducing any potential dislocation sources in the initial configuration.
Nevertheless, we observe the nucleation of dislocation loops, and the
deformation is carried by dislocations. The dislocations are nucleated as
single Shockley partials.
  The large stresses required before dislocations are nucleated result in a
very high dislocation density, and therefore in many inelastic interactions
between the dislocations. These interactions create vacancies, and a very large
vacancy concentration is quickly reached.

  Space-Time?","12 pages",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The Finsler-relativistic metric function $F(g;R)$ and the associated
Hamiltonian function $H(g;P)$, being considered together with explicit
Finslerian special-relativistic kinematic transformations, give rise to a
self-consistent and rigorous framework upon which corrections to
Lorentz-relativistic quantities can properly be evaluated. The concomitant
relations generalize their Lorentzian prototypes through the presence of a
single characteristic parameter, ~$g$, so that the explicated
Particle-Antiparticle Asymmetry, as well as the search for possible distinction
between the pseudo-Euclidean Light Geometry and the Finsler-relativistic
Neutrino Geometry, can well be traced in terms of this parameter. At any fixed
rest-mass value $m$ and $g\ne0$, the dependences of energy on three-dimensional
momentum prove to be of different forms, as given by the respective functions
$E^{(+)}(g;m;|{\bf P}|)$ and $E^{(-)}(g;m;|{\bf P}|)$, for particles and
antiparticles. This splitting of the mass-shell, as well as various entailed
Finslerian approximations with respect to $g$, can naturally be proposed for
experimental study in order to obtain estimations on $g$. Since neutrinos and
antineutrinos are uncomposed neat particles, measuring the difference between
their velocities seems to be the best way for testing implied Finslerian
corrections to conventional Lorentzian quantities. Accelerators which can
produce neutrinos and antineutrinos are ideal instruments to gain this aim. The
known measurements led to the conclusion that the difference $<0.7\cdot
10^{-4}~(95%~CL)$, while announced future long baseline neutrino experiments
probably raise the sensitivity to approach the high level of $\sim 10^{-9}$.

noncovariant description of spin and on the usual, ``naive'' definition of the
coordinate of a relativistic particle. A simple description of the
gravitational interaction of first order in spin, is pointed out for a
relativistic particle. The approach developed allows one to consider effects of
higher order in spin. Explicit expression for the second-order Hamiltonian is
presented. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment, which is a special spin effect
in general relativity.

variety of natural phenomena including climate, earthquakes and turbulence, as
well as in man-made environments like financial markets. Statistical analysis
and predictions in such systems are complicated by the fact that on the one
hand extreme events may appear as ""outliers"" whose statistical properties do
not seem to conform with the bulk of the data, and on the other hands they
dominate the (fat) tails of probability distributions and the scaling of high
moments, leading to ""abnormal"" or ""multi""-scaling. We employ a shell model of
turbulence to show that it is very useful to examine in detail the dynamics of
onset and demise of extreme events. Doing so may reveal dynamical scaling
properties of the extreme events that are characteristic to them, and not
shared by the bulk of the fluctuations. As the extreme events dominate the
tails of the distribution functions, knowledge of their dynamical scaling
properties can be turned into a prediction of the functional form of the tails.
We show that from the analysis of relatively short time horizons (in which the
extreme events appear as outliers) we can predict the tails of the probability
distribution functions, in agreement with data collected in very much longer
time horizons. The conclusion is that events that may appear unpredictable on
relatively short time horizons are actually a consistent part of a multiscaling
statistics on longer time horizons.

the form $\sigma=\sigma(R, \psi)$ ($R$ is the distance from the axis of
symmetry) several classes of analytic equilibria with incompressible flows can
be constructed having qualitatively plausible $\sigma$ profiles, i.e. profiles
with $\sigma$ taking a maximum value close to the magnetic axis and a minimum
value on the plasma surface. For $\sigma=\sigma(\psi)$ consideration of the
relation $\Delta^\star\psi = V_c \sigma(\psi)$ in the vicinity of the magnetic
axis leads therein to a proof of the non-existence of either compressible or
incompressible equilibria. This result can be extended to the more general case
of non-parallel flows lying within the magnetic surfaces.

  to the memory of Professor Efim Fradkin, Moscow, 5 - 10 May 2000, to appear
  in the Conference Proceedings",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  A new variational basis with well-behaved local approximation properties and
multiple output is proposed for Coulomb systems. The trial function has proper
behaviour at all Coulomb centres. Nonlinear asymptotic parameters are
introduced softly: they do not destroy the self-optimized local behaviour of
the wave function at vanishing interparticle distances. The diagonalization of
the Hamiltonian on a finite Hilbert subspace gives a number of meaningful
eigenvalues. Thus together with the ground state some excited states are also
reliably approximated. For three-body systems all matrix elements are
analytically obtainable up to rational functions of asymptotic parameters. The
feasibility of the new basis usage has been proved by a pilot computer algebra
calculation. The negative sign of an electron pair local energy at their
Coulomb centre has been revealed.

best an approximation, and this has been criticised by several scholars. We
investigate, what exactly this approximation entails.

gate. It is well known from quantum nondemolition techniques that, as two
photon field modes pass through a Kerr medium, the phase of each mode will be
shifted, and the size of the phase shift will depend on the number of photons
in both modes. We discuss the Hamiltonian responsible for this effect and show
how this can produce an effective photon-photon interaction which corresponds
to the quantum phase gate operating on two qubits each of which is represented
by the elliptical polarization of one photon field. We discuss decoherence and
losses and suggest some methods for dealing with them.
