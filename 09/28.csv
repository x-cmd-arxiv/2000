first report by Koyama et al. (1996, AAA 65.155.208). The observed spectrum
contains prominent emission lines from helium-like and hydrogen-like ions of
various elements, and is essentially the same all over the region. If the
observed spectrum is thermal emission from hot plasmas, it requires
multi-temperature plasma components, each at a different degree of ionization
and with a different amount of absorption. The absence of adiabatic cooling and
of systematic changes in the degree of ionization over the region is against
the Galactic center origin of hot plasmas. A significant broadening of the
helium-like and hydrogen-like iron K-lines is confirmed. The line width
corresponds to a rms velocity of $\sim3300$ km~s$^{-1}$, which far exceeds the
sound velocity in a plasma of $kT\sim14$ keV measured with the Ginga satellite.
These facts cast doubt on a thermal origin of the observed X-ray emission.

profile of the common halo and of the galaxy distribution. We select two kinds
of density distributions, a singular profile (modeled by a Hernquist
distribution) and a profile with a flat core (modeled by a Plummer sphere). In
all cases we witness the formation of a central massive object due to mergings
of individual galaxies and to accretion of stripped material, but both its
formation history and its properties depend heavily on the initial
distribution. In Hernquist models the formation is due to a ``burst'' of
mergings in the inner parts, due to the large initial concentration of galaxies
in the center. The merging rate is much slower in the initial phases of the
evolution of a Plummer distribution, where the contribution of accretion to the
formation of the central object is much more important. The central objects
formed within Plummer distributions have projected density profiles which are
not in agreement with the radial profiles of observed brightest cluster
members, unless the percentage of mass in the common halo is small. On the
contrary the central object formed in initially cusped models has projected
radial profiles in very good agreement with those of brightest cluster members,
sometimes also showing luminosity excess over the $r^{1/4}$ law in the outer

globular clusters, which indicates that globulars have a high probability of
containing X-ray binaries compared to the normal stellar population. The X-ray
luminosities (0.3-10 keV) of the resolved LMXBs range from ~5e37 to ~2.5e39

presence of this large population of NS and massive BH stellar remnants in this

mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) has attracted attention to highly relativistic
periodic motion near accreting neutron stars. Most models proposed so far
involve (almost) inertial motion in the vicinity of the stars' innermost stable
circular orbits. In the present paper we study general-relativistic circular
and eccentric orbits around spinning neutron stars assuming the orbits are
slightly tilted with respect to the stars' equatorial planes. We develop
analytical and numerical techniques for integrating bound timelike geodesics in
fully relativistic neutron star spacetimes obtained by modern numerical codes.
We use equations of state of neutron star matter that span a broad range of
stiffness, while the explored range of masses M > 1.7 M(solar) and spin
frequencies nu_s < 600 Hz is motivated by the observations of LMXBs. We
investigate the general-relativistic effects of periastron advance and nodal
precession in the strong gravitational fields of rotating neutron stars and
compare quantitatively the associated orbital frequencies with the more readily
obtainable frequencies of orbits around Kerr black holes on the one hand, and
low-order post-Newtonian (PN) expansions, on the other. While Kerr results
approximate the periastron advance frequency much better than the PN
expressions, the retrograde torque caused by the high quadrupole moments of the
rotating stars clearly favours the PN approximation in the case of nodal
precession. The methods developed in the present paper are used in the
companion paper to test recent hypotheses regarding the origin of
quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting neutron star sources.

affects not only neutrinos' behavior but also the inner radius of the accretion
disk. When the deposition energy is mainly contributed by the neutrinos coming
from the central part, the redshift effect becomes dominant as $a$ becomes
large and the energy deposition rate is reduced compared with that neglecting
the relativistic effects. On the other hand, for small $a$ the bending effect
gets dominant and makes energy increase by factor 2 compared with that
neglecting the relativistic effects. For the disk with temperature gradient,
the energy deposition rate for a small inner radius of the accretion disk is
smaller than that estimated by neglecting the relativistic effects. The

background (CIRB) all suggest that galaxies have experienced a strong evolution
sometime in their lifetime. We statistically estimate the galaxy evolution
history from these data. We find that an order of magnitude increase of the
far-infrared (FIR) luminosity at redshift z = 0.5 - 1.0 is necessary to
reproduce the very high CIRB intensity at 140 um reported by Hauser et al.
(1998). z \sim 0.75 and decreases to, even at most, a factor of 10 toward z
\sim 5, though many variants are allowed within these constraints. This
evolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy number counts
obtained by IRAS, ISO and, roughly, SCUBA. The rapid evolution of the comoving
IR luminosity density required from the CIRB well reproduces the very steep
slope of galaxy number counts obtained by ISO. We also estimate the cosmic star
formation history (SFH) from the obtained FIR luminosity density, considering
the effect of the metal enrichment in galaxies. The derived SFH increases
steeply with redshift in 0 < z < 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines at z >
0.75. This is consistent with the SFH estimated from the reported ultraviolet
luminosity density. In addition, we present the performance of the Japanese
ASTRO-F FIR galaxy survey. We show the expected number counts in the survey. We

obeys Gaussian statistics or not. On the one hand, it is of paramount
importance in the context of CMB anisotropy studies, since deviations from a
Gaussian distribution could indicate the presence of uncorrected measurement
systematics, of remaining fluctuations contributed by foregrounds, of
deviations from the simplest models of inflation or of topological defects. On
the other hand, looking for a non-Gaussian signal is a very ill-defined task
and performances of various assessment methods may differ widely when applied
in different contexts.
  In previous studies, we introduced a sensitive wavelet-based method which we
apply here to the COBE/DMR data set, already extensively studied, using
different approaches. This provides an objective way to compare methods. It
turns out that our multi-scale wavelet decomposition is a sensitive method. Yet
we show that the results are rather sensitive to the choice of both the

non-Gaussian signature is ``marginal'' with a probability of at most 99%.

missing word given its context. We present an approach to word prediction that
is based on learning a representation for each word as a function of words and
linguistics predicates in its context. This approach raises a few new questions
that we address. First, in order to learn good word representations it is
necessary to use an expressive representation of the context. We present a way
that uses external knowledge to generate expressive context representations,
along with a learning method capable of handling the large number of features
generated this way that can, potentially, contribute to each prediction.
Second, since the number of words ``competing'' for each prediction is large,
there is a need to ``focus the attention'' on a smaller subset of these. We
exhibit the contribution of a ``focus of attention'' mechanism to the
performance of the word predictor. Finally, we describe a large scale
experimental study in which the approach presented is shown to yield
significant improvements in word prediction tasks.

approximately satisfy detailed balance at finite temperatures and finite baryon
densities of the hadronic scale (80 MeV < T < 170 MeV and 0.157 fm^-3 < n_B <
0.315 fm^-3). Molecular-dynamical simulations were performed for a system of
hadrons in a box with periodic boundary conditions. Starting from an initial
state composed of only nucleons with a uniform phase-space distribution, the
evolution takes place through interactions such as collisions, productions and
absorptions. The system approaches a stationary state of baryons, mesons and
their resonances, which is characterized by the value of the exponent in the
energy distribution common to the different particles, i.e., the temperature.
After the equilibration, thermodynamic quantities, such as the energy density,
particle density, entropy and pressure are calculated. Above T - m_pi, the
obtained equation of state exhibits a significant deviation from the naive
mixed free gas model. Large values of the entropy per baryon are also notable.
In our system, the excitation of heavy baryon resonances and meson production
are enhanced simultaneously, and the increase of the temperature becomes
moderate, but a Hagedorn-type artificial temperature saturation does not occur.
The pressure exhibits a linear dependence on the energy density.

While this factorization appears in the non-relativistic plane wave impulse
approximation, it is broken in a more realistic approach. The main source of
factorization breaking are final state interactions. In this paper, sources of
factorization breaking are identified and their numerical relevance is examined
in the reaction ^2H(e,e'p) for various kinematic settings in the GeV regime.

  the nature of fundamental particles",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This report provides an alternative to the Standard Model of particle
physics. The model described here is based on results from Quantum Field
Mechanics, according to which all fundamental particles and interactions
originate from the interaction of two pre-space/pre-time protofields. In
contrast with the Standard Model, (virtual) interaction-particles are absent in
the description of any of the four fundamental interactions. Electrons perform
a single quantum beat process while mesons and baryons have, respectively, two
and three bound quantum beat processes. Quantum Field Mechanics suggests that
the charge of an electron and positron can be identified with the two possible
phases of a quantum beat process as observed in the electromagnetic protofield.
This report assumes that short-range binding interaction between quantum beat
processes has a masking effect on the externally observable charge of hadrons.
Using this assumption, the internal structure of particles is derived from
their known particle charges and relative masses. The particle structures are
used to obtain the so-called charge-quantum phase law. The fractional charge of
quantum beat processes inside a particle is deduced by rewriting the
charge-quantum phase law in terms of a linear combination of charge
contributions of individual constituent quantum beat processes. Strangeness and
isospin are mathematically defined in terms of the quantum beat phases of sets
of particles of the same type. Application of conservation laws to particle
processes leads to relations between quantum phase, strangeness and isospin.

  Conference","eConf C00082:TH205,2000",,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  As compared to electron storage rings, one advantage of recirculating linear
accelerators is that the beam properties at target are no longer dominated by
the equilibrium between quantum radiative diffusion and radiation damping
because new beam is continually injected into the accelerator. This allows the
energy spread from a CEBAF-type machine to be relatively small; the measured
energy spread from CEBAF at 4 GeV is less than 100 parts per million
accumulated over times of order several days. In this paper, the various
subsystems contributing to the energy spread of a CEBAF-type accelerator are
reviewed, as well as the machine diagnostics and controls that are used in
CEBAF to ensure that a small energy spread is provided during routine running.
Examples of relevant developments are (1) stable short bunches emerging from
the injector, (2) precision timing and phasing of the linacs with respect to
the centroid of the beam bunches on all passes, (3) implementing 2 kHz sampling
rate feedback systems for final energy stabilization, and (4) continuous beam
energy spread monitoring with optical transition radiation devices. We present
measurement results showing that small energy spreads are achieved over

actively developed by one of the authors incorporates 3 basic concepts. They
are the old idea of Chew about bootstrapping, Nottale's scale relativity, and
enlargement of the conventional time-space by inclusion of noncommutative
Clifford manifolds where all p-branes are treated on equal footing. The latter
allows one to write a master action functional. The resulting functional
equation is simplified and applied to the p-loop oscillator. Its solution
represents a generalization of the conventional quantum point oscillator. In
addition, it exhibits some novel features: an emergence of two explicit scales
delineating the asymptotic regimes (Planck scale region and a smooth region of
a quantum point oscillator). In the most interesting Planck scale regime, the
solution recovers in an elementary fashion some basic relations of string
theory (including string tension quantization and string uncertainty relation).
It is shown that the degeneracy of the $first$ collective excited state of the
p-loop oscillator yields not only the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking
area-entropy linear relation but also the logarithmic corrections therein. In
addition we obtain for any number of dimensions the Hawking temperature, the
Schwarschild radius, and the inequalities governing the area of a black hole
formed in a fusion of two black holes. One of the interesting results is a
demonstration that the evaporation of a black hole is limited by the upper
bound on its temperature, the Planck temperature.

determination of specific classical paths inhabiting a complex phase-space
through a Hamiltonian flux. Such trajectories are constrained to special
boundary conditions which render their determination difficult by common
methods. In this paper we present a new method based on Runge-Kutta integrator
for a quick, easy and accurate determination of these trajectories. Using
nonlinear one dimensional systems we show that the semiclassical formula is
highly accurate as compared to its exact counterpart . Further we clarify how
the phase of the semiclassical approximation is correctly retrieved under time
evolution.

position and momentum exhibit a variety of nonclassical features. First,
measurement of one particle projects the other particle into the state that is
the complex conjugate of the state of the first particle, i.e., measurement of
one particle projects the other particle into the time-reversed state. Second,
continuous-variable entanglement can be used to implement a quantum ""magic
bullet"": when one particle manages to pass through a scattering potential, then
no matter how low the probability of this event, the second particle will also
pass through a related scattering potential with probability one. This
phenomenon is investigated in terms of the original EPR state, and experimental
realizations are suggested in terms of entangled photon states.

\phi of the phase difference between two arms of an interferometer. For an

(1995)], it yields a variance (\Delta \phi)^2 \simeq \pi^2/N^2, compared to
O(N^{-1}) or O(N^{-1/2}) for states considered by previous authors. Such a
measurement cannot be realized by counting photons in the interferometer
outputs. However, we introduce an adaptive measurement scheme that can be thus
realized, and show that it yields a variance in \phi very close to that from an
optimal measurement.

Wigner functions. Separability and the positivity of the partial transpose are
characterized in terms of the covariance matrix of the state, and it is shown
that for systems composed of a single oscillator for Alice and an arbitrary
number for Bob, positivity of the partial transpose implies separability.
However, this implications fails with two oscillators on each side, as we show
by a five parameter family of explicit counterexamples.
