  and paper at http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~percy/cf.ps",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We report the results of recent numerical simulations of the head-on merger
of a cooling flow cluster with an infalling subcluster of galaxies. These
simulations examined the effects of different types of cluster mergers (with
16:1 and 4:1 mass ratios) on the evolution of cluster cooling flows (mass
accretion rates of 100 and 400 M/year. The 2-dimensional simulations were
performed with a Hydro/N-body code on a uniform grid with a resolution of 20
kpc.
  We find that the ram-pressure of the infalling gas is crucial in determining
the fate of the cooling flow as disruption occurs when a substantial amount of
subcluster gas reaches the primary's core. In such cases, the subcluster gas
can increase the central cooling time by displacing the high-density cooling
gas and by heating it via shocks and turbulent gas motions. Moreover, the fate
of a merging cooling flow is also dependent on its initial cooling time. In
cases where the initial cooling time is very small then, even if the flow is
disrupted, the central cooling time will remain less than a Hubble time and the
flow will likely re-establish itself. This has an important observational
consequence because such clusters will be classified as cooling flows even
though they have experienced a significant merger. In addition, there is a time
delay (1-2 Gyrs) between core-crossing and the point at which the central
cooling time of a disrupted flow becomes of order a Hubble time (abridged).

less than used in some earlier studies. An overdensity of two is not enough to
bridge the gap between the predicted number of events above $10^{20}$ eV and
the measured flux at these highest energies. This conclusion is particularly
strong for soft injection spectra ($\propto E^{-3}$) where the observed number
of events is 6 $\sigma$ higher than the expected one. However, if the injection
spectrum is hard ($\propto E^{-2}$), the small local overdensity helps bring
the present data within 2$\sigma$ of the low number of events predicted above
$10^{20}$ eV. In this case, the Greisen-Zatzepin-Kuzmin cutoff is not a {\it

unambiguous separation of a signal due to Galactic halo WIMPs from other

calculation of the expected angular distribution of events in terrestrial
detectors with angular sensitivity for any incident distribution of Galactic
halo dark matter. This can be used as an input when studying the sensitivity of
specific detectors to halo WIMPs. We utilize this formalism to examine the
expected signature for WIMP dark matter using a variety of existing analytic
halo models in order to explore how uncertainty in the Galactic halo
distribution impact on the the event rates that may be required to separate a
possible WIMP signal from other terrestrial backgrounds. We find that as few as
30 events might be required to disentangle the signal from backgrounds if the
WIMP distribution resembles an isothermal sphere distribution. On the other
hand, for certain halo distributions, even detectors with fine scale resolution
may require in excess of a 100-400 events to distinguish a WIMP signal from
backgrounds using angular sensitivity. We also note that for finite thresholds
the different energy dependence of spin-dependent scattering cross sections may
require a greater number of events to discern a WIMP signal than for spin
independent interactions. Finally, we briefly describe ongoing studies aimed at
developing strategies to better exploit angular signatures, and the use of
N-body simulations to better model the expected halo distribution in predicting
the expected signature for direct WIMP detectors.

now discovered superluminal motion in the Seyfert I galaxy III Zw 2, classified

Spectral and spatial evolution are closely linked. Before and after this rapid
expansion we have seen a period of virtually no expansion with an expansion
speed less than 0.04 c. However, at 15 GHz the picture is completely different.
III Zw 2 shows slow expansion ($\sim 0.6 c$) during the time of no expansion at
43 GHz and no expansion during the rapid expansion at 43 GHz. The difference
between the two frequencies is qualitatively explained by optical-depth effects
in an 'inflating- balloon model', describing the evolution of radio lobes on an
ultra-compact scale. The stop-and-go behavior could be explained by a jet
interacting with a molecular cloud or the molecular torus. Since III Zw 2 is
also part of a sample of so- called radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ), it
confirms earlier predictions of superluminal motion for this source, based on
the argument that RIQs could be relativistically boosted jets in radio-weak
quasars and Seyfert galaxies.

for 150 Myr despite additional mass loss from the large number of massive

formation is obtained under such realistic conditions. The cluster contains
about 1/3 of the initial 10^4 stars, and resembles the Pleiades Cluster to a
remarkable degree, implying that an ONC-like cluster may have been a precursor
of the Pleiades. This scenario predicts the present expansion velocity of the

  Towards a physical understanding of their photometric properties","Revised version (considering non constant M/L), accepted by A&A on
  10/03/01",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20011370",,"astro-ph",,"  In the present paper, we show that elliptical galaxies (Es) obey a scaling
relation between potential energy and mass. Since they are relaxed systems in a
post violent-relaxation stage, they are quasi-equilibrium gravitational systems
and therefore they also have a quasi-constant specific entropy.
  Assuming that light traces mass, these two laws imply that in the space
defined by the three S\'ersic law parameters (intensity Sigma_0, scale a and
shape nu), elliptical galaxies are distributed on two intersecting 2-manifolds:
the Entropic Surface and the Energy-Mass Surface.
  Using a sample of 132 galaxies belonging to three nearby clusters, we have
verified that ellipticals indeed follow these laws. This also implies that they
are distributed along the intersection line (the Energy-Entropy line), thus
they constitute a one-parameter family.
  These two physical laws (separately or combined), allow to find the
theoretical origin of several observed photometrical relations, such as the
correlation between absolute magnitude and effective surface brightness, and
the fact that ellipticals are located on a surface in the [log R_eff, -2.5 log
Sigma_0, log nu] space. The fact that elliptical galaxies are a one-parameter
family has important implications for cosmology and galaxy formation and
evolution models. Moreover, the Energy-Entropy line could be used as a distance
indicator.

the pressure exerted on the progenitor cloud by the surrounding protogalactic

there is no significant (if any) metallicity gradient in the whole halo, we
also present a review in favour of a galactic halo partly build via accretions
and mergers of satellite systems. Some of them bear their own globular clusters
and therefore ``contaminate'' the system of globular clusters formed ``in

neutrinos, 10% baryons and 82% cold dark matter (CDM). It is shown that the LSS
observations together with the Boomerang (+MAXIMA-1) data on the first acoustic
peak rule out zero-$\Lambda$ models at more than $2\sigma$ confidence level.

  pages, including 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Galactic distribution of the high-latitude molecular clouds is
considered. It is suggested that the majority of these clouds are clustered in
two large shells around the two closest OB associations, Per OB3/Cas-Tau and
Sco OB2. The most prominent shell of high-latitude clouds is centred around the
Per OB3/ Cas-Tau association which is also at the centre of the Gould's Belt.
However, the Per OB3/Cas-Tau group of high-latitude clouds appears as an
elliptical shell at nearly right angles to the plane of the Gould's Belt. Its
kinematic age (~10 Myr) is much smaller than the expansion age (~35 Myr) of the
ring of intertellar matter associated with the Gould's Belt. It is suggested
that while, as is generally understood, the larger expanding ring of gas
associated with the Gould's Belt was created by stellar winds and supernova
explosions of the more massive OB stars of the Per OB3/Cas-Tau association ~35
Myr ago, the Per OB3 shell of high-latitude clouds was formed from the
back-falling gas as it was swept up by a more recent supernova explosion of an
early B type star in Per OB3 ~10 Myr ago. More distant OB associations also
produce similar shells of clouds at large heights from the Galactic plane
having relatively smaller angular sizes due to their greater distances. These
can be seen as higher latitude extensions of cloud complexes at lower Galactic
latitudes as, for example, in the case of Vela OB2.

dominated by a normal (proton-electron) plasma or a pair (electron-positron)
plasma. We first present a new method to compute the kinetic luminosity of a
conical jet by using the core size observed at a single very long baseline
interferometry frequency. The deduced kinetic luminosity gives electron
densities of individual radio-emitting components as a function of the
composition. We next constrain the electron density independently by using the
theory of synchrotron self-absorption. Comparing the two densities, we can
discriminate the composition. We then apply this procedure to the five
components in the 3C 345 jet and find that they are pair-plasma dominated at 14
epochs out of the total 19 epochs at which the turnover frequencies are
reported, provided that the bulk Lorentz factor is less than 15 throughout the
jet. We also investigate the composition of the 3C 279 jet and demonstrate that
its two components are likely pair-plasma dominated at all the four epochs,
provided that their Doppler factors are less than 10, which are consistent with
observations. The conclusions do not depend on the lower cutoff energy of
radiating particles.

determination of their brightness. This is not constant, but it can be
calibrated using an observed relation between the brightness and the properties
of the optical light curve (decline rate, width, shape), which indicates that
brighter SNe have broader, slower light curves. However, the physical basis for
this relation is not yet fully understood. Among possible causes are different
masses of the progenitor white dwarfs or different opacities in
Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We parametrise the Chandrasekhar-mass models
presented by Iwamoto et al (1999), which synthesize different amounts of Ni,
and compute bolometric light curves and spectra at various epochs. Since
opacity in SNe Ia is due mostly to spectral lines, it should depend on the mass
of Fe-peak elements synthesized in the explosion, and on the temperature in the
ejecta. Bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions for the
optical opacity reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate.
Furthermore, when spectra are calculated, the change in colour between maximum
and two weeks later allows the observed relation between M_B(Max) and
Dm_{15}(B) to be reproduced quite nicely. Spectra computed at various epochs
compare well with corresponding spectra of spectroscopically normal SNeIa
selected to cover a similar range of Dm_{15}(B) values.

with temperatures of about 40K and 15-21K are necessary to fit the SEDs of the

order to recognize trends. Comparisons with radio and optical tracers show that
- statistically - the cold knots can be identified well with CO and HI radio
sources and thus might represent mainly molecular cloud complexes. The warm
knots coincide with known HII regions and supernova remnants. The medium knots
might contain a balanced mixture of molecular clouds and HII regions. The cold
knots have a considerable luminosity and their discovery raises the question of
hidden star formation. Though the optically dark dust lanes in M31 generally
match the FIR ring, surprisingly we do not find a convincing coincidence of our
knots with individual dark clouds which might therefore show mainly foreground
dust features. The ratio of FIR luminosity to dust mass, L/M, is used to
measure the energy content of the dust. The knots have a clear L/M excess over
the rest of M31, providing evidence that they are powered by star formation in
addition to the interstellar radiation field. The L/M ratio of the warm knots
is comparable to that of Galactic HII regions like M42 or NGC2024, while that
of the cold knots still reaches values like in the average Orion complex. Thus
both the warm and the cold knots are interpreted as containing large cloud

arise from the rush for seats or seemingly without causes. Tragic examples
within recent months include the panics in Harare, Zimbabwe, and at the

alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing

are rare. Here we show that simulations based on a model of pedestrian

theory, superconducting phase coherence manifests itself in phase insensitive
measurements, when there is a smooth evolution of the excitation gap \Delta
from above to below Tc. In this context, we address the underdoped cuprates.
Our premise is that just as Fermi liquid theory is failing above Tc, BCS theory
is failing below. The order parameter \Delta_{sc} is different from the
excitation gap \Delta. Equivalently there is a (pseudo)gap in the excitation
spectrum above Tc which is also present in the underlying normal state of the
superconducting phase, and can be directly inferred from specific heat and
vortex core experiments. At the same time many features of BCS theory, e.g.,
fermionic quasiparticles below Tc, are clearly present. These observations can
be reconciled by a natural extension of BCS theory, which includes finite
center-of-mass momentum pair excitations, in addition to the usual fermionic
quasiparticles. Applying this theory we find that the Bose condensation of
Cooper pairs, which is reflected in \Delta_{sc}, leads to sharp peaks in the
spectral function once $T \le T_c$. These are manifested in ARPES spectra as
well as in specific heat jumps, which become more like the behavior in a
\lambda transition as the pseudogap develops. We end with a discussion of
tunneling experiments and condensation energy issues. Comparison between
theoretical and experimental plots of C_v, and of tunneling and vortex core
spectroscopy measurements is good.

process can coherently tunnel from the superconductor via different dots into
different leads. The spin-singlet coming from the Cooper pair remains preserved
in this process, and the setup provides a source of mobile and nonlocal
spin-entangled electrons. The transport current is calculated and shown to be
dominated by a two-particle Breit-Wigner resonance which allows the injection
of two spin-entangled electrons into different leads at exactly the same
orbital energy, which is a crucial requirement for the detection of spin
entanglement via noise measurements. The coherent tunneling of both electrons
into the same lead is suppressed by the on-site Coulomb repulsion and/or the
superconducting gap, while the tunneling into different leads is suppressed
through the initial separation of the tunneling electrons. In the regime of
interest the particle-hole excitations of the leads are shown to be negligible.

of residual strain, and strain relaxation, which manifests itself at the
Si/SiO$_{2}$ interfaces in commercial silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. SOI
material is made of a single-crystal silicon overlayer (SOL) on top of an
insulator (buried SiO$_{2}$ layer) sitting on a handle silicon wafer. Infrared
reflectivity spectra show that the buried SiO$_{2}$ layer relaxes continuously
when thinning the SOL. At the same time the SOL surface roughness and the
linewidth of optical phonons in Si near the Si/SiO$_2$ interface (probed by
micro-Raman specroscopy) increase. In the as-delivered wafers, this comes from
a slight expansion of Si on both sides of the buried SiO$_{2}$ layer which,
conversely, is compressed. Thinning the SOL modifies these initial equilibrium
conditions. To get quantitative results, we have modeled all our Raman spectra
using a theory of inhomogeneous shift and broadening for optical phonons, which
takes into account the phonon interaction with the static strain fluctuations.
  From the variation of linewidth versus interface distance, we have found that
the mean squared strain continues to relax in the bulk of the wafer through a
depth on the order of several $\mu m$. We also show that the SOL surface
roughness is related to strain fluctuations near the Si/SiO$_2$ interfaces.

$S/E$ by the $\zeta$-function, $(24\zeta (4))^{1/4}$, we compute $\zeta (4)$

violation of the bound. We interpret our results as imposing certain

hierarchies of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In most cases it is
assumed that the $U(1)_H$ symmetry is anomalous. However, non-anomalous models
are also viable and yield an interesting phenomenology. Cancellation of the
gauge anomalies implies the following results: unification of leptons and
down-type quarks Yukawa couplings is allowed at most for two generations. The
$\mu$ term is necessarily somewhat below the supersymmetry breaking scale. The
superpotential has accidental $B$ and $L$ symmetries, and R-parity is
automatically conserved in the supersymmetric limit. Anomaly canncellation also
implies that the determinant of the quark mass matrix must vanish, wich is
possible only if $m_{up}=0$. This solves the strong CP problem and provides an
unambiguous low energy test of the model.

through the non-diagonal coupling of neutrino flavor eigenstates with the

probability is different from that of the usual mass-mixing neutrino
oscillations. In this work we explore, in detail, the viability of the VEP
hypothesis as a solution to the solar neutrino problem in a two generation
scenario with both the active and sterile neutrino alternatives, choosing these
states to be massless. To obtain the best-fit values of the oscillation
parameters we perform a chi square analysis for the total rates of solar
neutrinos seen at the Chlorine (Homestake), Gallium (Gallex and SAGE),
Kamiokande, and SuperKamiokande (SK) experiments. We find that the goodness of
these fits is never satisfactory. It markedly improves, especially for VEP
transformation to sterile neutrinos, if the Chlorine result is excluded from
the analysis. The 1117-day SK data for recoil electron spectrum are also
examined for signals of VEP oscillations. For these fits, we consider
variations of the Standard Solar Model by allowing the absolute normalizations
of the 8B and hep neutrinos to vary. Here the fits are quite good but the best
fit values of the parameters are rather different from those from the total
rates fits. A combined fit to the total rates and recoil electron spectrum data
is also performed. We present the 90% confidence limit contours for all the
three analyses mentioned above. The best-fit parameters obtained from the
recoil electron spectrum and the combined analysis of rate and spectrum are

  Paris, July, 2000",,,,"math.LO",,"  In this paper, following an idea of Christophe Chalons, I propose a new kind
of forcing axiom, the Maximality Principle, which asserts that any sentence phi
holding in some forcing extension V^P and all subsequent extensions V^P*Q holds
already in V. It follows, in fact, that such sentences must also hold in all
forcing extensions of V. In modal terms, therefore, the Maximality Principle is
expressed by the scheme (diamond box phi) implies (box phi), and is equivalent
to the modal theory S5. In this article, I prove that the Maximality Principle
is relatively consistent with ZFC. A boldface version of the Maximality
Principle, obtained by allowing real parameters to appear in phi, is
equiconsistent with the scheme asserting that V_delta is an elementary
substructure of V for an inaccessible cardinal delta, which in turn is
equiconsistent with the scheme asserting that ORD is Mahlo. The strongest
principle along these lines is the Necessary Maximality Principle, which
asserts that the boldface MP holds in V and all forcing extensions. From this,
it follows that 0# exists, that x# exists for every set x, that projective
truth is invariant by forcing, that Woodin cardinals are consistent and much
more. Many open questions remain.

obtain samples efficiently. Often, Markov chains are employed to obtain
approximately random samples from these distributions. The primary drawback to
traditional Markov chain methods is that the mixing time of the chain is
usually unknown, which makes it impossible to determine how close the output
samples are to having the target distribution. Here we present a new protocol,
the randomness recycler (RR), that overcomes this difficulty. Unlike classical
Markov chain approaches, an RR-based algorithm creates samples drawn exactly
from the desired distribution. Other perfect sampling methods such as coupling
from the past use existing Markov chains, but RR does not use the traditional
Markov chain at all. While by no means universally useful, RR does apply to a
wide variety of problems. In restricted instances of certain problems, it gives
the first expected linear time algorithms for generating samples. Here we apply
RR to self-organizing lists, the Ising model, random independent sets, random
colorings, and the random cluster model.

systematic charge nonuniformities are not equilibria of the focusing channel
and launch a broad spectrum of collective modes. These modes can phase-mix and
have nonlinear wave-wave interactions which, at high space-charge intensities,
results in a relaxation to a more thermal-like distribution characterized by a
uniform density profile. This thermalization can transfer self-field energy
from the initial space-charge nonuniformity to the local particle temperature,
thereby increasing beam phase space area (emittance growth). In this paper, we
employ a simple kinetic model of a continuous focusing channel and build on
previous work that applied system energy and charge conservation quantify
emittance growth associated with the collective thermalization of an initial
azimuthally symmetric, rms matched beam with a radial density profile that is
hollowed or peaked. This emittance growth is shown to be surprisingly modest

The size of the cores around the vortices is well approximated by the minimum

the origin of stickiness which we link to the phenomenon of vortex pairing and
jumps of tracers between cores. Motion within the core is considered and
fluctuations are shown to scale with tracer-vortex distance $r$ as $r^{6}$. No
outward or inward diffusion of tracers are observed. This investigation allows
the separation of the accessible phase space in four distinct regions, each
with its own specific properties: the region within the cores, the reunion of
the periphery of all cores, the region where vortex motion is restricted and
finally the far-field region. We speculate that the stickiness to the cores
