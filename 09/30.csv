to determine the size of their broad emission line region (BLR) is reviewed. We
find both the continuum and the emission line fluxes of all quasars to vary
during this period. Seventeen objects has adequate sampling for reverberation
mapping and in all of them we find the Balmer line variations to lag those of
the continuum by ~100 days. This study increases the available luminosity range
for studying the size-mass-luminosity relations in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) by two orders of magnitude and doubles the number of objects suitable
for such studies. Combining our results with data available for Seyfert 1
galaxies, we find the BLR size to scale with the rest-frame 5100 A luminosity
as L^{0.70 +/- 0.03}. This result is different from previous studies, and
suggests that the effective ionization parameter in AGNs may be a decreasing
function of luminosity. We are also able to constrain, subject to the
assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the BLR gas, the scaling
relation between the mass of the central black hole and the AGN's luminosity.
We find that the central mass scales with the 5100 A luminosity as
M\proptoL^{0.5 +/- 0.1}.
  A program to monitor 11 high-luminosity quasars is presented here for the
first time. Preliminary results from this program indicate continuum variation
of order of 0.1 mag in all objects. We illustrate the importance and
feasibility of monitoring those objects spectrophotometrically. When this

the relationship between 1-D velocity dispersion and mass and the probability
distribution of the spin parameter $P(\lambda)$. The \svm relationship is well
reproduced by the Truncated Isothermal Sphere (TIS) model introduced by Shapiro

series of \svm relationships for different values of the anisotropy parameter
$\beta$, obtained using the theoretical predictions by Lokas and Mamon (2001)
for NFW density profiles are found to be only marginally consistent with the

subsamples of {\em fiducial} equilibrium TIS halos from each of the three
subregions, and we study their properties. For these halos, we do find an
environmental dependence of their properties, in particular of the spin
parameter distribution $P(\lambda)$. We study in more detail the TIS model, and
we find new relationships between the truncation radius and other structural
parameters. No gravitationally bound halo is found having a radius larger than
the critical value for gravithermal instability for TIS halos (\rt $\ge 34.2
r_{0}$, where $r_{0}$ is the core radius of the TIS solution). We do however
find a dependence of this relationship on the environment, like for the
$P(\lambda)$ statistics. These facts hint at a possible r\^{o}le of tidal
fields at determining the statistical properties of halos.

narrower than is typically found in higher luminosity AGN. We argue that this

transition to an advection dominate accretion flow at r ~ 100GM/c^2) or a large
r ~ 100GM/c^2 X-ray emitting corona surrounding the accretion disk. We also
present results for the higher luminosity Seyfert nuclei in NGC5548 and

equivalent width is found to be anticorrelated with the relative strength of
the reflection continuum, contrary to all simple reflection models. It is
proposed that continuum-flux correlated changes in the ionization of the

Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. (2) The abundance patterns among

dex, whereas the halo field star sample has [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.28 dex over the same
range in metallicity. (4) The most metal-rich dSph stars in our sample have
[Y/Fe] abundances which are significantly lower than those measured for halo
field stars of similar metallicity, while the measured [Ba/Eu] ratios for the
dSph stars suggest that the early chemical evolution of these galaxies was

spectroscopy (1500 - 2000A) of two low-redshift narrow-line radio galaxies
(NLRGs) taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). Spectropolarimetry of several NLRGs has shown that, by the
presence of broad permitted lines in polarized flux spectrum, they have hidden
quasars seen through scattered light. Imaging polarimetry has shown that NLRGs
including our targets often have large scattering regions of a few kpc to >~10
kpc scale. This has posed a problem about the nature of the scatterers in these
radio galaxies. Their polarized continuum has the spectral index similar to or
no bluer than that of quasars, which favors electrons as the dominant
scattering particles. The large scattering region size, however, favors dust
scattering, because of its higher scattering efficiency compared to electrons.
In this paper, we investigate the polarized flux spectrum over a wide
wavelength range, combining our UV data with previous optical/infrared
polarimetry data. We infer that the scattering would be often caused by opaque
dust clouds in the NLRGs and this would be a part of the reason for the
apparently grey scattering. In the high-redshift radio galaxies, these opaque
clouds could be the proto-galactic subunits inferred to be seen in the HST

scattering, which could imply the existence of a large gas mass surrounding

results are analysed in terms of a `local' formula with the associated Coulomb
logarithm taken as a free parameter. For forced circular orbits, the asymptotic
value of the component of the drag force in the direction of the velocity is a
slowly varying function of the Mach number in the range 1.0-1.6. The dynamical
friction timescale for free decay orbits is typically only half as long as in
the case of a collisionless background, which is in agreement with E.C.
Ostriker's recent analytic result. The orbital decay rate is rather insensitive
to the past history of the perturber. It is shown that, similar to the case of
stellar systems, orbits are not subject to any significant circularization.
However, the dynamical friction timescales are found to increase with
increasing orbital eccentricity for the Plummer model, whilst no strong

designed to investigate the cosmological evolution of quasar host galaxies from
z~2 to the present day. Here we describe J and H-band NICMOS imaging of two
quasar samples at redshifts of 0.9 and 1.9 respectively. Each sample contains
equal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, selected to lie within the
same narrow range of optical absolute magnitude (-24 > M_V > -25). Filter and
target selection were designed to ensure that at each redshift the images
sample the same part of the object's rest-frame spectrum, avoiding potential
contamination by [OIII]lambda5007 and H-alpha emission lines. At z=1 the hosts
of both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars lie on the same Kormendy relation
described by 3CR radio galaxies at comparable redshift. There is some evidence
for a gap of ~1 mag between the host luminosities of RLQs and RQQs, a
difference that cannot be due to emission-line contamination given the design
of our study. However, within current uncertainties, simple passive stellar
evolution is sufficient to link these galaxies with the elliptical hosts of
low-redshift quasars of comparable nuclear output, implying that the hosts are
virtually fully assembled by z=1. At z=2 the luminosity gap appears to have
widened further to ~1.5 mag. Thus while the hosts of radio-loud quasars remain
consistent with a formation epoch of z>3, allowing for passive evolution
implies that the hosts of radio-quiet quasars are ~2-4 times less massive at
z=2 than at low z.

memory (i=1,2,3,...). The set of functions $S_i(t)$ constitute the quantitative
measure of time correlation disorder $(i=0)$ and time memory disorder
(i=1,2,3,...) in complex system. Harnessing the infinite set of orthogonal
dynamic random variables on a basis of Gram-Shmidt orthogonalization procedure
tends to creation of infinite chain of finite-difference non-Markov kinetic
equations for discrete TCF and memory function.The solution of the equations

senior and junior orders. The results obtained offer considerable scope for
attack on stochastic dynamics of discrete random processes in a complex

Multiple scatterings are treated in Glauber-Gribov theory, which is modified to
include the nuclear form factor to all orders. Based on the mean coherence
length, which is defined in this work, it is estimated that gluon shadowing is
negligible at x_{Bj}>0.01. Parameter free calculations are compared to NMC and

propagation amplitude between two geometries $<g_{ij} (2), t_2| g_{ij} (1),

physics have found applications in other fields, in particular atomic physics.
A few results can be extended to cases involving spin-dependent forces or
relativistic kinematics.

superconducting niobium cavities, operated in pulsed mode. Within the framework
of an international collaboration the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) has been set up
at DESY, providing the infrastructure for cavity R&D towards higher gradients.
More than 60 nine-cell cavities were tested, accelerating gradients as high as
30 MV/m were measured. In the second production of TTF-cavities the average
gradient was measured to be 24.7 MV/m. Two modules, each containing eight
resonators, are presently used in the TTF-linac. These cavities are operated in
pulsed mode: 0.8 ms constant gradient with up to 10 Hz repetitions rate. We
will focus on two aspects: Firstly, the cavity fabrication and treatment is
discussed, allowing to reach high gradients. Latest results of single cell
cavities will be shown, going beyond 40 MV/m. Secondly, the pulsed mode
operation of superconducting cavities is reviewed. This includes Lorentz force
detuning, mechanical vibrations (microphonics) and rf field control. Both
topics meet the upcoming interest in superconducting proton linacs, like the sc
driver linac for SNS (Spallation Neutron Source).

oblique angle in periodic structures results in a wide transverse exponential
field distribution corresponding to strong angular confinement of the
radiation. The beam expansion follows an effective diffusive equation depending
only upon the spectral mode width. In the presence of gain, the beam cross
section is limited only by the size of the gain area. As an example of an
active periodic photonic medium, we calculate and measure laser emission from a
dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal film.

  Using Parallel Supercomputers",,"eConfC000821:MOA19,2000",,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  In this paper we present results of using parallel supercomputers to simulate
beam dynamics in next-generation high intensity ion linacs. Our approach uses a
three-dimensional space charge calculation with six types of boundary
conditions. The simulations use a hybrid approach involving transfer maps to
treat externally applied fields (including rf cavities) and parallel
particle-in-cell techniques to treat the space-charge fields. The large-scale
simulation results presented here represent a three order of magnitude
improvement in simulation capability, in terms of problem size and speed of
execution, compared with typical two-dimensional serial simulations. Specific
examples will be presented, including simulation of the spallation neutron
source (SNS) linac and the Low Energy Demonstrator Accelerator (LEDA) beam halo
experiment.

length L and arithmetic modulo k^{L}. An abstract representation on an L fold
tensor product Hilbert space H^{arith} of number states and operators for the
basic arithmetic operations is described. Unitary maps onto a physical
parameter based tensor product space H^{phy} are defined and the relations
between these two spaces and the dependence of algorithm dynamics on the
unitary maps is discussed. The important condition of efficient implementation
by physically realizable Hamiltonians of the basic arithmetic operations is
also discussed.

theoretically and experimentally. In the first case, we develop the density
operator representing a single photon state subjected to a non-dissipative
coupling between observed (polarization) and unobserved (frequency) degrees of
freedom. We show that an implementation of ``bang-bang'' quantum control
protects photon polarization information from certain types of decoherence. In
the second case, we investigate the existence of a ""decoherence-free"" subspace
of the Hilbert space of two-photon polarization states under the action of a
similar coupling. The density operator representation is developed analytically
and solutions are obtained numerically.
