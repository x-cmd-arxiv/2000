deep multicolor imaging obtained during the Science Verification of FORS1 at
the VLT. The image quality (half arcsec seeing) and depth of the VLT images
allow the shear signal to be mapped with high signal-to-noise and to be traced
out to 1.2 h_50^-1 Mpc, near the edge of the 6'.8x6'.8 field of view. Using
BVRI color information, as well as 81 redshifts in the field from the CNOC
survey, background galaxies can be effectively separated from cluster and
foreground objects. PSF distorsions are found to be moderate across the FORS
images and thus easily removed. Due to the small statistical errors in the mass
reconstruction, this dataset provides a testing ground where several systematic
effects (e.g. mass-sheet degeneracy, redshift distribution of the background
sources, cluster galaxy contamination) can be quantified. Several methods are
used to remove the mass-sheet degeneracy which is found to dominate the
systematic error budget. We measure a lower limit to the mass of 2.6 10^14
h_50^-1 M_sun within 1 h_50^-1 Mpc and a ``total'' mass of 5.3 10^14 h_50^-1
M_sun by fitting a softened isothermal sphere. The availability of the CNOC
redshift data and X-ray observations on this cluster allow a comparison of
different determinations of the mass radial profile. We find the lensing and
X-ray measurements in excellent agreement, while the mass derived from the
virial analysis is marginally (1-2 sigma) in agreement at radii where both
methods are reliable.

AGNs has different properties than in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium.
By comparing the reddening of optical and infrared broad lines and the X-ray
absorbing column density we find that the E(B-V)/N_H ratio is nearly always
lower than Galactic by a factor ranging from ~3 up to ~100. Other observational
results indicate that the Av/N_H ratio is significantly lower than Galactic in
various classes of AGNs including intermediate type 1.8-1.9 Seyferts, hard
X-ray selected and radio selected quasars, broad absorption line QSOs and grism
selected QSOs. The lack of prominent absorption features at 9.7um (silicates)
and at 2175A (carbon dip) in the spectra of Seyfert 2s and of reddened Seyfert
1s, respectively, add further evidence for dust in the circumnuclear region of
AGNs being different from Galactic.
  These observational results indicate that the dust composition in the
circumnuclear region of AGNs could be dominated by large grains, which make the
extinction curve flatter, featureless and are responsible for the reduction of
the E(B-V)/N_H and Av/N_H ratios.
  Regardless of the physical origin of these phenomena, the reduced dust
absorption with respect to what expected from the gaseous column density should
warn about a mismatch between the optical and the X-ray classification of the
active galactic nuclei in terms of their obscuration.

six sudden rotational spinups or glitches, doubling the number of glitches
observed for this pulsar since 1969. With these observations, the range of time
intervals between significant Crab glitches has widened considerably,
indicating that the occurrence of Crab glitches may be more random than
previously thought. The new glitch amplitudes ($\Delta\nu/\nu$) span an order
of magnitude from 2e-9 to 3e-8. Except in one case, which we suggest may
represent an ``aftershock'' event, the frequency jumps display an exponential
recovery with a timescale of $\sim$3 days for the smaller glitches and $\sim$10
days for the largest (1996) glitch. In the largest event, a portion of the
spinup was resolved in time, as was previously reported for the 1989 glitch. A
pronounced change in frequency derivative also occurs after each glitch and is
correlated with the size of the initial frequency jump, although for some of
the smaller glitches this appears to be a temporary effect. We discuss the
properties of the ensemble of observed Crab glitches and compare them with the
properties of Vela glitches, highlighting those differences which must be
explained by evolutionary models.

between the white dwarf spin and binary orbit. The light curves vary from epoch
to epoch and as a function of waveband. The dereddened UV spectrum is extremely
bright and the spectral energy distribution coupled with the duration of
eclipse ingress indicate that the dominant source of energy is a hot
(T~35,000K) white dwarf. Undiminished line emission through eclipse indicates
that the eclipse is caused by the accretion stream, not the secondary star. The
hot white dwarf, combined with its current asynchronous nature and rapid
timescale for relocking, suggests that V1432 Aql underwent a nova eruption in
the past 75-150 yr. The reversed sense of asynchronism, with the primary star
currently spinning up toward synchronism, is not necessarily at odds with this

northeastern red lobe and at the position ~50"" east of the IRAS source. Strong
SiO emission observed at ~50"" east of the IRAS source presents evidence for a
dynamical interaction between a part of the eastern blue lobe and the dense
ambient gas condensation, however, such an interaction is unlikely to be
responsible for producing the quadrupolar morphology. The SiO emission in the
northeastern red lobe shows the spatial and velocity structure similar to those
of the CO outflow, suggesting that the SiO emission comes from the molecular
outflow in the northeastern red lobe itself. The observed velocity structure is
reproduced by a simple spatio-kinematic model of bow shock with a shock
velocity of 19-24 km/s inclined by 30-45 deg from the plane of the sky. This
implies that the northeastern red lobe is independent of the eastern blue lobe
and that the quadrupolar structure is due to two separate bipolar outflows.
  The SiO emission observed in the western red lobe has a broad pedestal shape
with low intensity. Unlike the SiO emission in the northeastern red lobe, the
spatial extent of the SiO emission in the western red lobe is restricted to its
central region. The spatial and velocity structures and the line profiles
suggest that three different types of the SiO emission are observed in this
outflow; the SiO emission arises from the interface between the outflowing gas
and the dense ambient gas clump, the SiO emission coming from the outflow lobe
itself, and the broad SiO emission with low intensity observed at the central
region of the outflow lobe.

of Rieffel) in the presence of curvature and non-Abelian group actions. More
precisely, we use geometry to obtain explicit oscillatory integral formulae for
strongly invariant strict deformation quantizations of a class of solvable
symplectic symmetric spaces. Each of these quantizations gives rise to a field
of (pre)-C*-algebras whose fibers are function algebras which are closed under
the deformed product. The symmetry group of the symmetric space acts on each
fiber by C*-algebra automorphisms.

corresponding equations may be said to be integrable, at least in the sense of

conservation laws. In this paper the dispersionless limits of these Jordan KdV
equations are studied, under the assumptions that the Jordan algebra has a
unity element and a compatible non-degenerate inner product. Much of this
structure may be encoded in a so-called Jordan manifold, akin to a Frobenius
manifold. In particular the Hamiltonian properties of these systems are
investigated.

C63 (2001) 044907","10.1103/PhysRevC.63.044907",,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  We use Dirac's constraint dynamics to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation of the
relativistic N-body problem in a separable two-body basis in which the
particles interact pair-wise through scalar and vector interactions. The
resultant N-body Hamiltonian is relativistically covariant. It can be easily
separated in terms of the center-of-mass and the relative motion of any
two-body subsystem. It can also be separated into an unperturbed Hamiltonian
with a residual interaction. In a system of two-body composite particles, the
solutions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are relativistic two-body internal
states, each of which can be obtained by solving a relativistic
Schr\""odinger-like equation. The resultant two-body wave functions can be used
as basis states to evaluate reaction matrix elements in the general N-body
problem. We prove a relativistic version of the post-prior equivalence which
guarantees a unique evaluation of the reaction matrix element, independent of
the ways of separating the Hamiltonian into unperturbed and residual
interactions. Since an arbitrary reaction matrix element involves composite
particles in motion, we show explicitly how such matrix elements can be
evaluated in terms of the wave functions of the composite particles and the
relevant Lorentz transformations.

subsequent crater development near field emission sites on a copper surface in
the presence of a strong dc electric field. Adding to previously published
models, we propose that the two-stream plasma instability relates the plasma
density to its dimensions. Arguments are presented that suggest that the
formation and dynamics of such plasma spots are essentially the same phenomenon
for both dc and rf fields. A consequence for accelerating structures is that,
when such plasma spots are present, they erode the copper surface at a rate on
the order of 300 micrograms per Coulomb of ion bombardment current. This
erosion rate can have a measurable effect on the rf properties of an
accelerating structure after processing at high gradients for a few hundred
hours.
