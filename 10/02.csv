non-Gaussian cosmic fields. The method can be adapted to include the nonlinear
effects in galaxy redshift surveys, weak lensing surveys and cosmic velocity
field surveys as part of parameter estimation. It can also be used as a test of
non-Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Generalising Maximum
Likelihood analysis to second-order, we calculate the nonlinear Fisher
Information matrix and likelihood surfaces in parameter space. To this order we
find that the information content is always increased by including
nonlinearity. Our methods are applied to a realistic model of a galaxy redshift
survey, including nonlinear evolution, galaxy bias, shot-noise and
redshift-space distortions to second-order. We find that including
nonlinearities allows all of the degeneracies between parameters to be lifted.
Marginalised parameter uncertainties of a few percent will then be obtainable
using forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.

SGRs, and the case made for a close connection between the two types of
sources. Their collective properties point to the existence of {\it magnetars}:
neutron stars in which a decaying magnetic field (rather than accretion or
rotation) is the dominant source of energy for radiative and particle
emissions. Observational tests of the magnetar model are outlined, along with
current ideas about the trigger of SGR outbursts, new evidence for the trapped
fireball model, and the influence of QED processes on X-ray spectra and
lightcurves. A critical examination is made of coherent radio emission from
bursting strong-field neutron stars. I conclude with an overview of the genetic
connection between neutron star magnetism and the violent fluid motions in a

The
main features of the new theory are that the dispersive-inductive components of
the interaction (van der Waals forces) have been included, and the resonance
components have been computed by perturbation theory without the use of the
multipole expansion. The theory is applied to lower Balmer lines and the
theoretical and observational impact of the new broadening theory is examined.
It is shown that this theory leads to considerable differences in the predicted
line profiles in cool stars when compared with previous theories which include
only resonance interactions. In particular, the effect is found to be very
important in metal poor stars. The theory provides a natural explanation for
the behaviour of effective temperatures derived from Balmer lines by others
using a theory which includes only resonance broadening. When applied to Balmer
lines in the solar spectrum the theory predicts an improved agreement between
observed and computed profiles for models which also match limb darkening
curves and rules out a model which does not. However significant discrepancies
still remain which could be due to inadequacies in our theory or the
atmospheric model or both.

galaxies and their older stellar populations. The exquisite stable high spatial
resolution combined with photometric accuracy of images from the Hubble Space
Telescope have allowed us to probe further back into the history of star
formation of a large variety of different galaxy types with widely differing
star formation properties. We have learnt several important things about dwarf
galaxy evolution from these studies. Firstly we have found that no two galaxies
have identical star formation histories; some galaxies may superficially look
the same today, but they have invariably followed different paths to this
point. Now that we have managed to probe deep into the star formation history
of dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Group it is obvious that there are a
number of similarities with the global properties of dwarf
elliptical/spheroidal type galaxies, which were previously thought to be quite
distinct. The previous strong dichotomy between these two classes has been
weakened by these new results and may stem from the differences in the
environment in which these similar mass galaxies were born into or have
inhabited for most of their lives. The more detailed is our understanding of
star formation processes and their effect on galaxy evolution in the nearby
Universe the better we will understand the results from studies of the
integrated light of galaxies in the high-redshift Universe.

claims of a possible second companion around the brightest star Sirius-A. Such
a companion could, in particular, be responsible of the suspected colour change
of the star, now strongly suggested from two independent historical sources. We
reported here on a new observation of the sky region around Sirius, to search
for such a companion, using a coronographic device.
  By comparison of the new stellar field with a similar image obtained by us
$\sim$13 yr ago and using the Sirius proper motion, we are able to eliminate
the most obvious companion candidates down to a magnitude m$_v$$\sim$17 in a
field from 30 arcsec to 2.5 arcmin of the central star. None of the visible
stars appears consistent in magnitude and colours with what expected from
current theoretical models and observations of low-mass stars.
  From the study of the same field, it is also shown that the Sirius companion,
consistently reported by observers during the years 1920-1930, is most probably
an unrelated m$_g$$\simeq$12 background star, now $\sim$ 1 arcmin away but
located precisely on the Sirius proper motion trajectory. The closest apparent
conjunction with Sirius was realized in 1937 with a minimum angular distance of
6.9 arcsec, of the same order than the Sirius A-B binary separation.
  The reported observations do not eliminate the possibility of a second
companion but now confined the search to the more central 30 arcsec region
around Sirius. In particular, the existence of a long period companion cannot
definitively be ruled out since the arbitrary orientation of the orbit can
yield an observed projected position on sky inside this more central region.

techniques and multi-wavelength (BRHK,H alpha) imaging data to investigate the
nature of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the edge-on, low surface brightness
(LSB) galaxy UGC7321. Using realistic models that incorporate multiple
scattering effects and clumping of the stars and the interstellar material, we
explore the distribution and opacity of the interstellar material (gas+dust),
and its effects on the observed stellar disk luminosity profiles, color
gradients, and rotation curve shape. We find that UGC7321 contains a small but
non-negligible dusty component to its ISM, yielding a B-band optical depth
tau_e,B~4.0 from disk edge to center. A significant fraction (~50+/-10%) of the
interstellar material in the innermost regions of UGC7321 appears to be
contained in a clumpy medium, indicating that LSB galaxies can support a
modest, multi-phase ISM structure. In spite of the clear presence of dust, we
conclude that the large radial optical color gradients observed in UGC7321 and
other similar LSB spiral galaxies cannot be accounted for by dust and must
result primarily from significant stellar population and/or metallicity
gradients. We show that realistic optical depth effects will have little impact
on the observed rotation curves of edge-on disk galaxies and cannot explain the
linear, slowly rising rotation curves seen in some edge-on LSB spirals.
Projection effects create a far larger uncertainty in recovering the true
underlying rotation curve shape of galaxies viewed at inclinations i>85
degrees.

regard to the wide range of systems where the method may be applied. Parisi's
partial differential equation and related differential equations are discussed,
and a Green function technique introduced for the calculation of replica
averages, the key to determining the averages of physical quantities. The
ensuing graph rules involve only tree graphs, as appropriate for a
mean-field-like model. The lowest order Ward-Takahashi identity is recovered
analytically and is shown to lead to the Goldstone modes in continuous replica
symmetry breaking phases. The need for a replica symmetry breaking theory in
the storage problem of the neuron has arisen due to the thermodynamical
instability of formerly given solutions. Variational forms for the neuron's
free energy are derived in terms of the order parameter function x(q), for
different prior distribution of synapses. Analytically in the high temperature
limit and numerically in generic cases various phases are identified, among
them one similar to the Parisi phase in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.

transitions are investigated and shown to exhibit very different
characteristics. For both geometries we show how the conditions for observing
critical (continuous) filling are much less restrictive than for critical
wetting, which is known to require fine tuning of the Hamaker constants. Wedge
filling is critical if the wetting binding potential does not exhibit a local
maximum, whilst conic filling is critical if the integrated strength of the
potential is attractive. This latter scenario is particularly encouraging for
future experimental studies. Using mean-field and effective Hamiltonian
approaches, which allow for breather-mode fluctuations which translate the
interface up and down the sides of the confining geometry, we are able to
completely classify the possible critical behaviour (for purely thermal
disorder). For the three dimensional wedge, the interfacial fluctuations are
very strong and characterised by a universal roughness critical exponent
$\nu_{\perp} =1/4$ independent of the range of the forces. For the physical
dimensions d=2 and d=3, we show that the influence of the cone geometry on the
fluctuations at critical filling is to mimic the analogous interfacial
behaviour occuring at critical wetting in the strong-fluctuation regime. In
particular, for d=3 and for quite arbitary choices of intermolecular potential,
the filling height and roughness show the same critical properties as those

  1. Data with rich descriptions. For example, wide customer records with many
potentially useful fields allow data mining algorithms to search beyond obvious
correlations.
  2. A large volume of data. The large model spaces corresponding to rich data
demand many training instances to build reliable models.
  3. Controlled and reliable data collection. Manual data entry and integration
from legacy systems both are notoriously problematic; fully automated
collection is considerably better.
  4. The ability to evaluate results. Substantial, demonstrable return on
investment can be very convincing.
  5. Ease of integration with existing processes. Even if pilot studies show
potential benefit, deploying automated solutions to previously manual processes
is rife with pitfalls. Building a system to take advantage of the mined
knowledge can be a substantial undertaking. Furthermore, one often must deal
with social and political issues involved in the automation of a previously

expressions into normal form [1]. It is difficult to prove that this function
terminates on all inputs. Three termination proofs are compared: (1) using a
measure function, (2) in domain theory using LCF, (3) showing that its
recursion relation, defined by the pattern of recursive calls, is well-founded.
The last two proofs are essentially the same though conducted in markedly
different logical frameworks. An obviously total variant of the normalize
function is presented as the `computational meaning' of those two proofs. A
related function makes nested recursive calls. The three termination proofs
become more complex: termination and correctness must be proved simultaneously.
The recursion relation approach seems flexible enough to handle subtle
termination proofs where previously domain theory seemed essential.

$M:\llo\longrightarrow\llo,$ can be seen to be equivalent to the boundedness of
the Hardy operator $A$ restricted to decreasing functions of $L^p(w)$. The
class of weights satisfying this boundedness is known as $B_p$. Even though the
$A_p$ and $B_p$ classes enjoy some similar features, they come from very
different theories, and so are the techniques used on each case:
Calder\'on--Zygmund decompositions and covering lemmas for $A_p$, rearrangement
invariant properties and positive integral operators for $B_p$. It is our aim
to give a unified version of these two theories. Contrary to what one could
expect, the solution is not given in terms of the limiting cases above
considered (i.e., $u=1$ and $w=1$), but in a rather more complicated condition,
which reflects the difficulty of estimating the distribution function of the
Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator with respect to general measures.

of this relation is that the Picard group of line bundles on an algebraic
manifold is isomorphic to the group of divisors, which is generated by
holomorphic hypersurfaces modulo linear equivalence. A similar correspondence
can be made between the K-group of sheaves and the Chow ring of holomorphic
cycles. There are two more very recent examples of such a relation. The mirror
symmetry in string theory has revealed a deeper phenomenon involving special
Lagrangian cycles (cf. [SYZ]). On the other hand, C. Taubes has shown that the
Seiberg-Witten invariant coincides with the Gromov-Witten invariant on any

get lighter in dense medium at some density $\rho >\rho_0$ due to the
decoupling of the vector mesons. As a consequence, kaon condensation in compact
stars could take place {\it before} chiral restoration since the sum of bare

decoupling vector interactions is that the quasi-particle picture involving

The number of resonance states in this system increases as the strength of the
driving field is increased, indicating that this system might have increased
stability against ionization when the field strength is very high. We find that
the newly created resonance states are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of
the classical motion. The behavior of these periodic orbits as the field
strength is increased may explain why there are more resonance states at high
field strengths than at low field strengths. Close examination of an avoided
crossing between resonance states shows that this type of avoided crossing does
not delocalize the resonance states, although it may lead to interesting
