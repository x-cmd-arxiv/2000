due to the use of homogeneous data both for the clusters and the control fields

presence of large-scale structures and of foreground clusters and groups. The
global composite LF is quite flat down to $M^*+5$ has a slope
$\alpha\sim-1.0\pm0.2$ with minor variations from blue to red filters, and
$M^*\sim-21.8,-22.0,-22.3$ mag ($H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) in the $g, r$

dust emission from HD 56126 (IRAS 07134+1005), a post-Asymptotic Giant Branch
carbon star with a detached dust shell. The gross morphology of the image can
be explained by a strong wind which started to die about 1500 years ago. If the
star had an effective temperature near 2600 K when it was losing a large amount
of mass, then during the past 1500 years, the average value of dT/dt has been
+2.2 K/yr. With such a time variation of the effective temperture of the star,
the 11.7 micron image can be approximately reproduced if the mass loss rate
varied as T^(-8.26), as proposed in recent models for dust-driven winds. Since
the mass loss rate appears to be very sensitive to the effective temperature of
the star, we speculate that the observed deviations from spherical symmetry of
the dust shell can be explained by plausible variations in the surface
temperature of the mass-losing star caused by rotation and/or magnetic fields.

starburst site in which an intense episode of star formation occurred over 100
Myr ago, and our new observations confirm this intepretation. We find a large,
evolved system of super star clusters in M82 B; we identify a total of 113
super star cluster candidates. The clusters range in absolute magnitude from
M_V^0 = -6 to -10, with a peak at -7.5. The derived age distribution suggests
steady, continuing cluster formation at a modest rate at early times (> 2 Gyr
ago), followed by a concentrated formation episode ~600 Myr ago and more recent
suppression of cluster formation. The peak episode coincides with independent
dynamical estimates for the last tidal encounter with M81. Our J and H band
observations resolve the bright giant population in M82's disk for the first
time. Star formation evidently continued in M82 B until about 20-30 Myr ago,

starburst (age <= 15 Myr). After correcting the cluster luminosity function to

both observers and theorists for 30 years, and have been widely regarded as one
of the most critical and potentially insightful aspects of their emission.
Here, we report on detailed studies of pulsar B0943+10, whose nearly coherent
sequences of ``drifting'' subpulses have permitted us to identify their origin
as a system of subbeams that appear to circulate around the star's magnetic
axis. We introduce several new techniques of analysis, and we find that both
the primary and secondary features in the star's fluctuation spectra are
aliases of their actual values. We have also developed a method of tracing the
underlying pattern responsible for the observed sequences, using a
``cartographic'' transform and its inverse, permitting us to study the
characteristics of the polar-cap emission ``map'' and to confirm that such a
``map'' in turn represents the observed sequence. We apply these techniques to
the study of three different Arecibo observations. The ``B''-mode sequences are
consistent in revealing that the emission pattern consists of 20 subbeams,
which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 37 periods or 41 seconds. Even
in the ``Q'' mode sequence, we find evidence of a compatible circulation time.
The similarity of the subbeam patterns at different radio frequencies strongly
suggests that the radiation is produced within a set of columns, which extend
from close to the stellar surface up though the emission region and reflect
some manner of a ``seeding''phenomenon at their base. The subbeam emission is
then tied neither to the stellar surface nor to the field.

consistent with independent measurements carried out at the same epoch (Biggs
et al. 1999), lending confidence in the robustness of the time delay
measurement. However, since both measurements make use of the same features in
the light curves, it is possible that the effects of unmodelled processes, such
as scintillation or microlensing, are biasing both time delay measurements in
the same way. Our time delay estimates result in confidence intervals that are
somewhat larger than those of Biggs et al., probably because we adopt a more
general model of the source variability, allowing for constant and variable
components. When considered in relation to the lens mass model of Biggs et al.,
our best-fit time delay implies a Hubble constant of H_o = 71(+17-23) km/s-Mpc
for Omega_o=1 and lambda_o=0 (95% confidence; filled beam). This confidence
interval for H_o does not reflect systematic error, which may be substantial,
due to uncertainty in the position of the lens galaxy. We also measure the flux
ratio of the variable components of 0218+357, a measurement of a small region
that should more closely represent the true lens magnification ratio. We find
ratios of 3.2(+0.3-0.4) (95% confidence; 8 GHz) and 4.3(+0.5-0.8) (15 GHz).
Unlike the reported flux ratios on scales of 0.1"", these ratios are not
strongly significantly different. We investigate the significance of apparent
differences in the variability properties of the two images of the background
active galactic nucleus. We conclude that the differences are not significant,
and that time series much longer than our 100-day time series will be required
to investigate propagation effects in this way.

in the spectral energy distributions of objects such as the prototype Class 0
source VLA 1623, pure collapse models require mass infall rates
$\sim10^{-4}\msun$yr$^{-1}$. The radial intensity distributions predicted by
such infall models are inconsistent with observations of VLA 1623 at sub-mm
wavelengths, in agreement with the results of Andre et al. (1993) who found a
density profile of $\rho \propto r^{-1/2}$ rather than the expected $\rho
\propto r^{-3/2}$ gradient. To resolve this conflict, while still invoking
infall to produce the outflow source at the center of VLA 1623, we suggest that
the observed sub-mm intensity distribution is the sum of two components: an
inner infall zone, plus an outer, more nearly constant-density region. This
explanation of the observations requires that roughly half the total mass
observed within 2000 AU radius of the source lies in a region external to the
infall zone. The column densities for this external region are comparable to
those found in the larger Oph A cloud within which VLA 1623 is embedded. The
extreme environments of Class 0 sources lead us to suggest an alternative or
additional interpretation of these objects: rather than simply concluding with
Andre et al. that Class 0 objects only represent the earliest phases of
protostellar collapse, and ultimately evolve into older ``Class I'' protostars,
we suggest that many Class 0 sources could be the protostars of very dense

  Journal",,"10.1086/318694",,"astro-ph",,"  We have determined elemental abundance ratios in the core of the Perseus
cluster for several elements. These ratios indicate a central dominance of SN
Ia ejecta similar to that found for A496, A2199 and A3571 (Dupke & White 2000).
Simultaneous analysis of ASCA spectra from SIS1, GIS 2&3 shows that the ratio
of Ni to Fe abundances is ~ (3.4 +- 1.1) times Solar within the central 4'.
This ratio is consistent with (and more precise than) that observed in other
clusters whose central regions are dominated by SN Ia ejecta. Such a large Ni
over-abundance is predicted by ""Convective Deflagration"" explosion models for
SN Ia such as ""W7"" but is inconsistent with delayed detonation models. We note
that with current instrumentation the NiK(alpha) line is confused with
FeK(beta) and that the Ni over-abundance we observe has been interpreted by
others as an anomalously large ratio of FeK(beta) to FeK(alpha) caused by
resonant scattering in the FeK(alpha) line. We argue that a central enhancement
of SN Ia ejecta and hence a high ratio of Ni to Fe is naturally explained by
scenarios that include the generation of chemical gradients by suppressed SN Ia
winds or ram-pressure stripping of cluster galaxies. It is not necessary to
suppose that the intracluster gas is optically thick to resonant scattering of
the FeK(alpha) line.

with near certainty for two cases. (i) We find that the runaway star zeta
Ophiuchi and the pulsar PSR J1932+1059 originated about 1 Myr ago in a
supernova explosion in a binary in the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco OB2
association. The pulsar received a kick velocity of about 350 km/s in this
event, which dissociated the binary, and gave zeta Oph its large space
velocity. (ii) Blaauw & Morgan and Gies & Bolton already postulated a common
origin for the runaway-pair AE Aur and mu Col, possibly involving the massive
highly-eccentric binary iota Ori, based on their equal and opposite velocities.
We demonstrate that these three objects indeed occupied a very small volume
\sim 2.5Myr ago, and show that they were ejected from the nascent Trapezium
cluster.
  We identify the parent group for two more pulsars: both likely originate in
the 50 Myr old association Per OB3, which contains the open cluster alpha
Persei. At least 21 of the 56 runaway stars in our sample can be linked to the
nearby associations and young open clusters. These include the classical
runaways 53 Arietis (Ori OB1), xi Persei (Per OB2), and lambda Cephei (Cep
OB3), and fifteen new identifications, amongst which a pair of stars running
away in opposite directions from the region containing the lambda Ori cluster.

extrapolated, corresponding to ~2 per cent of the Eddington limit for a 10

shape with great accuracy. Simple models of Compton up-scattering of seed
photons from the accretion disk do not adequately match the spectrum. At low
energies an additional continuum component is required, giving a complex soft
excess which extends up to ~4 keV, in line with previous results from ASCA.
Moreover we clearly detect a reflected component from the accretion disk which
is smeared, probably because of relativistic and Doppler effects. The
reflecting material is not strongly ionized and does not subtend a large solid
angle as seen from the corona. The inner radius of the disk, that depends on
the inclination of the system, is most probably between 10 and 70 gravitational
radii (Rg). An unsmeared reprocessed component, probably originating from the
companion star or the outer disk, could also be present. In this case, the

the Fermi energy below some characteristic temperature T*, also in good
agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The pseudogap is caused by
critical pairing fluctuations in the low-temperature renormalized classical
regime $\omega < T$ of the two-dimensional system. With increasing temperature
the spectral weight fills in the pseudogap instead of closing it and the
pseudogap appears earlier in the density of states than in the spectral

over frequency scales much larger than temperature. Several qualitative results
for the s-wave case should remain true for d-wave superconductors.

complete the two-particle parquet equations we use an integral form of the Ward

to a holomorphic property closely related to the one recently considered by
Ruelle and D'Antoni-Zsido and shared by a natural class of non-equilibrium
steady states. Our holomorphic property is stronger than the Ruelle's one and
thus selects a restricted class of non-equilibrium steady states. We also
introduce the complete boundedness condition and show this notion to be
equivalent to the Pusz-Woronowicz complete passivity property, hence to the KMS
condition.
  In Quantum Field Theory, the beta-boundedness condition can be interpreted as
the property that localized state vectors have energy density levels increasing
beta-subexponentially, a property which is similar in the form and weaker in
the spirit than the modular compactness-nuclearity condition. In particular,
for a Poincare' covariant net of C*-algebras on the Minkowski spacetime, the
beta-boundedness property, for beta greater equal than 2 pi, for the boosts is
shown to be equivalent to the Bisognano-Wichmann property. The Hawking
temperature is thus minimal for a thermodynamical system in the background of a
Rindler black hole within the class of beta-holomorphic states. More generally,
concerning the Killing evolution associated with a class of stationary quantum
black holes, we characterize KMS thermal equilibrium states at Hawking
temperature in terms of the boundedness property and the existence of a
translation symmetry on the horizon.

function field in one variable k(t), namely there exists a finite field
extension $F/k(t)$, Galois with group G, such that F is a regular extension of
k (i.e. k is algebraically closed in F). Moreover, one may arrange that a given
k-place of k(t) be totally split in F. Harbater proved this theorem for k an
arbitrary complete valued field. Rather formal arguments ([10, \S 4.5]; \S2
hereafter) then imply that the theorem holds over any `large' field k. This in
turn is a special case of a result of Pop [15], hence will be referred to as
the Harbater/Pop theorem. We refer to [10], [16], [6] for precise references to
the literature (work of D\`ebes, Deschamps, Fried, Haran, Harbater, Jarden,
Liu, Pop, Serre, and V\""olklein).
  Most proofs (see [10], [19, 8.4.4, p.~93] and Liu's contribution to [16]; see
however [15]) first use direct arguments to establish the theorem when G is a
cyclic group (here the nature of the ground field is irrelevant), then proceed
by patching, using either formal or rigid geometry, together with GAGA
theorems.
  In the present paper, where I take the case of algebraically closed fields
for granted, I show how a technique recently developed by Koll\'ar [12] may be
used to give a quite different proof of the Harbater/Pop theorem, when the
`large' field k has characteristic zero. This proof actually gives more than
the original result (see comment after statement of Theorem 1).

oriented. We show that each omniorientation induces a canonical stably complex

an equivariant cobordism ring. As an application, we compute the complex
bordism groups and cobordism ring of an arbitrary omnioriented toric manifold.
We consider a family of examples $B_{i,j}$, which are toric manifolds over
products of simplices, and verify that their natural stably complex structure
is induced by an omniorientation. Studying connected sums of products of the
$B_{i,j}$ allows us to deduce that every complex cobordism class of dimension
>2 contains a toric manifold, necessarily connected, and so provides a positive
answer to the toric analogue of Hirzebruch's famous question for algebraic
varieties. In previous work, we dealt only with disjoint unions, and ignored
the relationship between the stably complex structure and the action of the
torus. In passing, we introduce a notion of connected sum $#$ for simple
$n$-dimensional polytopes; when $P^n$ is a product of simplices, we describe
$P^n# Q^n$ by applying an appropriate sequence of {\it pruning operators}, or

measuring the spatial distributions of neutrons in nuclei with unprecedented
accuracy. Parity violation arises from the interference of electromagnetic and
weak neutral amplitudes, and the $Z^0$ of the Standard Model couples primarily
to neutrons at low $Q^2$. Experiments are now feasible at existing facilities.
We show that theoretical corrections are either small or well understood, which
makes the interpretation clean. A neutron density measurement may have many
implications for nuclear structure, atomic parity nonconservation experiments,

spray across this material septum leading to concerns on beam control, vacuum
quality, radiation damage, etc. due to the lost particles. Therefore, another
configuration without a material septum is also considered. With this
configuration it is more difficult to achieve high field quality near the
transition region. Shaped shims are designed to limit the degradation of beam
quality (emittance growth). This approach is closely related to a previous
septum magnet design with two oppositely oriented dipole field regions
presented by the authors [1]. Simulations are performed to obtain the magnetic
field profile in both designs. A PIC simulation is used to transport a beam
slice consisting of several thousand particles through the magnet to estimate
emittance growth in the magnet due to field non-uniformity.

accelerator, the electron-positron linear collider. Many years of dedicated
effort were required to understand the physics of this new technology and to
develop the techniques for maximizing performance. Key issues were emittance
dilution, stability, final beam optimization and background control. Precision,
non-invasive diagnostics were required to measure and monitor the beams
throughout the machine. Beam-based feedback systems were needed to stabilize
energy, trajectory, intensity and the final beam size at the interaction point.
A variety of new tuning techniques were developed to correct for residual
optical or alignment errors. The final focus system underwent a series of
refinements in order to deliver sub-micron size beams. It also took many
iterations to understand the sources of backgrounds and develop the methods to
control them. The benefit from this accumulated experience was seen in the
performance of the SLC during its final run in 1997-98. The luminosity
increased by a factor of three to 3*10**30 and the 350,000 Z data sample
delivered was nearly double that from all previous runs combined.

establish the second law of thermodynamics as strictly deterministic law for
systems of matter and electromagnetic radiation in interaction. He knew he
could not succeed within classical mechanics, but had the somewhat strange hope
that the inclusion of Maxwell's electrodynamics would change the situation.
Later he always disagreed with Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis, because it
implied a renunciation from Maxwell's theory, which in Germany gained full
recognition and acceptance as late as the 1890's, mainly through the
theoretical and experimental work of Heinrich Hertz.

basic physical ideas behind quantum measurements and decoherence. To discuss
decoherence and environment-induced superselection einselection in a more
general setting, we sketch perturbative as well as exact derivations of several
master equations valid for various systems. Using these equations we study
einselection employing the general strategy of the predictability sieve.
Assumptions that are usually made in the discussion of decoherence are
critically reexamined along with the ``standard lore'' to which they lead.
Restoration of quantum-classical correspondence in systems that are classically
chaotic is discussed. The dynamical second law -it is shown- can be traced to
the same phenomena that allow for the restoration of the correspondence
principle in decohering chaotic systems (where it is otherwise lost on a very
short time-scale). Quantum error correction is discussed as an example of an
anti-decoherence strategy. Implications of decoherence and einselection for the
interpretation of quantum theory are briefly pointed out.
