matter halos to simulate the background of decay products from neutralino
annihilation, such as gamma-rays or neutrinos. Halos are non-spherical, have
steep singular density profiles and contain many thousands of surviving dark
matter substructure clumps. This leads to several unique signatures in the
gamma-ray background that may be confirmed or rejected by the next generation
of gamma-ray experiments. Most importantly, the diffuse background is enhanced
by over two orders of magnitude due to annihilation within substructure halos.
The largest dark substructures are easily visibly above the background and may
account for the unidentified EGRET sources. A deep strip survey of the
gamma-ray background would allow the shape of the Galactic halo to be
quantified.

of previous CCD observations of NGC 4472. We have combined the Mosaic data with
spectroscopic data and HST data in order to fully characterize the level of
contamination in our GC sample. The radial profile of the GC system is fit
fairly well by a de Vaucouleurs law out to 17 arc minutes (~80 kpc), but the
profile falls slightly below the de Vaucouleurs law between 17 and 23 arc
minutes. The bimodal color distribution observed in past studies appears in our

vanishes, however, when the entire radial extent of the data is taken into
account. We estimate a total of 5,900 GCs in NGC 4472 out to 23 arc minutes,

evidences for ""anomalous"" dust properties in the circumnuclear region of AGNs
and, in particular, the reduced E(B-V)/N_H and Av/N_H ratios, the absence of
the silicate absorption feature in mid-IR spectra of Sy2s and the absence of
the carbon dip in UV spectra of reddened Sy1s. In this paper we discuss various
explanations for these facts.
  The observational constraints favor a scenario where coagulation, catalyzed
by the high densities in the circumnuclear region, yields to the formation of
large grains. The resulting extinction curve is featureless, flatter than
Galactic and the E(B-V)/N_H and Av/N_H ratios are significantly reduced. These
results should warn about an unappropriate use of the standard Galactic
extinction curve and Av/N_H ratio when dealing with the extreme gas conditions
typical of the circumnuclear clouds of AGNs.
  We also investigated alternative scenarios for the observed anomalous
properties of dust in AGNs. Some of these scenarios might explain some of the
observed properties for a few objects, but they generally fail to account for
all of the observational constraints obtained for the large sample of AGNs
studied in these works.

process for the rapid-process (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We have examined the
features of a steady, subsonic, and rigidly rotating jet in which the
centrifugal force is balanced by the magnetic force. As for the models in which
the magnetic field is weak and angular velocity is small, we found that the
r-process does not occur because the final temperature is kept to be too high
and the dynamical timescale becomes too long when the neutrino luminosities are
set to be high. Even if the luminosities of the neutrinos are set to be low,
which results in the low final temperature, we found that the models do not
give a required condition to produce the r-process matter. Furthermore, the
amount of the mass outflow seems to be too little to explain the solar-system
abundance ratio in such low-luminosity models. As for the models in which the
magnetic field is strong and angular velocity is large, we found that the
entropy per baryon becomes too small and the dynamical timescale becomes too
long. This tendency is, of course, a bad one for the production of the
r-process nuclei. As a conclusion, we have to say that it is difficult to cause
a successful r-process nucleosynthesis in the jet models in this study.

of clusters of various masses as a function of redshift. We determine the
amount of background radiation produced by clusters. The total mean intensity,

subclusters, the amount of EUV background radiation should be larger at present

field galaxies of known redshift, and as such permits us to reconstruct the
shear profile of the typical field galaxy halo in absolute physical units
(modulo H_0), and to investigate the dependence of halo mass upon galaxy
luminosity. This is also the first galaxy-galaxy lensing study for which the
calibration errors are negligible. Within a projected radius of 200 \hkpc, the
shear profile is consistent with an isothermal profile with circular velocity
164+-20 km/s for an L* galaxy, consistent with typical disk rotation at this
luminosity. This halo mass normalization, combined with the halo profile
derived by Fischer et al (2000) from lensing analysis SDSS data, places a lower
limit of (2.7+-0.6) x 10^{12}h^{-1} solar masses on the mass of an L* galaxy
halo, in good agreement with satellite galaxy studies. Given the known
luminosity function of LCRS galaxies, and the assumption that $M\propto

drift of 3.58 +/- 0.41 Hz (1 sigma) represents the largest fractional change in
frequency (1.32 +/- 0.15 %) yet observed in any burst oscillation. If the
asymptotic frequency of the oscillation is interpreted in terms of a decoupled
surface burning layer, the implied neutron star spin period is around 3.7 ms.
However, the expansion of the burning layer required to explain frequency drift
during the burst is around 80 m, substantially larger than expected
theoretically (assuming rigid rotation). The oscillation was not present in the
persistent emission before the burst, nor in the initial rise. When detected
its amplitude was 6-12% (RMS) with a roughly sinusoidal profile. The burst
containing the oscillation showed no evidence for photospheric radius
expansion, while at least 5 of the other 9 bursts observed from the source by
RXTE during 1996 and 1998 did. No comparable oscillations were detected in the
other bursts. A pair of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) has been

4U 1916-053 is the first example of a source where the burst oscillation

We explore two specific scenarios. In one, inflation is temporarily ended
because a portion of the potential is too steep to support inflation. We find
that perturbations on super-horizon scales can be modified, usually leading to
a large amplification, because of entropy perturbations in the scalar field.
This leads to a broad feature in the power spectrum, and the slow-roll and
Stewart--Lyth approximations, which assume the perturbations reach an
asymptotic regime well outside the horizon, can fail by many orders of

  at http://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/~kawata/research/papers.html",,"10.1086/318991",,"astro-ph",,"  We reveal the role of clustering of sub-clumps, which is expected in the cold
dark matter (CDM) universe, in forming a bright elliptical galaxy (BEG) from a
low-spin seed galaxy.
  This can be done by comparing the evolution of a low-spin seed galaxy
including small-scale density fluctuations expected in the CDM universe
  (Model 1) with that of a completely uniform one (Model 2), using numerical
experiments.
  We show that Model 2 cannot reproduce the properties of BEGs and forms a disk
which is too compact and too bright due to the conservation of the
initial-small angular momentum.
  In Model 1 clustering of the sub-clumps caused by initial small-scale density
fluctuations leads to angular momentum transfer from the baryon component to
the dark matter and consequently a nearly spherical system supported by random
motions is formed.
  Moreover the collisionless property of the stars formed in the sub-clumps
prevents the dissipative contraction of the system, leading to a large measured
half-light radius.
  As a result, the end-product is quite well reproduces the observed properties
of BEGs, such as the de Vaucouleurs light-profile, typical color and
metallicity gradients, the large half-light radius, the small ratio of the
rotational velocity to the velocity dispersion (V/\sigma). We conclude that the
clustering of sub-clumps, i.e., the hierarchical clustering, plays a crucial
role in the formation of BEGs from a low-spin seed galaxy.

supernova remnants (SNRs), G337.2-0.7 and G309.2-0.6. Both remnants exhibit
line-rich thermal spectra that require highly non-solar elemental abundance
ratios. In each case, Si and S are unequivocally overabundant compared to solar
based purely on the measured equivalent width of the K$\alpha$ line complex.
Detailed nonequilibrium ionization spectral analysis of these remnants, using a
single temperature, single ionization age model, confirm the overabundances,
yielding Si, S and Ar abundances many times their solar values: 3 to 5 times
solar for G337.2-0.7 and greater than 3 to 10 times solar for G309.2-0.6. We
also find that for both remnants, Ne and Mg are underabundant relative to Si,
and for G309.2-0.6, Ca and Fe as well are relatively underabundant. This is the
first detection of metal-rich, non-solar abundance material in these remnants,
identifying them as young ejecta-dominated SNRs. Further support for their
youth comes from the distances that we estimate from the fitted column
densities (less than 15 kpc for G337.2-0.7, and $4 \pm 2$ kpc for G309.2-0.6).

young ages (2000 to 4500 years for G337.2-0.7, and 700 to 4000 years for
G309.2-0.6). Finally we note that no compact object has yet been found within

estimation for galaxies and quasars in a unified approach. For the redshift
estimation, we use an advanced version of the MEV estimator which determines
the redshift error from the redshift dependent probability density function.
  The method was originally developed for the CADIS survey, where we checked
its performance by spectroscopy. The method provides high reliability (6 errors
among 151 objects with R<24), especially for quasar selection, and redshifts
accurate within sigma ~ 0.03 for galaxies and sigma ~ 0.1 for quasars.

by Monte-Carlo simulations as well as by analytic evaluation in terms of
classification and redshift estimation. In practice, medium-band surveys show
superior performance. Finally, we discuss the relevance of color calibration

filters. The calibration accuracy poses strong constraints on an accurate
classification, and is most critical for surveys with few, broad and deeply
exposed filters, but less severe for many, narrow and less deep filters.

the largest drawdowns are occurring with a significantly larger rate than

genuine outliers. This is confirmed by extensive testing on surrogate data,

  At a much larger field $ B \sim B_*$, orbital effects induce the reversed
transition from the Singlet to the Triplet state. We study the newly proposed
Kondo behavior at this point. Here the Zeeman spin splitting cannot be
neglected, what changes the nature of the Kondo coupling. On grounds of exact
diagonalization results in a dot with cylindrical symmetry, we show that, at
odds with what happens at the other crossing point, close to $B_*$, orbital and
spin degrees of freedom are ``locked together'', so that the Kondo coupling
involves a fictitious spin 1/2 only, which is fully compensated by conduction
electrons under suitable conditions. In this sense, spin at the dot is
fractionalized. We derive the scaling equation of the system by means of a
nonperturbative variational approach. The approach is extended to the $B \neq

  Grinberg, 16 June 2000, St.Petersburg, Russia",,,,"gr-qc",,"  We describe the dynamics of a cosmological term in the spherically symmetric
case by an r-dependent second rank symmetric tensor \Lambda_{\mu\nu} invariant
under boosts in the radial direction. The cosmological tensor \Lambda_{\mu\nu}
represents the extension of the Einstein cosmological term \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}
which allows a cosmological constant be variable. This possibility is based on
the Petrov classification scheme and Einstein field equations in the
spherically symmetric case. The inflationary equation of state is satisfied by
the radial pressure p_r^{\Lambda}=-\rho^{\Lambda}. The tangential pressure is
calculated from the conservation equation \Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu;\mu}=0. The
solutions to the Einstein equations with cosmological term \Lambda_{\mu\nu}
describe several types of globally regular self-gravitating vacuum
configurations including vacuum nonsingular black holes. In this case the
global structure of space-time contains an infinite set of black and white
holes whose singularities are replaced with the value of cosmological constant
of the scale of symmetry restoration, at the background of asymptotically flat
or asymptotically de Sitter universes. We outline \Lambda white hole geometry
and estimate probability of quantum birth of baby universes inside a \Lambda
black hole. In the course of Hawking evaporation of a \Lambda black hole, a
second-order phase transition occurs, and globally regular configuration
evolves towards a self-gravitating particlelike structure at the background of
the Minkowski or de Sitter space.

are nonsingular as immersed 3-submanifolds, and diffeomorphic to R^3 or S^1 x
R^2. Some of the 3-folds are singular, and we describe their singularities,
which we believe are of a new kind.
  We hope these 3-folds will be helpful in understanding singularities of
compact special Lagrangian 3-folds in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. This will be
important in resolving the SYZ conjecture in Mirror Symmetry.

that are used to synthesize amino acids from the genetic information of nucleic
acids. We propose the following theory: the differentiation of physiological
states of a cell allows for the different choice of enzymes, and this choice is
later fixed genetically through evolution. To demonstrate this theory, a
dynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites,
enzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA-amino acid complex in a cell is
introduced and numerically studied. It is shown that the biochemical states of
cells are differentiated by cell-cell interaction, and each differentiated type
takes to use different synthetase. Through the mutation of genes, this
difference in the genetic code is amplified and stabilized. Relevance of this
theory to the evolution of non-universal genetic code in mitochondria is
suggested.
  The present theory for the evolution of genetic code is based on our recent
theory of isologous symbiotic speciation, which is briefly reviewed. According
to the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct
types through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have
identical genotypes, and later with the mutation in genotype, the genotype also
differentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the `symbiotic'
relationship between the types. Relevance of the theory to natural as well as
artificial evolution is discussed.

The approximations made in the models are not identical and lead to different
advantages and disadvantages. We notice that the dieletric model is able to
handle screening in a selfconsistent manner, but is limited to first order in
the electron-ion interaction. The ballistic model calculates the electron-ion
collision exactly in each order of the interaction, but has to introduce a
cut-off to incorporate screening effects. This means in the context of kinetic
theory that the electron-ion correlation has to be calculated either in random
phase or in ladder approximation, or, in other words, the linearized
Lenard-Balescu or Boltzmann collision term has to be used.
