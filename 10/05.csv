$\sim 15\mu$K and a GSC angular power spectrum above that of the white noise
for multipoles $\ell \lsim 10$ albeit smaller than that of CMB anisotropies by
a factor larger than $\sim 10$. Although the GSC is largest at low Galactic
latitudes, the contamination produced by far pattern features at medium and
high Galactic latitudes, peaking at $\sim 4\mu$K, has to be carefully
investigated, because the combination of low amplitude of Galaxy emission in
those regions with the extremely good nominal {\sc Planck} sensitivity
naturally makes high Galactic latitude areas the targets for unprecedentedly
precise estimation of cosmological CMB anisotropy.

atmosphere specific intensities, in particular the NEXTGEN model atmosphere
grid for cool giants (T_eff <= 6800 K and log(g) <= 3.5, Hauschildt et al.
1999). We point out that these models (computed using spherical geometry)
predict a limb darkening behaviour that deviates significantly from a simple
linear or two-parameter law (there is less intensity at the limb of the star).
The presence of a significantly nonlinear limb darkening law has two main
consequences. First, the ellipsoidal light curve computed for a tidally
distorted giant using the NEXTGEN intensities is in general different from the
light curve computed using the same geometry but with the black body
approximation and a one- or two-parameter limb darkening law. In most cases the
light curves computed with the NEXTGEN intensities have deeper minima than
their black body counterparts. Thus the light curve solutions for binaries with
a giant component obtained with models with near linear limb darkening (either
black body or plane-parallel model atmosphere intensities) are biased.
Observations over a wide wavelength range (i.e. both the optical and infrared)
are particularly useful in discriminating between models with nearly linear
limb darkening and the NEXTGEN models. Second, we show that rotational
broadening kernels for Roche lobe filling (or nearly filling) giants can be
significantly different from analytic kernels due to a combination of the
nonspherical shape of the star and the radical departure from a simple limb
darkening law. As a result, geometrical information inferred from V_rot*sin(i)
measurements of cool giants in binary systems are likewise biased.

selfconsistent description of the integrated system ``the physical object (the
Universe) + observation means'', observation means being represented by a
reference frame. The Lambda term appears in classical equations under certain
gauge conditions and characterizes the state of gravitational vacuum related to
a chosen reference frame. The eigenvalue spectrum of Lambda depends on a
concrete cosmological model and can be found by solving the Schrodinger
equation for a wave function of the Universe. The proposed version of quantum
geometrodynamics enables one to make predictions concerning probable values of

on the Einstein-Langevin equation similar to the expectation value of the
stress-energy tensor in semiclassical gravity based on the semiclassical
Einstein equation. According to the stochastic gravity program, this two point
function (and by extension the higher order correlations in a hierarchy) of the
stress energy tensor possesses precious statistical mechanical information of
quantum fields in curved spacetime and, by the self-consistency required of
Einstein's equation, provides a probe into the coherence properties of the
gravity sector (as measured by the higher order correlation functions of
gravitons) and the quantum nature of spacetime. It reflects the low and medium
energy (referring to Planck energy as high energy) behavior of any viable
theory of quantum gravity, including string theory. It is also useful for
calculating quantum fluctuations of fields in modern theories of structure
formation and for backreaction problems in cosmological and black holes
spacetimes.
  We discuss the properties of this bi-tensor with the method of
point-separation, and derive a regularized expression of the noise-kernel for a
scalar field in general curved spacetimes. One collorary of our finding is that
for a massless conformal field the trace of the noise kernel identically
vanishes. We outline how the general framework and results derived here can be
used for the calculation of noise kernels for Robertson-Walker and

the existence of stable static multi-center solutions, at least in ungauged

brane physics, including the construction of intersecting branes and reduced
symmetry D-brane configurations corresponding to the Coulomb branch of the
gauge theory. However the search for multi-center solutions to gauged
supergravities has proven rather elusive. Because of the background curvature,
it appears such solutions cannot be static. Nevertheless even allowing for time
dependence, general multi-center solutions to gauged supergravity have yet to
be constructed. In this letter we investigate the construction of such
solutions for the case of D=5, N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary
number of vector multiplets. Formally, we find a family of time dependent
multi-center black hole solutions which are easily generalized to the case of
AdS supergravities in general dimensions. While these are not true solutions,
as they have a complex metric and gauge potential, they may be related to a
Wick rotated theory or to a theory where the coupling is taken to be imaginary.
These solutions thus provide a partial realization of true multi-center

from a point view of string field theory. As in the commutative case it is
inevitable to introduce a closed string, which may be described as a bound

interacting nontrivially with the open string, plays an essential role in the
ultraviolet region. The contribution of the closed string is responsible for
the discrepancy between the NCFT and the string field theory. It clarifies the
controversial issues associated with the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) behaviour
of the perturbative dynamics of the NCFT.

to a slowly varying electrostatic potential. We establish that over

electron is governed by an effective one-particle Hamiltonian. In the proof
only a few generic properties of the full Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian H_PF enter.
Most importantly, H_PF must have an isolated ground state band for |p| < p_c <=
\infty with p the total momentum and p_c indicating that the ground state band
may terminate. This structure demands a local approximation theorem, in the
sense that the one- particle approximation holds until the semi-classical
dynamics violates |p|<p_c. Within this framework we prove an abstract Hilbert
space theorem which uses no additional information on the Hamiltonian away from
the band of interest. Our result is applicable to other time-dependent
semi-classical problems. We discuss semi-classical distributions for the

\Gamma belongs to a certain class of metabelian groups. Key to this approach is
the stratification of the character variety by the jumping loci of the

  657 nm with a Kerr-lens mode-locked femtosecond laser","4 pages, 2 ps-figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.63.021802",,"physics.optics",,"  The frequency of the Calcium ^3P_1--^1S_0 intercombination line at 657 nm is
phase-coherently measured in terms of the output of a primary cesium frequency
standard using an optical frequency comb generator comprising a sub-10 fs
Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and an external microstructure fiber
for self-phase-modulation. The measured frequency of \nu_Ca = 455 986 240 494
276 Hz agrees within its relative uncertainty of 4 10^-13 with the values
previously measured with a conceptually different harmonic frequency chain and
with the value recommended for the realization of the SI unit of length.

Souto Ribeiro","A Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for a Two-Photon Wave Packet","Submmited for publication in Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.63.023801",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose an experiment that permits observation of the de Broglie
two-photon wave packet behavior for a pair of photons, using a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. It is based on the use of pulsed lasers to generate pairs of
photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the post-selection of
events. It differs from previous realizations by the use of a third
time-correlated photon to engineer the state of the photons. The same technique
can give us which-path information via an ``interaction-free'' experiment and
can be used in other experiments on the foundations of quantum mechanics
related to wave-particle duality and to nonlocality.

(probe) clock transition which is monitored by using the quantum jump
technique. For a weak clock laser we obtain the well known Autler-Townes
splitting. For stronger powers of the clock laser we demonstrate the transition
to a new regime. The two regimes are distinguished by the transition of two
complex eigenvalues to purely imaginary ones which can be very different in
magnitude. The transition is controlled by the power of the clock laser. For
pump on resonance we present simple analytical expressions for various
linewidths and line positions.

- $^{3}P_{0}$ transition with a methane-stabilized He-Ne laser at 3.39 $\mu$m
which was calibrated against an atomic cesium fountain clock. A frequency gap
of 37 THz at the fourth harmonic of the He-Ne standard was bridged by a
frequency comb generated by a mode-locked femtosecond laser. The frequency of
the In$^{+}$ clock transition was found to be $1 267 402 452 899.92 (0.23)$
kHz, the accuracy being limited by the uncertainty of the He-Ne laser
reference. This represents an improvement in accuracy of more than 2 orders of
magnitude on previous measurements of the line and now stands as the most
accurate measurement of an optical transition in a single ion.
