the asymmetric photon-stimulated ejection of particles. These forces act in
addition to the ``radiation pressure'' due to absorption and scattering. Here
we model the forces due to photoelectron emission and the photodesorption of

to grain charging. We find that it is comparable to the radiation pressure when
the grain potential is relatively low and the radiation spectrum is relatively
hard. The calculation of the ``photodesorption'' force is highly uncertain,
since the surface physics and chemsitry of grain materials are poorly
understood at present. For our simple yet plausible model, the photodesorption
force dominates the radiation pressure for grains with size >~0.1 micron
exposed to starlight from OB stars. We find that the anisotropy of the
interstellar radiation field is ~10% in the visible and ultraviolet. We
estimate size-dependent drift speeds for grains in the cold and warm neutral

reassessment of the origin of the light elements in the early Galaxy. At low it
is metallicity ([O/H] < -1.75), it is necessary to introduce a production
mechanism which is independent of the interstellar metallicity (primary). At
higher metallicities, existing data might indicate that secondary production is
dominant. In this paper, we focus on the secondary process, related to the
standard Galactic cosmic rays, and we examine the cosmic ray energy
requirements for both present and past epochs. We find the power input to
maintain the present-day Galactic cosmic ray flux is about 1.5e41 erg/s = 5e50
erg/century. This implies that, if supernovae are the sites of cosmic ray
acceleration, the fraction of explosion energy going to accelerated particles
is about 30%, a value which we obtain consistently both from considering the
present cosmic ray flux and confinement and from the present 9Be and 6Li
abundances. Using the abundances of 9Be (and 6Li) in metal-poor halo stars, we
extend the analysis to show the effect of the interstellar gas mass on the
standard galactic cosmic ray energetic constraints on models of Li, Be, and B
evolution. The efficiency of the beryllium production per erg may be enhanced
in the past by a factor of about 10; thus the energetic requirement by itself
cannot be used to rule out a secondary origin of light elements. Only a clear
and undisputable observational determination of the O-Fe relation in the halo
will discriminate between the two processes. (abridged)

$0.124\pm0.011$ % per yr, which, when combined with the known age of the
remnant, determines the mean expansion parameter $m$, defined as $R\propto
t^m$, to be $0.54\pm0.05$. There are significant radial and azimuthal
variations of the X-ray expansion rate. The radial expansion in particular
shows highly significant evidence for the more rapid expansion of the forward
blast wave as compared to the reverse-shocked ejecta, an effect that has not
been seen previously. The expansion parameter varies from $m=0.71\pm0.06$ at
the outermost edge of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) to a value of
$m=0.34\pm0.10$ on the inside edge of the bright rim of emission. These values
are consistent with the rates expected for a remnant with constant density
ejecta evolving into a uniform interstellar medium during the ejecta-dominated
phase of evolution. Based on the size, age, and X-ray expansion rates, I obtain
values for the explosion energy and ambient density of $E\approx 4-5\times

for Cas A and Kepler's SNR, the X-ray expansion rate of Tycho's SNR appears to

with SN1998bw and is also a standard canonical (long; ~seconds) gamma-ray
burst. Herein it is argued that if gamma-ray bursts are relativistic jets with
the fastest moving material at the core, then the range of observed jet
inclinations to the line-of-sight produces a range in the observed properties
of GRBs, i.e. the lag-luminosity relationship. In particular, if the jet
inclination is high enough, the observed emitter will move slowly enough to
render relativistic beaming ineffective, thus distinguishing the jet from
apparent isotropic emission. Thus we expect a break in the lag-luminosity
relationship. I propose that GRB980425 defines that break. The position of this
break gives important physical parameters such as the Lorentz factor
(\gamma_max ~ 1000), the jet opening angle (~1 degree), and thus the beaming
fraction (~10^-4). Estimates of burst rates are consistent with observation. If
correct, this model is evidence in favor of the collapsar mode as the
progenitor of cosmological, long gamma-ray bursts.

sampled CO(1-0) observations at the NRAO 12m telescope. Our observations show
that the molecular gas peaks predominately in the disk-disk overlap region
between the nuclei, similar to the far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR)
emission. The bulk of the molecular gas is forming into stars with a normal
star formation efficiency (SFE) L_{IR}/M(H_2) \approx 4.2 Lsun/Msun, same as
that of giant molecular clouds in the Galactic disk. Additional supportive
evidence is the extremely low fraction of the dense molecular gas in Arp~244,
revealed by our detections of the HCN(1-0) emission.
  We estimate the local SFE indicated by the ratio map of the radio continuum
to CO(1-0) emission. Remarkably, the local SFE stays roughly same over the bulk
of the molecular gas distribution. Only some localized regions show the highest
radio-to-CO ratios that we have identified as the sites of the most intense
starbursts with SFE >~ 20 Lsun/Msun. These starburst regions are confined
exclusively in the dusty patches seen in the HST images near the CO and FIR
peaks where presumably the violent starbursts are heavily obscured.
Nevertheless, recent large-scale star formation is going on throughout the
system, yet the measured level is more suggestive of a moderate starburst (SFE
>~ 10 Lsun/Msun) or a weak to normal star formation (SFE ~ 4 Lsun/Msun). The
overall starburst from the bulk of the molecular gas is yet to be initiated as

the two classes, as for colours, redshift distributions and ages of the
dominant stellar populations. This sample appears to miss significantly
galaxies above z=1.4 (in a similar way as an early-type galaxy sample
previously studied by us), a fact which may be explained as a global decline of
the underlying mass function for galaxies at these high redshifts. Differences
between early and late-types are apparent -particularly in the colour
distributions and the evolutionary star-formation (SF) rates per unit volume-,
although the complication in spectro-photometric modelling introduced by
dust-extinction in the gas-rich systems prevents us to reach conclusive results

comoving star-formation rate density (SFR(t)) as a function of redshift is much
less affected by these uncertainties: by combining this with the previously

the ``Schwarzschild scenario''. This scenario relates the temporal evolution of

lifted from the disk or that the underlying galactic disk is contributing
slightly to this component. A single outflow component is detected in the NW
cone. The most likely energy source for this outflow is a hot bipolar thermal
wind powered on sub-kpc scale by the AGN and diverted along the galaxy minor
axis by the pressure gradient of the ISM in the host galaxy. The data are not
consistent with a starburst-driven wind or a collimated outflow powered by

the faint SCUBA sources are not in fact high redshift galaxies, but actually
local cold dark dusty gas clouds emitting only in the submm, with a temperature
around 7K. I show that the observational constraints on such a population -
dynamical limits on missing matter, the FIR-mm background, and the absence of
gross high-latitude extinction features - constrains the mass of such objects
to be in the range 0.1 - 10 Jupiter masses. The characteristics deduced are
closely similar to those of the objects proposed by Walker and Wardle (1998) to
explain halo dark matter. However, such objects, if they explain a large
fraction of the SCUBA sources, cannot extend through the halo without greatly
exceeding the FIR-mm background. Instead, I deduce the characteristic distance
of the SCUBA sources to be around 100 pc, consistent with being drawn from a
disk population with a scale height of few hundred parsecs. Regardless of the
dark matter problem, the possible existence of such compact sub-stellar but
non-degenerate objects is intriguing. They may be seen as ""failed stars"",
representing an alternative end-point to brown dwarfs. It is possible that they
greatly outnumber both stars and brown dwarfs. The nearest such object could be
a fraction of a parsec away. Several relatively simple observations could
critically test this hypothesis.

regions of one phase surrounded by the other in the case in which the scale of
the inhomogeneities is much larger than the interparticle distance. Two
geometries are studied in detail: spherical drops of one phase into the other
and a layered structure of one phase alternating with the other. We find the
optimum density profile in an approximation in which the free energy is a
functional of the local density (LDA). It is shown that an approximation in
which the density is assumed to be uniform (UDA) within each phase region gives
results very similar to those of the more involved LDA approach. Within the UDA
we derive the general equations for the chemical potential and the pressures of
each phase which generalize the Maxwell construction to this situation. The
equations are valid for a rather arbitrary geometry. We find that the
transition to the mixed state is quite abrupt i.e. inhomogeneities of the first
phase appear with a finite value of the radius and of the phase volume
fraction. The maximum size of the inhomogeneities is found to be on the scale
of a few electric field screening lengths. Contrary to the ordinary Maxwell
construction, the inverse specific volume of each phase depends here on the
global density in the coexistence region and can decrease as the global density
increases. The range of densities in which coexistence is observed shrinks as
the LRC interaction increases until it reduces to a singular point. We argue
that close to this singular point the system undergoes a lattice instability as
long as the inverse lattice compressibility is finite.

near-critical steady state characterized by a temperature gradient, the theory
predicts strong nonequilibrium fluctuations at very large length scales. Close
to the critical point, this results in a nonlinear regime of heat conductivity.
A transient non-equilibrium state triggered by a rapid and large spatially
uniform perturbation of the critical liquid is considered. A step away from
criticality generates a free field with strong and decaying correlations in
initial state, while a step towards criticality initiates the increase of
fluctuations and of their correlation at the large scale edge of the critical
range. The approach to equilibrium is characterized by an equilibration length
\Lambda_eq that depends on time t. The theory predicts a power law approach of
the temperature to the new equilibrium; the new critical exponents depend on
whether the temperature is initially increased or decreased.

our lattice results to physical units using the scale set by the static quark

in general for finite-component Wightman fields by Bisognano and Wichmann.
While this result incorporates most of the fields occurring in four-dimensional
high-energy physics, there still are field theories of interest that are not
covered (e.g., low-dimensional anyon fields and infinite-component fields).
  From the spectrum condition, Borchers has derived a couple of commutation
relations which 'almost, but only almost' imply the Unruh effect and
PCT-symmetry. We show that this result does imply the Unruh effect and
PCT-symmetry provided that the operators involved in Borchers' commutation
relations act geometrically on a local net of observables.

  Continuous Variable Quadrature Phase Amplitude Measurements","9 pages,4 figures, previously published","Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80},3169 (1998)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3169",,"quant-ph",,"  We demonstrate a contradiction of quantum mechanics with local hidden
variable theories for continuous variable quadrature phase amplitude
(``position'' and ``momentum'') measurements, by way of a violation of a Bell
inequality. For any quantum state, this contradiction is lost for situations
where the quadrature phase amplitude results are always macroscopically
distinct. We show that for optical realisations of this experiment, where one
uses homodyne detection techniques to perform the quadrature phase amplitude
measurement, one has an amplification prior to detection, so that macroscopic
fields are incident on photodiode detectors. The high efficiencies of such
detectors may open a way for a loophole-free test of local hidden variable
theories.

A, 60, 5074 (1999)","10.1103/PhysRevA.60.5074",,"quant-ph",,"  The intensity transverse profile of the light produced in the process of
stimulated down-conversion is derived. A quantum-mechanical treatment is used.
We show that the angular spectrum of the pump laser can be transferred to the
stimulated down-converted beam, so that images can also be transferred from the
pump to the down-converted beam. We also show that the transfer can occur from
the stimulating beam to the down-converted one. Finally, we study the process
of diffraction through an arbitrarily shaped screen. For the special case of a
double-slit, the interference pattern is explicitly obtained. The visibility
for the spontaneous emitted light is in accordance with the van Cittert -
Zernike theorem for incoherent light, while the visibility for the stimulated
emitted light is unity. The overall visibility is in accordance with previous
experimental results.
