effect for the sample, but only when radii larger than 0.5$r_{200}$ are
considered. We perform a principal component analysis of galaxy spectra to
divide the total cluster light into contributions from stellar populations of
different ages. Composite radial distributions of different stellar populations
show strong gradients as a function of cluster-centric radius. The composite
population is dominated by evolved populations in the core, and gradually
changes at radii greater than the virial radius to one which is similar to
coeval field galaxies. We do not see evidence at any radius within the clusters
for an excess of star formation over that seen in the coeval field. Within this
redshift range, significant evolution in the fractional population gradient is
seen. Both low and high redshift clusters have similar populations in the
cluster cores, but higher redshift clusters have steeper gradients and more
star forming galaxies at radii outside of the core region~-- in effect, a
restatement of the Butcher-Oemler effect. Luminosity density profiles are
consistent with a scenario where this phenomenon is due to a decline over time
in the infall rate of field galaxies into clusters. Depending on how long
galaxies reside in clusters before their star formation rates are diminished,
this suggests a decrease in the infall into clusters of a factor of $\sim 3$
between $z > 0.8$ and $z \sim 0.5$. We also discuss alternative scenarios for

average over the parameter space, is axisymmetric and oblate in the inner

triaxiality T are T < 0.13 at 0.33 kpc and T = 0.08 +/- 0.07 at 3.5 kpc from
the center. The luminous short-to-long axis ratio c_L = 0.79 +0.05-0.1 inside
0.82 kpc, flattening to c_L = 0.66 +0.07-0.08 at 1.9 kpc. The results are
similar if the galaxy is assumed to rotate about its short axis. Estimates for
c_L are robust, but those for T are dependent on whether the internal rotation
field is disklike or spheroid-like. Short-axis inclinations between 30 and 50
degrees are preferred for nearly axisymmetric models; but triaxial models in
high inclination are also allowed, which can affect central black hole mass
estimates. The available constraints on orientation rule out the possibility
that the nuclear dust ring at R = 1.5"" is in a stable equilibrium in one of the
galaxy's principal planes. The ring is thus a decoupled nuclear component not
linked to the main body of the galaxy. It may be connected with ionized gas
that extends to larger radii, since the projected gas rotation axis is near the
minor axis of the ring. The gas and dust may both be part of a strongly warped
disk; however, if caused by differential precession, the warp will wind up on
itself in a few 10^7 years. The decoupling with the stellar component suggests
that the gas has an external origin, but no obvious source is present.

The analysis is largely differential, free from zero point and extinction
uncertainties. The main conclusion is that the distance scales resulting from
all four stellar distance indicators are fully consistent with each other.
Therefore the distance scale problem is not a problem resulting from different
distances yielded by distance indicators, but rather a problem of the proper
zero point of this common distance scale. All four stellar distance indicators
have to be treated as an ensemble, and any determination of the zero point for
one of them must predict reasonable luminosities of the others. This puts
strong constraints on many proposed calibrations of distance indicators. For
example, very bright calibrations of Cepheids or RR Lyr can practically be
ruled out. (Abridged).

associated with bubbles must on average grow with the mean market return r.
When r is larger than the discount rate r_delta, the distribution of returns of
the observable price, sum of the bubble component and of the fundamental price,
exhibits an intermediate tail with an exponent which can be larger than 1. This
regime r>r_delta corresponds to a generalization of the rational bubble model
in which the fundamental price is no more given by the discounted value of
future dividends. We explain how this is possible. Our model predicts that, the
higher is the market remuneration r above the discount rate, the larger is the

probe interlayer Josephson coupling in different regions of the vortex phase
diagram in layered superconductors. In the liquid phase, the high temperature
expansion with respect to the Josephson coupling connects the Josephson plasma
frequency with the phase correlation function. This function, in turn, is
directly related to the pair distribution function of the liquid. We develop a
recipe to extract the phase and density correlation functions from the
dependencies of the plasma resonance frequency $\omega_p({\bf B})$ and the $c$
axis conductivity $\sigma_c({\bf B}) $ on the {\it ab}-component of the
magnetic field at fixed {\it c} -component. Using Langevin dynamic simulations
of two-dimensional vortex arrays we calculate density and phase correlation
functions at different temperatures. Calculated phase correlations describe
very well the experimental angular dependence of the plasma resonance field. We
also demonstrate that in the case of weak damping in the liquid phase,
broadening of the JPR line is caused mainly by random Josephson coupling
arising from the density fluctuations of pancake vortices. In this case the JPR
line has a universal shape, which is determined only by parameters of the
superconductors and temperature.

solutions to this problem, and thus demonstrate that bound-state formation
occurs at a critical exchange coupling, J_c, that decreases to zero in the
limit of extreme hopping anisotropy t_y/t_x -> 0. This result should be
contrasted with J_c/t = 2 for either a one-dimensional chain, or a
two-dimensional plane with isotropic hopping. Most importantly, this behaviour
is found to be qualitatively similar to that of two electrons on the two-leg
ladder problem in the limit of t_interchain/t_intrachain -> 0. Using the latter

determining that the bound state corresponds to one electron moving along one

minimize the commonly used performance metric, word error rate (WER). We
describe a method for explicitly minimizing WER by extracting word hypotheses
with the highest posterior probabilities from word lattices. We change the
standard problem formulation by replacing global search over a large set of
sentence hypotheses with local search over a small set of word candidates. In
addition to improving the accuracy of the recognizer, our method produces a new
representation of the set of candidate hypotheses that specifies the sequence
of word-level confusions in a compact lattice format. We study the properties
of confusion networks and examine their use for other tasks, such as lattice
compression, word spotting, confidence annotation, and reevaluation of

masses, these effects are large for only the third generation of sleptons. We
construct mass combinations to isolate the effect of $f_{\nu}$ from mass
corrections already expected from tau Yukawa couplings. We then analyze the
size of these effects, assuming that the Super-Kamiokande data constrain 0.033
eV $\alt m_{\nu_{\tau}} \alt 0.1$ eV and that neutrino masses arise via a

needs to be measured with a precision of about 2-3% to measure the effect of
$f_{\nu}$ if the neutrino and top Yukawa couplings unify at the grand
unification scale. In a simple case study, we find a precision of only 6-10%

globally smooth if the initial data is smooth and has small norm in the
critical Sobolev space $\dot H^{n/2}$ in the high dimensional case $n \geq 5$.
A major difficulty, not present in the earlier results, is that the $\dot
H^{n/2}$ norm barely fails to control $L^\infty$, potentially causing a
logarithmic divergence in the nonlinearity; however, this can be overcome by
using co-ordinate frames adapted to the wave map by approximate parallel
transport. In the sequel of this paper we address the more interesting
two-dimensional case, which is energy-critical.

hydrodynamic modes which relax exponentially toward the equilibrium state. In
chaotic systems with two degrees of freedom, the fine scale structure of these
hydrodynamic modes is singular and fractal. We characterize them by their
Hausdorff dimension which is given in terms of Ruelle's topological pressure.
For long-wavelength modes, we derive a striking relation between the Hausdorff
dimension, the diffusion coefficient, and the positive Lyapunov exponent of the
system. This relation is tested numerically on two chaotic systems exhibiting
diffusion, both periodic Lorentz gases, one with hard repulsive forces, the
other with attractive, Yukawa forces. The agreement of the data with the theory
is excellent.

magnetic dipole(M1), electric dipole(E2), and Coulomb(C2) strengths of the
gamma N -> Delta transition are presented. It is found that the C2/M1 ratio
drops significantly with Q^2 and reaches about -13% at Q^2=4 (GeV/c)^2, while
the E2/M1 ratio remains close to the value \sim -3 % at the Q^2=0 photon point.
The determined M1 transition form factor drops faster than the usual dipole
form factor of the proton. We also find that the non-resonant interactions can
dress the gamma N -> Delta vertex to enhance strongly its strength at low Q^2,
but much less at high Q^2. Predictions are presented for future experimental
tests. Possible developments of the model are discussed.

high signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the
scattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially
separated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via
the fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube
contains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity difference between
the two measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the
scattered light from a common scattering region but with two different momentum
transfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency
proportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows
that both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser
Doppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and
local velocity in real time. The new technique will have various applications
in the general area of fluid dynamics.

implies that the course of time along the trajectory of motion of a particle in
the inertial reference frames moving relative to each other depends on the
state of motion of the particle under the influence of a force field. As is
seen from the results obtained, the ability to influence the course of time
represents one of the most fundamental properties of any material system
intrinsically inherent in it by the very nature of things, which manifests
itself when the system interacts with force fields. The inferences of the paper
are not based on the use of any hypotheses and strictly follow from
relativistic equations of motion. The dependence of the course of time upon the
behaviour of physical system is, thus, a direct consequence of causality
principle, relativity principle and the pseudoeuclidity of space-time. The
results obtained confirm the Kozyrev hypothesis that time has physical
properties and open up radically new opportunities for the efficient control of
physical processes. It is demonstrated with point particle that the change in
the course of time results in the appearance of an additional force acting on
the particle. A general conclusion is drawn on the basis of the theory advanced
that relativistic equations of motion for any kind of matter contain
information about the physical properties of time, which are, thus, of
dynamical nature.

serves its original purpose - is suggested. The main purpose of this paper is
to suggest to perform this experiment. The results of this experiment predicted
under the alternative assumptions that the CI - together with the above
connection of the state function with reality - or the ``many-worlds''
interpretation (MWI) is correct are shown to be identical. Only after a further
modification (called ``Extension step 2'') - the use of an ion isolated from
