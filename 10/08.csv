Earth has played a pivotal role for more than 50 years. The work has been
largely led by the groups from the University of Tasmania and the Australian
Antarctic Division and has involved the operation of neutron monitors and muon
telescopes from many sites. In this paper the achievements of the Australian
researchers are reviewed and future experiments are described. Particular
highlights include: the determination of cosmic ray modulation parameters; the
development of modelling techniques of Ground Level Enhancements; the
confirmation of the Tail-In and Loss-Cone Sidereal anisotropies; the Space Ship

results show that the H2 and PAH emission regions are morphologically similar,
existing as several clumps, all of which correspond to CO emission clumps and
dark optical features. The emission confirms the existence of photodissociation
regions (PDRs) on the surface of the clumps. By comparing the velocity range of
the CO emission with the optical appearance of the H2 and PAH emission, we
present a model of the Keyhole Nebula in which the most negative velocity
clumps are in front of the ionization region, the clumps at intermediate
velocities are in it, and those which have the least negative velocities are at
the far side. It may be that these clumps, which appear to have been swept up
from molecular gas by the stellar winds from eta Car, are now being over-run by
the ionization region and forming PDRs on their surfaces. These clumps comprise
the last remnants of the ambient molecular cloud around eta Car.

algebra. The proposed approach to combinatorial problems relies on the theory
of moment-angle complexes, currently being developed by the authors. The theory
centres around the construction that assigns to each simplicial complex $K$
with $m$ vertices a $T^m$-space $\zk$ with a special bigraded cellular
decomposition. In the framework of this theory, the well-known non-singular
toric varieties arise as orbit spaces of maximally free actions of subtori on
moment-angle complexes corresponding to simplicial spheres. We express
different invariants of simplicial complexes and related

tasks that are intractable with classical computer technology. While basic
principles of a quantum computer have been demonstrated in the laboratory,
scalability of these systems to a large number of qubits, essential for
practical applications such as the Shor algorithm, represents a formidable
challenge. Most of the current experiments are designed to implement sequences
of highly controlled interactions between selected particles (qubits), thereby
following models of a quantum computer as a (sequential) network of quantum
logic gates. Here we propose a different model of a scalable quantum computer.
In our model, the entire resource for the quantum computation is provided
initially in form of a specific entangled state (a so-called cluster state) of
a large number of qubits. Information is then written onto the cluster,
processed, and read out form the cluster by one-particle measurements only. The
entangled state of the cluster thus serves as a universal substrate for any
quantum computation. Cluster states can be created efficiently in any system
with a quantum Ising-type interaction (at very low temperatures) between
two-state particles in a lattice configuration.
