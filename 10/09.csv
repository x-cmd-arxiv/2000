1254-690 observed by the BeppoSAX satellite. We find that the X-ray dips are
not present during the BeppoSAX observation, in line with recent RXTE results.
The broad band (0.1-100 keV) energy spectrum is well fitted by a
three-component model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody with an inner
disk temperature of ~0.85 keV, a comptonized spectrum with an electron
temperature of ~2 keV, and a bremsstrahlung at a temperature of ~20 keV.
Adopting a distance of 10 kpc and taking into account a spectral hardening
factor of ~1.7 (because of electron scattering which modifies the blackbody
spectrum emitted by the disk) we estimated that the inner disk radius is
$R_{\rm in} \sqrt{\cos i} \sim 11$ km, where i is the inclination angle of the
system with respect to the line of sight. The comptonized component could
originate in a spherical corona or boundary layer, surrounding the neutron
star, with optical depth ~19. The bremsstrahlung emission, contributing ~4% of
the total luminosity, probably originates in an extended accretion disk corona
with radius $\sim 10^{10}$ cm. In this scenario we calculated that the optical
depth of this region is ~0.71 and its mean electron density is $N_e \sim 2.7
\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$. This last component might also be present in other
low mass X-ray binaries, but, because of its low intrinsic luminosity, it is
not easily observable. We also find an absorption edge at ~1.27 keV with an
optical depth of ~0.15. Its energy could correspond to the L-edge of Fe XVII,
or K-edge of Ne X or neutral Mg.

h^{-1} M_sun at redshift z=9 when they collapse from 2-sigma fluctuations) if
rapid cooling can take place, and a significant fraction of their baryonic mass
is converted into stars over a dynamical timescale. We study the evolution of
SN-driven bubbles as they blow out from subgalactic halos and propagate into
the intergalactic medium (IGM), and show that to lift the halo gas out of the
potential well the energy injection must continue at least until blow-away
occurs. The collective explosive output of about ten thousands SNe per halo at
these early epochs could pollute vast regions of intergalactic space to a mean
metallicity <Z>=Omega_Z/Omega_b>0.003 (comparable to the levels observed in the
Lyman-alpha forest at z=3) without much perturbing the IGM hydrodynamically,
i.e. producing large variations of the baryons relative to the dark matter. The
volume filling factor of the ejecta is higher than 20% if the star formation
efficiency is of order 10%. When the filling factor of the ejecta becomes
significant, enriched material will typically be at a higher adiabat than
expected from photoionization.

self-consistent emission model that includes particle acceleration we show that
according to this scaling, in weak sources like MKN 421, the inverse Compton
(IC) scattering losses are dominated by synchrotron-self Compton scattering
(SSC), while in powerful sources, like 3C 279, they are dominated by external
Compton (EC) scattering of BLR photons. In agreement with other workers, we
show that even in the powerful sources that are dominated by EC scattering, the
hard X-ray emission is due to SSC. Finally, we show that this scaling

of cold material. This is the first confirmation with modern instrumentation
that NGC3516 indeed undergoes phases of strong cold X-ray absorption. We

Kluwer, 2001",,"MPI-PhT/2000-38","cond-mat quant-ph",,"  A procedure for demonstrating quantum coherence and measuring decoherence
times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using ``adiabatic
inversion'' is discussed. One fluxoid state is smoothly transferred into the
other, like a spin reversing direction by following a slowly moving magnetic
field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external applied flux, and depends
on a well-defined quantum phase between the two macroscopic states. Varying the
speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence time permits one to move from
the quantum regime, where such a well-defined phase exists, to the classical
regime where it is lost and the inversion is inhibited. Thus observing whether
inversion has taken place or not as a function of sweep speed offers the
possibility of measuring the decoherence time. Estimates with some typical
SQUID parameters are presented and it appears that such a procedure should be
experimentally possible.
  The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that the
low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be long
compared to other time scales of the problem, including the readout time.
Applications to the ``quantum computer'', with the level system of the SQUID
playing the role of the qbit, are briefly examined.

One of them is associated with a tricritical point which probably exists in the
phase diagram of the model. The other one is determined by the dynamical
fermion mass generation in the compact QED_3, which is insufficiently
understood but of much interest by itself.

supergravity in the bulk can be reduced to a RG-flow equation for the dual
low-energy, strongly coupled and large N gauge theory on the boundary. This
result has been used to obtain interesting relations between the various terms
in the gravitational part of the boundary effective action, in particular the
term that affect the cosmological constant. It is found that once the
cosmological constant is cancelled in the UV theory, the RG-flow symmetry of
the boundary effective action automatically implies the existence of zero
cosmological constant solutions that extend all the way into the IR. Given the
standard (and well founded) contradiction between the RG-flow idea and the
observational evidence of a small cosmological constant, this is considered to
be an important progress, albeit incomplete, towards the final solution.
Motivated by this success, it would be interesting to see whether this
RG-stability extends outside the scope of strong 't Hooft coupling and large N
regime that are implicitly assumed in the de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the holographic RG-flow equations of the
boundary theory. In this paper, we address this question. Taking into account
the leading order corrections in the 1/N and $\alpha'/{R^2}$ parameters, we
derive new bulk/boundary relations, from which one can read all the local terms
in the boundary effective action. Next, we use the resulting constraints, to
examine whether the RG-stability of the cosmological constant extends to the
new coupling regime. It would be also interesting to use these constraints to
study the Randall-Sundrum scenario in this case.

the quaternions as though they were a commutative field. This is of interest
both for its own sake, and because it can be applied to develop an ""algebraic
geometry"" of noncompact hypercomplex manifolds.
  The basic building blocks of the theory are AH modules, which should be
thought of ""vector spaces"" over the quaternions. An AH-module is a left module
over the quaternions H, together with a real vector subspace. There are natural
concepts of linear map and tensor product of AH-modules, which have many of the
properties of linear maps and tensor products of vector spaces. However, the
definition of tensor product of AH-modules is strange and has some unexpected
properties.
  Let M be a hypercomplex manifold. Then there is a natural class of H-valued
""q-holomorphic functions"" on M, satisfying a quaternionic analogue of the
Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are analogues of holomorphic functions on
complex manifolds. The vector space of q-holomorphic functions A on M is an
AH-module.
  Now some pairs of q-holomorphic functions can be multiplied together to get
another q-holomorphic function, but other pairs cannot. So A has a kind of
partial algebra structure. It turns out that this structure can be very neatly
described using the quaternionic tensor product and AH-morphisms, and that A
has the structure of an ""H-algebra"", a quaternionic analogue of commutative
algebra.

with a target nucleus that is surrounded by other nuclei in a molecule, in

collision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are
strongly boosted by the environment. The effect originates from a chain of
preliminary three elastic collisions which transform the projectile-target
experiment into one with colliding beams. Firstly, the projectile-target pair
of nuclei undergo elastic scattering in which the projectile shares its energy
and momentum with the target nucleus. Then the projectile and target nuclei
collide with different heavy nuclei from the environment. These latter
collisions change the velocities of the target and projectile nuclei and set
them again on the collision course. Finally, the same pair of nuclei collide
inelastically, this time giving rise to the nuclear reaction. The increased
energy of the target nucleus increases the relative velocity up to sqrt 2
times, resulting in a drastic exponential increase of the probability to
penetrate the Coulomb barrier and therefore sharply increasing the likelihood
of the nuclear reaction. Applications to laser-induced fusion are discussed.

fusion of the two deuterons moving towards each other. This effectively
converts the fixed target process into a colliding beam reaction. In a simple
limiting case this reduces the negative penetrability exponent by a factor of
$\sqrt{2}$. We also discuss a contribution given by ``zero oscillations'' of a
bound target deuteron. The proposed mechanism is expected to be efficient in
compounds with target deuterons localized in the vicinity of heavy atoms.

function of nucleon numbers A and B could provide information on the dynamics
of nuclear interactions. In particular the models of anomalous J/psi
suppression by Blaizot and Ollitrault (BO) and by Kharzeev, Lourenco, Nardi and
Satz (KLNS) are based on different assumptions on the dynamics of nuclear
collisions and lead to different predictions of the dependence of the onset of
anomalous J/psi suppression on nucleon numbers of colliding nuclei. The data on
this onset as function of A and B could become a tool for the study of the
dynamics of nuclear collisions and bring further evidence on J/psi suppression
by new form of hadronic matter, possibly Quark-Gluon Plasma.
  In particular we propose to study J/\psi suppression in A+Pb interaction with
nucleon number of A between 58 and 73 or a bit higher.

density approximation with uniform grid representation in the three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate. Effects of the continuum are taken into account either
with a Green's function method or with a complex absorbing potential in a
real-time method. The two methods are applied to a negatively charged cluster
in the spherical jellium model and to some small molecules (silane, acetylene
and ethylene).

explicitly in the context of the model of Simon {\it et al.} [J. Mod. Opt. {\bf

the effects of the number of atoms on the quality of quantum cloning. We show
that the universality of the scheme can be maintained by choosing the cycling
field according to the input state of the qubit.
