ionization of the cold gas is still a widely open question. In our paper we
discuss the critical velocity effect as a possible explanation for the observed
H\alpha-emission. The critical velocity effect can yield a fast ionization of
cold gas if this neutral gas passes through a magnetized plasma under suitable
conditions. We show that for parameters that are typical for the Magellanic
Stream the critical velocity effect has to be considered as a possible
ionization source of high relevance.

model is constructed by abstracting mass to a 1 Msun red giant branch model up
to the moment at which the model begins to evolve bluewards. We find that
element diffusion introduces noticeable changes in the internal structure of
the star. In particular, models undergo three thermonuclear flashes instead of
one flash as we found with the standard treatment. This fact has a large impact
on the total mass fraction of hydrogen left in the star at entering the final
cooling track. As a result, at late stages of evolution models with diffusion
are characterized by a much smaller nuclear energy release, and they evolve
significantly faster compared to those found with the standard treatment.
  We find that models in which diffusion is considered predict evolutionary
ages for the white dwarf companion to the millisecond pulsar PSR B1855+09 in
good agreement with the spin-down age of the pulsar.

the connection of GRBs to star formation. We compare the observed offset
distribution with an exponential disk, a model for the location of collapsars.
The statistical comparison shows good agreement, with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

have been proposed as a possible explanation for the surprising orbital
properties of extrasolar planetary systems. In particular, dynamical
instabilities would seem to provide a natural mechanism for producing the
highly eccentric orbits seen in many systems. Here we present results from
numerical integrations for the dynamical evolution of planetary systems
containing two identical giant planets in nearly circular orbits very close to
the dynamical stability limit. We determine the statistical properties of the
three main types of systems resulting from the development of an instability:
systems containing one planet, following either a collision between the two
initial planets, or the ejection of one of them to infinity, and systems
containing two planets in a new, quasi-stable configuration. We discuss the
implications of our results for the formation and evolution of observed
extrasolar planetary systems. We conclude that the distributions of
eccentricities and semimajor axes for observed systems cannot be explained
easily by invoking dynamical interactions between two planets initially on
circular orbits. While highly eccentric orbits can be produced naturally by
these interactions, collisions between the two planets, which occur frequently
in the range of observed semimajor axes, would result in many more nearly
circular orbits than in the observed sample.

observations of these sources made with the IRAM-30m telescope. With the CO
data we derive H2 densities of 10e(3.5-4.0) cm-3 and H2 column densities of a
few 10e22 cm-2. We have corrected the H2 data for ~ 30 magnitudes of visual
extinction using a self-consistent method. In every source, we find that the H2
emission exhibits a large temperature gradient. The S(0) and S(1) lines trace
temperatures (T) of ~150 K while the S(4) and S(5) lines indicate temperatures
of ~ 600K. The warm H2 column density is typically ~1-2 x 10e22 cm-2, and is
predominantly gas with T=150 K. This is the first direct estimate of the total
column density of the warm molecular gas in the Galactic center region. These
warm H2 column densities represent a fraction of ~ 30 % of the gas traced by
the CO isotopes emission. The cooling by H2 in the warm component is comparable
to that by CO. Comparing our H2 and CO data with available ammonia NH3
observations from literature one obtains relatively high NH3 abundances of a
few 10e(-7) in both the warm and the cold gas. A single shock or
Photo-Dissociation Region (PDR) cannot explain all the observed H2 lines.
Alternatives for the heating mechanisms are discussed.

responsible for producing these objects took place in dust-enshrouded active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). If so, then measurements of the intensity of background
radiation and the source counts in the far-infrared and submillimetre wavebands
constrain the temperature of dust in these AGNs. An additional constraint comes
from the hard X-ray background, if this is produced by accretion. One
possibility is that the dust shrouds surrounding the accreting AGNs are cold,
about 30 K. In this event, the dusty AGNs could be some subset of the
population of luminous distant sources discovered at 850 microns using the
SCUBA array on the JCMT, as proposed by Almaini et al. (1999). An alternative
is that the dust shrouds surrounding the accreting AGNs are much hotter (> 60
K). These values are closer to the dust temperatures of a number of
well-studied low-redshift ultraluminous galaxies that are thought to derive
their power from accretion. If the local MDO density is close to the maximum
permitted, then cold sources cannot produce this density without the
submillimetre background being overproduced if they accrete at high radiative
efficiency, and thus a hot population is required. If the dust-enshrouded
accretion occurred at similar redshifts to that taking place in unobscured
optical quasars, then a significant fraction of the far-infrared background
radiation measured by COBE at 140 microns, but very little of the
submilllimetre background at 850 microns, may have been produced by hot
dust-enshrouded AGNs which may have already been seen in recent X-ray surveys.

reddening-corrected R-band magnitude of $m_R = 18.55\pm0.03$. Its spectrum

strength of the H-alpha emission would imply a star formation rate $\SFR

curved shaped of this object and its tangential orientation along the major
axis of the BCG suggest lensing. We model the A2152 core mass distribution
including the two BCG components and the cluster potential. We present velocity
and velocity dispersion profile measurements for the two BCG components and use
these to help constrain the potential. The lens modeling indicates a likely
magnification factor of $\sim1.9$ for the lensed galaxy, making A2152 the
nearest cluster in which such significant lensing of a background source has
been observed. Finally, we see evidence for a concentration of early-type
galaxies at $z=0.13$ near the centroid of the X-ray emission previously

NGC 891 there is also an increase of 5007/H-alpha with |z| that can only come
about if most of the ionizing radiation is supplied by stars with T~50000 K.
Either their radiation must propagate from the plane to high |z| through very
little intervening matter, or else the stars are located at high |z|. The total
power requirement of the extra heating is <15% of the photoionization power.
[O~II]3727/H-beta can serve as a useful diagnostic of extra heating, but
[S~III] 9065,9531/H-alpha is not useful in this regard.

model the resonant properties of a sphere. A specific frequency distribution of
resonances can be approximated, up to a certain frequency, by inserting an
allpass filter of moderate order after each delay line of a feedback delay
network. The structure used for rectangular boxes is therefore augmented with a
set of allpass filters allowing parametric control over the enclosure size and

phase of the incident gravitational waves. Correspondingly, the signals from
the different detectors can be combined, in the analysis, to simulate a single
detector of greater amplitude and directional sensitivity: in short, aperture
synthesis. Here we consider the problem of aperture synthesis in the special
case of a search for a source whose waveform is known in detail: \textit{e.g.,}
compact binary inspiral. We derive the likelihood function for joint output of
several detectors as a function of the parameters that describe the signal and
find the optimal matched filter for the detection of the known signal. Our
results allow for the presence of noise that is correlated between the several
detectors. While their derivation is specialized to the case of Gaussian noise
we show that the results obtained are, in fact, appropriate in a well-defined,
information-theoretic sense even when the noise is non-Gaussian in character.
  The analysis described here stands in distinction to ``coincidence
analyses'', wherein the data from each of several detectors is studied in
isolation to produce a list of candidate events, which are then compared to
search for coincidences that might indicate common origin in a gravitational
wave signal. We compare these two analyses --- optimal filtering and
coincidence --- in a series of numerical examples, showing that the optimal
filtering analysis always yields a greater detection efficiency for given false
alarm rate, even when the detector noise is strongly non-Gaussian.

the theory of characteristic classes. We have already remarked \cite{Crai} that
such connections up to homotopy can be used to compute the classical Chern
characters. Here we present a slightly different argument for this, and then
proceed with the discussion of the flat (secondary) characteristic classes. As
an application, we clarify the relation between the two different approaches to
characteristic classes of algebroids (and of Poisson manifolds in particular):
we explain that the intrinsic characteristic classes are precisely the
secondary classes of the adjoint representation.

\pi(x;q,b)$ is more likely to hold if $a$ is a non-square modulo $q$ and $b$ is
a square modulo $q$ (the so-called ``Chebyshev Bias''). For instance, each of
$\pi(x;8,3)$, $\pi(x;8,5)$, and $\pi(x;8,7)$ tends to be somewhat larger than
$\pi(x;8,1)$. However, it has come to light that the tendencies of these three
$\pi(x;8,a)$ to dominate $\pi(x;8,1)$ have different strengths. A related
phenomenon is that the six possible inequalities of the form $\pi(x;8,a_1) >
\pi(x;8,a_2) > \pi(x;8,a_3)$ with $\{a_1,a_2,a_3\}=\{3,5,7\}$ are not all
equally likely---some orderings are preferred over others. In this paper we
discuss these phenomena, focusing on the moduli $q=8$ and $q=12$, and we
explain why the observed asymmetries (as opposed to other possible asymmetries)
occur.

creating exotic matter. The energy arising between two nearly perfectly
conducting parallel plates is shown to become increasingly negative as the
plate separation is reduced. It is proposed that the Casimir energy appears
increasingly negative simply because the vacuum electromagnetic zero-point
field performs positive work in pushing the plates together, transforming field
energy into kinetic energy of the plates. Next, the inertial properties of
exotic matter are considered. The parallel plates of the Casimir system are
replaced with an enclosed cavity of identical dimensions that is subjected to
an external force. It is found that zero-point radiation exerts an inertial
force on the cavity in opposition to the external force. This ultimately leads
to the conclusion that the inertial properties of exotic matter are identical
to the inertial properties of ordinary matter.

states from $N$ copies of a bipartite quantum system about which only partial
information is known, for instance in the form of a given expectation value. We
point out that there is indeed a problem with applying the Jaynes principle of
maximum entropy to more than one copy of a system, but the nature of this
problem is classical and was discussed extensively by Jaynes. Under the
additional assumption that the state $\rho^{(N)}$ of the $N$ copies of the
quantum system is exchangeable, one can write down a simple general expression
for $\rho^{(N)}$. We show how to modify two standard entanglement purification
protocols, one-way hashing and recurrence, so that they can be applied to
exchangeable states. We thus give an explicit algorithm for distilling
entanglement from an unknown or partially known quantum state.
