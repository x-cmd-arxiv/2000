FWHM, the CIV emission line FWHM, and the radio core fraction. We find 17
associated NALs toward 15 QSOs, of which ~10 are statistically expected to be
intrinsic. From a multivariate clustering analysis, the QSOs seem to group
together based primarily on radio luminosity, followed by radio spectral index,
CIV emission line FWHM, and soft X-ray luminosity. Radio-loud QSOs which have
compact radio morphologies, flat radio spectra, and mediocre CIV FWHM (<6000
km/s) do not have detectable associated NALs, down to REW(CIV)=0.35 A. We find
that BALQSOs have an enhanced probability of hosting detectable NAL gas and
that the velocities of associated NALs are peaked around the emission
redshifts, rather than the systemic redshifts of the QSOs. There is only one
strong NAL [REW(CIV)>1.5 A] in our low redshift sample which implies evolution
in the number of strong NALs with redshift. We interpret these results in the
context of an accretion-disk model. In this framework, we suggest that the
observational clues result from differences in orientation and wind properties,
the latter presumably associated with the QSO radio properties. (abridged)

the outflows observed in CVs, if the net effect of these winds is to deliver
$10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$ of the mass transfer rate to the CB disk. The torque
exerted by the CB disk provides a positive feedback between mass transfer rate
and CB disk mass which can lead to mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-8}

variation of mass transfer rates in CV's. In particular, it may explain rates
inferred for the novalike variables and the supersoft X-ray binary systems

10697, has recently been shown to have a mass in the brown dwarf regime; we
find [Fe/H] $= +0.16$ for it. For the remaining sample, we derive [Fe/H]
estimates ranging from -0.41 to $+0.37$, with an average value of $+0.18 \pm
0.19$. If we add the 13 stars included in the previous papers of this series

recent studies of Santos et al., we derive $<$[Fe/H]$> = +0.17 \pm 0.20$.
  Among the youngest stars with planets with F or G0 spectral types, [Fe/H] is
systematically larger than young field stars of the same Galactocentric
distance by 0.15 to 0.20 dex. This confirms the recent finding of Laughlin that
the most massive stars with planets are systematically more metal rich than
field stars of the same mass. We interpret these trends as supporting a
scenario in which these stars accreted high-Z material after their convective
envelopes shrunk to near their present masses. Correcting these young star
metallicities by 0.15 dex still does not fully account for the difference in
mean metallicity between the field stars and the full parent stars sample.
  The stars with planets appear to have smaller [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe]
values than field dwarfs of the same [Fe/H]. They do not appear to have
significantly different values of [O/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], or [Ti/Fe], though.

described in Devriendt et al. (1999) are embedded within the explicit
cosmological framework of a simple semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and
evolution. We build a class of models which capture the luminosity budget of
the universe through faint galaxy counts and redshift distributions in the
whole wavelength range spanned by our spectra. In contrast with a rather stable
behaviour in the optical and even in the far-IR, the submm counts are
dramatically sensitive to variations in the cosmological parameters and changes
in the star formation history. Faint submm counts are more easily accommodated
within an open universe with a low value of $\Omega_0$, or a flat universe with
a non-zero cosmological constant. This study illustrates the implementation of
multi-wavelength spectra into a semi-analytic model. In spite of its
simplicity, it already provides fair fits of the current data of faint counts,
and a physically motivated way of interpolating and extrapolating these data to
other wavelengths and fainter flux levels.

differentially rotating stars in the first post-Newtonian approximation of
general relativity. We vary the compaction of the star $M/R$ (where $M$ is the
gravitational mass and $R$ the equatorial circumferential radius) between 0.01
and 0.05 to isolate the influence of relativistic gravitation on the
instability. For compactions in this moderate range, the critical value of
$\beta \equiv T/W$ for the onset of the dynamical instability (where $T$ is the
rotational kinetic energy and $W$ the gravitational binding energy) slightly
decreases from $\sim 0.26$ to $\sim 0.25$ with increasing compaction for our
choice of the differential rotational law. Combined with our earlier findings
based on simulations in full general relativity for stars with higher
compaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation {\em enhances} the
dynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in for
smaller values of $\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in Newtonian gravity. We
also find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbation
saturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, at
least for several rotational periods. To check the reliability of our numerical
integrations, we verify that the general relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz
circulation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass energy, total
mass-energy, linear and angular momentum. Conservation of circulation indicates
that our code is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. We determine
the amplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emitted

computed using high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations of the
Lambda-CDM model. Although the number fraction of subhalos of mass
$>2x10^{11}\hsolmass$ is only ~10%, we find that the interaction rate of such
subhalos is relatively high because they reside in high density environments.
At low redshift, the subhalo collisions dominate the total collision rate, and
even at z=3 they are involved in more than 30% of all collisions. About 40% of
the ""major"" mergers are between subhalos. Therefore subhalo interactions must
be incorporated in models of structure formation. We find that the collision
rate between halos in physical density units, is $\propto (1+z)^\delta $, with
$\delta = 3-4$, in agreement with earlier simulations and most observational
data. We test previous analytic estimates of the interaction rates of subhalos
based on statistical models, which could be very inaccurate because of the
small number of subhalos and the variation of conditions within small host
halos. We find that, while such statistical estimates may severely overestimate
the rate within hosts $< 10^{13} \hsolmass$, typical of high redshifts, they
are valid for larger hosts regardless of the number of subhalos in them. We
find the Makino & Hut (1997) estimate of the subhalo merger rate to be valid
for hosts $ > 6x10^{11}\hsolmass$ at all redshifts. The collision rate between
subhalos and the central object of their host halo is approximated relatively
well using the timescale for dynamical friction in circular orbits. This
approximation fails in ~40% of the cases, partly because of deviations from the
assumption of circular orbits and partly because of the invalidity of the
assumption that the subhalo mass is negligible.

position in the glass state and the reorientational correlators for
angular-momentum index $\ell = 1$ and $\ell = 2$ near the glass transition are
compared with those obtained previously within a theory based on a
tensor-density description of the molecule in order to demonstrate that the two
approaches yield equivalent results. For strongly hindered reorientational
motion, the dipole-relaxation spectra for the $\alpha$-process can be mapped on
the dielectric-loss spectra of glycerol if a rescaling is performed according
to a suggestion by Dixon et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 65}, 1108 (1990)]. It is
demonstrated that the glassy dynamics is independent of the molecule's inertia
parameters.

formation or smoothening. The driving force can be of quite different origin
such as a pulsed laser beam, an electric field, or elasticity. Depending on
driving conditions, step bunching and meandering, mound formation, or surface
smoothening may be seen in presence of a kinetic asymmetry at the steps or
kinks (the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect). We employ a step model to calculate the
induced mass flux along misoriented surfaces, which accounts for surface
dynamics and stability. Flux inversion is found when varying the driving
frequency. Slope selection and metastability result from the cancellation of
the mass flux along special orientations. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
illustrate these points.

oscillations of non-rotating, spherically symmetric neutron stars within the
framework of general relativity. We derive the appropriate equations using the
(3+1)-formalism. We first focus on the evolution of radial oscillations, which
do not emit gravitational waves. We demonstrate how to handle a numerical
instability that also occurs in the non-radial case, when the stellar model is
constructed based on a realistic equation of state. We devise a coordinate
transformation that not only removes this instability but also provides much
more accurate results. [...] The main part deals with the evolution of
non-radial oscillations (l >= 2) of neutron stars. Here, we compare different
formulations of the equations and discuss how they have to be numerically dealt
with in order to avoid instabilities at the origin. We present results for
various polytropic stellar models and different initial data. [...] In the last
part of this thesis we consider a physical mechanism for exciting oscillations
of neutron stars. We use the time dependent gravitational field of a small
point mass \mu that orbits the neutron star to induce stellar oscillations.
With this particle we have a physical means which removes the arbitrariness in
choosing the initial data. [...] By sampling various orbital parameters of the
particle we show that in general the particle is not able to excite any
w-modes. It is only for speeds very close to the speed of light that the w-mode
is a significant part of the wave signal.

configurations within Coulomb- and axial gauge is described. We present
evidence that compact variables generate confinement-like phenomena in both

that there is an inconsistency in the way that many calculations are

physics below some scale \mu, then one needs dimension eight operators
explicitly in the weak OPE. On the other hand if one wants to use dimensional
regularization throughout, then one needs all scales to be included within the
matrix element, and this results in the same net effect. A numerical estimate
indicates that this is important below \mu= 2 GeV, and this calls into question

the brane. At short distances the resulting propagator for the gauge field is
{\it identical} to the four-dimensional propagator. The gauge theory on the

higher-dimensional on very large (cosmic) scales. The brane-bulk system
exhibits the phenomenon of ``infrared transparency''. As a result, only very
low frequency modes can escape into extra dimensions. In this framework the
large wavelength cosmic radiation can dissipate in extra space at a rate that
may be observable, in principle. We briefly discuss some astrophysical
consequences of this scenario.

perturbative calculations of Recknagel et al, not only as a tool to predict the
IR endpoints of certain flows, but also as a motivation for considering the
particular limiting case of c = 1. By treating this limit, we are able to
investigate a wide class of perturbations by considering them as deformations
away from the c = 1 point. We also present the truncated conformal space
approach as a tool for investigating the space of RG flows and checking
particular predictions.

which correspond to multiple BTZ black holes. These solutions typically have
additional singularities, the simplest cases being special conical
singularities with a 2 pi surplus angle. There are solutions with singularities
inside a common outer horizon, and other solutions with naked conical
singularities. Previously such singularities have been ruled out on physical
grounds, because they do not obey the geodesic equation. We find however that
the Chern-Simons gauge symmetry may be used to locate all such singularities to
the horizons, where they necessarily follow geodesics. We are therefore led to
conclude that these singular solutions correspond to physically sensible
geometries.
  Boundary charges at infinity are only sensitive to the total mass and spin of
the black holes, and not to the distribution among the black holes. We
therefore argue that a holographic description in terms of a boundary conformal
field theory should represent both single and multiple BTZ solutions with the
same asymptotic charges. Then sectors with multiple black holes would
contribute to the black hole entropy calculated from a boundary CFT.

  It is shown that the monodromic strings naturally appear in T-dualizing

the ground state of the system with anisotropy parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$

representation of the ground state of the finite size XXZ spin chain in terms
of elementary functions, we concentrate on the crossing-parameter $\eta$
dependence around $\eta=\pi/3$ for which there is a known solution. The
approach taken involves the use of a physical solution $Q$ of Baxter's t-Q
equation, corresponding to the ground state, as well as a non-physical solution
$P$ of the same equation. The calculation of $P$ and then of the ground state
derivative is covered. Possible applications of this derivative to the theory
of percolation have yet to be investigated. As far as the finite XXZ spin chain
with periodic boundary conditions is concerned, we find a similar solution for
an assymetric case which corresponds to the 6-vertex model with a special
magnetic field. For this case we find the analytic value of the ``magnetic

bunching effect, which involves a trapping level. An analysis using
rate-equations for the populations of the N-V center levels shows the intensity
dependence of the rate equation coefficients.

Bose-Einstein condensate with 1/r attractive interactions: the analog of a Bose
star. Here we focus upon the conditions neccessary to observe the transition
from external trapping to self-binding. This transition becomes manifest in a
sharp reduction of the condensate radius and its dependence on the laser
intensity rather that the trap potential.

Lett. 86, 1370 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.1370",,"quant-ph",,"  We report a quantum teleportation experiment in which nonlinear interactions
are used for the Bell state measurements. The experimental results demonstrate
the working principle of irreversibly teleporting an unknown arbitrary quantum
state from one system to another distant system by disassembling into and then
later reconstructing from purely classical information and nonclassical EPR
correlations. The distinct feature of this experiment is that \emph{all} four
Bell states can be distinguished in the Bell state measurement. Teleportation
of a quantum state can thus occur with certainty in principle.
