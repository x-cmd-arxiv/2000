  The recent detection of Sgr A* in the X-ray band, together with the radio
polarization measurements conducted over the past few years, offer the best
constraints yet for understanding the nature of the emitting gas within several
Schwarzschild radii ($r_S$) of this supermassive black hole candidate at the
Galactic Center. Earlier, we showed that the sub-mm radiation from this source
may be associated with thermal synchrotron emission from an inner Keplerian
region within the circularization radius of the accreting plasma. In this
paper, we extend this analysis in a very important way, by calculating the
implied high-energy emission of Sgr A* associated with the orbiting, hot,
magnetized gas. We find that for the accretion rate inferred from the fits to
the sub-mm data, the dominant contribution to Sgr A*'s X-ray flux is due to
self-Comptonization of the radio photons, rather than from bremsstrahlung. The
latter is a two-body process, which would produce significant X-ray emission
only at much higher accretion rates. This picture leads to the testable
prediction that the physical conditions within the inner $\sim5r_S$ are
variable on a time scale of order a year. In particular, the accretion rate
$\dot M$ appears to have changed by about 15% between the sub-mm measurements
in 1996 and 1999. Given that the radio and self-Comptonized fluxes are strongly
correlated in this picture, the upcoming second generation Chandra observations
of Sgr A* may provide the direct evidence required to test this model.

McNamara $etal$, the large scale X-ray morphology of the cluster is fairly
smooth. A spectroscopic analysis of the ACIS data shows that the gas
temperature in Hydra A increases outward, reaches a maximum temperature of 4
keV at 200 kpc, and then decreases slightly at larger radii. The distribution
of heavy elements is nonuniform, with a factor of two increase in the Fe and Si
abundances within the central 100 kpc. Beyond the central 100 kpc the Si-to-Fe
abundance ratio is twice solar, while the Si-to-Fe ratio of the central excess
is consistent with the solar value. One of the more surprising results is the
lack of spectroscopic evidence for multiphase gas within the bulk of the
cooling flow. Beyond the central 30 kpc, the ACIS spectra are adequately fit
with a single temperature model. The addition of a cooling flow component does
not significantly improve the fit. Only within the central 30 kpc (where the
cooling time is less than 1~Gyr), is there spectroscopic evidence for
multiphase gas. However, the spectroscopic mass deposition rate is more than a
factor of 10 less than the morphologically derived mass accretion rate at 30
kpc. We propose that the cooling flow region is convectively unstable due to
heating by the central radio source which significantly reduces the net
accretion rate.

protostellar disks are examined. Earlier work on this topic focused on axial
field and perturbation wavenumbers. Here we treat the problem more generally.
Both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric cases are investigated. Though seldom
explicitly included in calculations, HEMFs appear to be important whenever
Ohmic dissipation is. They allow for the appearance of electron whistler waves,
and since these have right-handed polarization, a helicity factor is also
introduced into the stability problem. This factor is the product of the
components of the angular velocity and magnetic field along the perturbation
wavenumber, and it is destabilizing when negative. Unless the field and angular
velocity are exactly aligned, it is always possible to find destabilizing
wavenumbers. HEMFs can destabilize any differential rotation law, even those
with angular velocity increasing outward. Regardless of the sign of the angular
velocity gradient, the maximum growth rate is always given in magnitude by the
local Oort A value of the disk, as in the standard magnetorotational
instability. The role of Hall EMFs may prove crucial to understanding how
turbulence is maintained in the ``low state'' of eruptive disk systems.

J104459.6+365605. The line of sight towards the QSO contains two clusters of
outflowing clouds that give rise to broad blue shifted absorption lines. The
outflow velocities of the clouds range from -200 to -1200 km/s and from -3400
to -5200 km/s, respectively. The width of the individual absorption lines
ranges from 50 to more than 1000 km/s. The most prominent absorption lines are
those of Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. The low ionization absorption lines occur at
the same velocities as the most saturated Mg II lines, showing that the Fe II,
Mg I and Mg II line forming regions must be closely associated. Many absorption
lines from excited states of Fe II are present, allowing a determination of the
population of several low lying energy levels. From this we determine an
electron density in the Fe II line forming regions of 4000 per cubic cm.
Modelling the ionization state of the absorbing gas with this value of the
electron density as a constraint, we find that the distance between the Fe II
and Mg I line forming region and the continuum source is of order 700 parsec.
  From the correspondence in velocity between the Fe II, Mg I and Mg II lines
we infer that the Mg II lines must be formed at the same distance. The Mg II
absorption fulfills the criteria for Broad Absorption Lines defined by Weymann
et al. (1991). This large distance is surprising, since BALs are generally
thought to be formed in outflows at a much smaller distance from the nucleus.

the Lorentz factor of the jet is equal to the inverse of its initial
half-opening angle. (2) No obvious break appears at the time when the blast
wave transits from the relativistic to the non-relativistic phase. (3) For the
wind case, there is no flattening tendency even up to $10^9$ s. (4) Compared

sectors and how this is connected with the non-trivial dependence of the

We study two modifications of the minimal model in order to obtain the mass
scale relevant for atmospheric neutrino oscillations with at most O(1)
higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings and with M_{\ast} \sim a few TeV. 1) In
models with singlet fermions in smaller number of extra dimensions than
gravity, we find that the effects on BR (\mu \to e \gamma) and on
charged-current universality in \pi^- \to e \bar{\nu}, \mu \bar{\nu} decays are
suppressed as compared to that in the minimal model with neutrino and gravity

with lepton number violating couplings, then the mass scales and mixing angles
for neutrino oscillations can be different from those relevant for \mu \to e

the constraints on M_{\ast} from BR (\mu \to e \gamma) and \pi^- \to e

constraints from supernova 1987a strongly disfavor oscillations of active

objects are interpreted as hybrid mesons, in the quark-gluon constituent model
using a chromoharmonic confining potentiel.
  The quantum numbers $J^{PC}I^{G} = 1^{-+} 1^{-}$ can be considered in a
constituent model as an hybrid meson ($q \bar q g$). The lowest $J^{PC}=
1^{-+}$states may be built in two ways : $l_{g}$=1 (gluon-excited)
corresponding to an angular momentum between the gluon and ($q \bar q$) system,
while $l_{q \bar q}=1$ (quarks-excited) corresponds to an angular momentum
between $q$ and $\bar q$. For the gluon-excited mode $1^{-+}$ hybrids, we find
the decay dominated by the $b_{1}\pi$ channel, and by the $\rho \pi$ channel
for the quark-excited mode. In our model, neither the quark-excited nor the
gluon-excited $1^{-+}$ (1400 MeV) hybrids can decay into $\eta\pi$ and
$\eta'\pi$, in contradiction with experiment. Hence, the 1400 MeV resonance
seems unlikely to be an hybrid state. The $1^{-+}$ (1600 MeV) gluon-excited
hybrid is predicted with too large a total decay width, to be considered as an
hybrid candidate. On the contrary the quark-excited mode has a total decay
width around 165 MeV, with a $\rho \pi$ preferred decay channel, in agreement

constructing the Ricci-flat Kahler metric on resolved conifold and then solving
the supergravity equations for the D3-brane ansatz with constant dilaton and
(self-dual) 3-form fluxes; (ii) by generalizing the ``conifold'' ansatz of

describing radial evolution still admits a superpotential and then solving the
resulting 1-st order system. The superpotentials for the ``resolved'' and
``deformed'' conifold cases turn out to have essentially the same simple
structure. The solution in the resolved conifold case has the same asymptotic
UV behaviour as in the conifold case, but unlike the deformed conifold case is
still singular in the IR. The naked singularity is of repulson type and may
have a brane resolution.

applications to classical linear frame theory are indicated. As an application
we describe the nature of families of operators {S_i} such that SUM_i

we discuss some measures for pairs of frames to be close to one another. Most
of the measures are expressed in terms of norm-distances of different kinds of
frame operators. In particular, the existence and uniqueness of the closest
(normalized) tight frame to a given frame is investigated. For Riesz bases with
certain restrictions the set of closetst tight frames often contains a multiple
of its symmetric orthogonalization (i.e. L\""owdin orthogonalization).

psi_{n}(q) by classical periodic orbits to include situations where these
orbits undergo generic bifurcations. It is shown that |psi_{n}(q)|^{2},
averaged locally with respect to position q and the energy spectrum E_{n}, has
structure around bifurcating periodic orbits with an amplitude and length-scale
whose hbar-dependence is determined by the bifurcation in question.
Specifically, the amplitude scales as hbar^{alpha} and the length-scale as
hbar^{w}, and values of the scar exponents, alpha and w, are computed for a
variety of generic bifurcations. In each case, the scars are semiclassically
wider than those associated with isolated and unstable periodic orbits;
moreover, their amplitude is at least as large, and in most cases larger. In
this sense, bifurcations may be said to give rise to superscars. The
competition between the contributions from different bifurcations to determine
the moments of the averaged eigenfunction amplitude is analysed. We argue that
there is a resulting universal hbar-scaling in the semiclassical asymptotics of
these moments for irregular states in systems with a mixed phase-space
dynamics. Finally, a number of these predictions are illustrated by numerical
computations for a family of perturbed cat maps.

polarization of the internal electronic shells (mainly $1s^2$ shell) by the
magnetic field of the external electron. This mechanism is similar to the
polarization of vacuum considered by Karplus and Klein long time ago. The
similarity is the reason why in both cases (Dirac sea polarization and internal
atomic shells polarization) the corrections have the same dependence on the
nuclear charge and fine structure constant.

condition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to

conform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases, but the
most reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails, but rather that
the hidden-variable assumption is false. For this assumption conflicts with the
quantum precept that unperformed experiments have no outcomes. The present
