the nuclear regions of four nearby disk galaxies, and model them as rotation of
a gas disk in the joint potential of the stellar bulge and a putative central
black hole. The targets were selected from a larger set of long-slit spectra
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Survey of Nearby Nuclei
with STIS (SUNNS). They represents the 4 galaxies (of 24) that display
symmetric gas velocity curves consistent with a rotating disk. We derive the
stellar mass distribution from the STIS acquisition images adopting the stellar
mass-to-light ratio normalized so as to match ground-based velocity dispersion
measurements over a large aperture. Subsequently, we constrain the mass of a
putative black hole by matching the gas rotation curve, following two distinct
approaches. In the most general case we explore all the possible disk
orientations, alternatively we constrain the gas disk orientation from the
dust-lane morphology at similar radii. In the latter case the kinematic data
indicate the presence of a central black hole for three of the four objects,
with masses of 10^7 - 10^8 solar masses, representing up to 0.025 % of the host
bulge mass. For one object (NGC2787) the kinematic data alone provide clear
evidence for the presence of a central black hole even without external
constraints on the disk orientation. These results illustrate directly the need
to determine black-hole masses by differing methods for a large number of
objects, demonstrate that the variance in black hole/bulge mass is much larger
than previously claimed, and reinforce the recent finding that the black-hole
mass is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion.

  Conference, Rome, June 2000",,,,"astro-ph",,"  On the basis of a new convergence study of high-resolution N-body
simulations, my colleagues and I now agree that the Navarro, Frenk, & White
(1996) density profile $\rho_{NFW}(r) \propto r^{-1} (r+r_s)^{-2}$ is a good
representation of typical dark matter halos of galactic mass. Comparing
simulations of the same halo with numbers of particles ranging from $\sim10^3$
to $\sim10^6$, we have also shown that $r_s$, the radius where the log-slope is
-2, can be determined accurately for halos with as few as $\sim10^3$ particles.
Based on a study of thousands of halos at many redshifts in an Adaptive
Refinement Tree (ART) simulation of a cosmological volume in a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology, we have found that the concentration $\cvir \equiv \Rvir/\rs$ has a
log-normal distribution, with $1\sigma$ $\Delta (\log \cvir) = 0.18$ at a given
mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of $\Delta
\Vmax/\Vmax = 0.12$. The average concentration declines with redshift at fixed
mass as $\cvir(z) \propto (1+z)^{-1}$. This may have important implications for
galaxy rotation curves. Finally, we have found that the velocity function
determined from galaxy luminosity functions plus luminosity-velocity relations
agrees with the predictions from our $\Lambda$CDM simulations. But we also note
that the very limited evolution with redshift of the velocity function
predicted by $\Lambda$CDM conflicts with the data that is becoming available on
the number density of bright galaxies unless there is significant evolution of
the luminosity-velocity relation at $z>1$.

while activity in nearby clusters seems to be largely diminished, at higher

account for the peculiar but systematic velocity field observed in the nuclear
region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This unusual velocity field with
gradients along both major and minor axes was revealed in a high resolution
($1.8^{\arcsec}\times 1.0^{\arcsec}$) H92$\alpha$ recombination line
observation by Anantharamiah and Goss (1996). A simple logarithmic potential is
used to model the bar. Assuming that the bulk of the gas flows along closed and
non-intersecting x1 (bar) and x2 (anti-bar) orbits of the bar potential, we
have computed the expected velocity field and position-velocity diagrams and
compared them with the observations. A comparison of the integrated CO
intensity maps with the spatial distribution of the x1 and x2 orbits in the
model indicates that the nuclear molecular gas in NGC 253 lies mainly on the x2
orbits. We also find that the velocity field observed in the central 100 pc
region in the H92$\alpha$ recombination line is well accounted for by the bar
model if most of the ionized gas resides in the inner x2 orbits. However, the
model is unable to explain the velocity field on a larger scale of $\sim 500$
pc observed using the OVRO interferometer with a resolution of
$5^{\arcsec}\times 3^{\arcsec}$. The direction of the observed CO velocity

of R=5, 10 and 20h^-1Mpc using an LCDM hydrodynamical simulation. We
particularly put emphasis on the environmental dependence of \mach on
overdensity, galaxy mass, and galaxy age. We start by discussing the difference
in the resulting \mach according to different definitions of \mach and
different methods of calculation. The simulated Mach numbers are slightly lower
than the linear theory predictions even when a non-linear power spectrum was
used in the calculation, reflecting the non-linear evolution in the simulation.
We find that the observed \mach is higher than the simulated mean by more than
2-standard deviations, which suggests either that the Local Group is in a
relatively low-density region or that the true value of \Omega_m is ~ 0.2,
significantly lower than the simulated value of 0.37. We show from our
simulation that the Mach number is a weakly decreasing function of overdensity.
We also investigate the correlations between galaxy age, overdensity and \mach
for two different samples of galaxies --- DWARFs and GIANTs. Older systems
cluster in higher density regions with lower \mach, while younger ones tend to
reside in lower density regions with larger \mach, as expected from the
hierarchical structure formation scenario. However, for DWARFs, the correlation
is weakened by the fact that some of the oldest DWARFs are left over in
low-density regions during the structure formation history. For giant systems,
one expects blue-selected samples to have higher \mach than red-selected ones.
We briefly comment on the effect of the warm dark matter on the expected Mach
number.

photometric technique for isolating G and K giant stars, spectroscopic
follow-up of giant candidates is vital. There are two situations in which
interlopers outnumber genuine giants in the diagnostic M-51/M-T2 plot, and are
indistinguishable photometrically from the giants. (1) In deep surveys covering
tens of square degrees, very metal-poor halo dwarfs are a significant
contaminant. An example is our survey of the outer halo (Morrison et al. 2000,
Dohm-Palmer et al. 2000), where these metal-poor dwarfs dominate the number of
photometric giant candidates at magnitudes fainter than V = 18 and cannot be
isolated photometrically. (2) In deep surveys of smaller areas with low
photometric precision, most objects in the giant region of the color-color plot
are dwarfs whose photometric errors have moved them there. Color errors in M-51
and M-T2 need to be smaller than 0.03 mag to avoid this problem. An example of
a survey whose photometric errors place the giant identifications under
question is the survey for extra-tidal giants around the Carina dwarf
spheroidal of Majewski et al. (2000a). Accurate photometry and spectroscopic
follow-up of giant candidates are essential when using the Washington system to
identify the rare outer-halo giants.

is in contrast with standard maximum likelihood techniques which require N^3

present fast techniques which rely on symmetries of the underlying noise
matrix, sky coverage, scanning strategy, and geometry. This enables for the
first time the analysis of megapixel maps without symmetries. The key element
of our technique is the accurate multipole decomposition of \xi(\theta). The
C_l error bars and cross-correlations are found by a Monte-Carlo approach. We
applied our technique to a large number of simulated maps with Boomerang sky
coverage in 81000 pixels. We used a diagonal noise matrix, with approximately
the same amplitude as Boomerang. These studies demonstrate that our technique
provides an unbiased estimator of the C_l's. Even though our method is
approximate, the error bars obtained are nearly optimal, and converged only
after few tens of Monte-Carlo realizations. Our method is directly applicable
for the non-diagonal noise matrix. This, and other generalizations, such as
minimum variance weighting schemes, polarization, and higher order statistics

curves and spectra for GRB afterglows when such jets expand either in the
interstellar medium or in the wind medium. In particular, we take into account
two kinds of wind: one ($n\propto r^{-3/2}$) possibly from a typical red
supergiant star and another ($n\propto r^{-2}$) possibly from a Wolf-Rayet

increases. When $k\ge 2$, the break seems to disappear but the afterglow decays
rapidly. Thus, one expects that the emission from expanding, highly anisotropic

Submitted to EPJ E",,"10.1007/s101890170070",,"cond-mat",,"  We investigate, using numerical simulations and analytical arguments, a
simple one dimensional model for the swelling or the collapse of a closed
polymer chain of size N, representing the dynamical evolution of a polymer in a
\Theta-solvent that is rapidly changed into a good solvent (swelling) or a bad
solvent (collapse). In the case of swelling, the density profile for
intermediate times is parabolic and expands in space as t^{1/3}, as predicted
by a Flory-like continuum theory. The dynamics slows down after a time \propto
N^2 when the chain becomes stretched, and the polymer gets stuck in metastable
`zig-zag' configurations, from which it escapes through thermal activation. The
size of the polymer in the final stages is found to grow as \sqrt{\ln t}. In
the case of collapse, the chain very quickly (after a time of order unity)
breaks up into clusters of monomers (`pearls'). The evolution of the chain then
proceeds through a slow growth of the size of these metastable clusters, again
evolving as the logarithm of time. We enumerate the total number of metastable
states as a function of the extension of the chain, and deduce from this
computation that the radius of the chain should decrease as 1/\ln(\ln t). We
compute the total number of metastable states with a given value of the energy,
and find that the complexity is non zero for arbitrary low energies. We also
obtain the distribution of cluster sizes, that we compare to simple
`cut-in-two' coalescence models. Finally, we determine the aging properties of
the dynamical structure. The subaging behaviour that we find is attributed to
the tail of the distribution at small cluster sizes, corresponding to
anomalously `fast' clusters (as compared to the average). We argue that this
mechanism for subaging might hold in other slowly coarsening systems.

numerical micromagnetic approach uses the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
including contributions from thermal fluctuations and long-range dipole-dipole
demagnetizing effects implemented using a fast-multipole expansion. The
individual model nanomagnets are 9 nm x 9 nm x 150 nm iron pillars similar to
those fabricated on a surface with STM-assisted chemical vapor deposition [S.
Wirth, et al., J. Appl. Phys {\bf 85}, 5249 (1999)]. Nanomagnets oriented
perpendicular to the surface and spaced 300 nm apart in linear arrays are
considered. The applied field is always oriented perpendicular to the surface.
When the magnitude of the applied field is less than the coercive value, about
2000 Oe for an individual nanomagnet, magnetization reversal in the nanomagnets
can only occur by thermally activated processes. Even though the interaction
from the dipole moment of neighboring magnets in this geometry is only about 1
Oe, less than 1% of the coercive field, it can have a large impact on the
switching dynamics. What determines the height of the free-energy barrier is
the difference between the coercive and applied fields, and 1 Oe can be a
significant fraction of that. The magnetic orientations of the neighbors are
seen to change the behavior of the nanomagnets in the array significantly.

the near horizon D6-brane theory, non-commutative gauge theory on a D2-brane,
the Matrix Theory of D0-branes and finally as a giant graviton in M-theory. The
soliton can be described as a D2-brane with an incompressible fluid of
D0-branes and charged string-ends moving on it. Including an NS5 brane in the
system allows for the existence of an edge with the characteristic massless
chiral edge states of the Quantum Hall system.

A683 (2001) 618-634","10.1016/S0375-9474(00)00474-7",,"nucl-th",,"  In many statistical multifragmentation models the volume available to the $N$
nonoverlapping fragments forming a given partition is a basic ingredient
serving to the simplification of the density of states formula. One therefore
needs accurate techniques for calculating this quantity. While the direct
Monte-Carlo procedure consisting of randomly generating the fragments into the
freeze-out volume and counting the events with no overlapped fragments is
numerically affordable only for partitions with small $N$, the present paper
proposes a Metropolis - type simulation which allows accurate evaluations of
the free volume even for cases with large $N$. This procedure is used for
calculating the available volume for various situations. Though globally this
quantity has an exponential dependence on $N$, variations of orders of
magnitude for partitions with the same $N$ may be identified. A parametrization
based on the virial approximation adjusted with a calibration function,
describing very well the variations of the free volume for different partitions
having the same $N$ is proposed. This parametrization was successfully tested
within the microcanonical multifragmentation model from [Al. H. Raduta and Ad.
R. Raduta, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 55}, 1344 (1997); {\it ibid.}, {\bf 56}, 2059
(1997)]. Finally, it is proven that parametrizations of the free volume solely
dependent on $N$ are rather inadequate for multifragmentation studies producing
important deviations from the exact results.

  Problems, Dubna, Russia, 25-29 Sept. 2000",,,,"nucl-th",,"  We compare the existing data about electromagnetic form factors of the proton
in the time-like region of momentum transfer (up to $q^2\simeq$ 14
(GeV/c)$^2$), with the corresponding data in the space-like region. From the
constrains given by the Phragm\`en-Lindel\""of theorem, it turns out that the
asymptotic regime can not be reached simultaneously for both form factors
(electric and magnetic) in the considered region of momentum transfer. The
angular dependence for the annihilation processes, such as
$\bar{p}+p\leftrightarrow e^++e^-$, is sensitive to the asymptotic properties
of form factors and to the two-photon physics in the time-like region.

isospin cranked mean-field approach. The response of pairing correlations to
rotation in isospace is investigated. It is shown that whereas the isovector
pairing rather modestly modifies the single-particle moment of inertia in
isospace, the isoscalar pairing strongly reduces its value. This reduction of
the moments of inertia in isospace with respect to its rigid body value is a
strong indicator of collective isoscalar pairing correlations. Beautiful
analogies between the role of isovector pairing for the case of spatial
rotations and the role of isoscalar pairing for the case of iso-rotations are
underlined.

potential measure of a type of entanglement of pure states of n qubits, the
n-tangle. For a system of two qubits the n-tangle is equal to the square of the
concurrence, and for systems of three qubits it is equal to the ''residual
entanglement''. We show that the n -tangle, is also equal to the generalization
of concurrence squared for even n, and use this fact to prove that the n-tangle
is an entanglement monotone. However, the n-tangle is undefined for odd n>3.
Finally we propose a measure related to the n-tangle for mixed state systems of
n qubits, and find an analytical formula for this measure for even n.

  July 3-8 2000",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum communication schemes widely use dielectric four-port devices as
basic elements for constructing optical quantum channels. Since for causality
reasons the permittivity is necessarily a complex function of frequency,
dielectrics are typical examples of noisy quantum channels in which quantum
coherence will not be preserved. Basing on quantization of the phenomenological
electrodynamics, we construct the transformation relating the output quantum
state to the input quantum state without placing frequency restrictions.
Knowledge of the full transformed quantum state enables us to compute the
entanglement contained in the output quantum state. We apply the formalism to
some typical examples in quantum communication.
