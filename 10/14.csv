possible ionization mechanisms of the DIG to be examined. Photoionization
models which assume a dilute radiation field are able to fit the data for the
disk, but they cannot account for the line ratios measured in the halo (e.g.,
[OI]/Halpha or [OII]/Halpha). In particular they fail to predict the observed
increase of [OIII]5007/Halpha with increasing z. The most striking result
concerns the kinematics of the halo gas. Velocities at high galactic latitudes
drop from the midplane value to reach the systemic velocity at z ~ 9 kpc. An
analysis of VLA archive data of the polarized radio-continuum emission at 4.86
GHz and 1.49 GHz reveals that magnetic fields in the halo have a strong
component perpendicular to the disk and are aligned with the Halpha and
radio-continuum spurs in the halo. This can result either from a strong wind
action or, more likely, from the generation of dipolar magnetic fields. We
briefly discuss the interrelation of the magnetic field structure and gas
dynamics, in particular the role of magnetic fields in gas outflows, as well as
the possible heating of DIG by magnetic reconnection.

Application of this technique to a long RXTE observation of MCG--6-30-15
indicates that the line flux does vary on short (~1d) timescales, but that
these variations are not correlated with changes in the continuum flux or
slope. These rapid variations indicate that the line does indeed originate
close to the black hole, confirming predictions based on its very broad
profile. However, the lack of a correlation with the continuum presents
problems for models in which the line variations are driven by those in the
continuum, modified only by light-travel time effects. Instead, it may be that
the line responds according to a physical process with a different time scale,
such as ionization instabilities in the disk, or perhaps that the geometry and
physical picture is more complex than implied by the simplest disk-corona
models.
  These data also indicate that the slope of the underlying power-law continuum
(Gamma) shows strong variability and is tightly correlated with the continuum
flux in the sense that the spectrum steepens as the source brightens. All of
these results have been checked with extensive simulations, which also
indicated that a spurious correlation between Gamma and Compton reflection

the Fornax cluster. For the star clusters in this sample, we measure a mean
radial velocity of 1698 +/- 46 km/s, a rotation velocity of 175 +/- 70 km/s,
and a velocity dispersion of 227 +/- 33 km/s within a galactocentric radius of
24 kpc. Using the projected mass estimator and assuming isotropic orbits, the
estimated total mass is (6.6 +/- 1.7) E+11 solar masses within a radius of 24
kpc. The mass is uncertain by about a factor of two, depending on the orbital
assumptions. The implied M/L_B ratio is in the range 3-6. Four star clusters in
our sample are exceptionally luminous (M_V < -12.3). This means that (1) at
least this many clusters in NGC 1316 are up to an order of magnitude more
luminous than the most luminous star cluster in our Galaxy or M31, and (2) that
the S/N ratio of their spectra allows us to measure line strengths with good
accuracy. By comparing the colours and equivalent widths of H-alpha and the Ca
II triplet absorption lines for those bright star clusters in our sample with

Irregularities in this magnetic field may be present due to turbulence, waves
or perhaps other causes, and may play an essential role in the structure and
evolution of the gas clouds. To infer information about these irregularities
from the observational data, we develop statistical relationships between the
rms values of the irregular component of the magnetic field and spatial
variations in the circular polarization of the spectral line radiation. The
irregularities are characterized in analogy with descriptions of
turbulence---by a sum of Fourier waves having a power spectrum with a slope
similar to that of Kolmogorov turbulence. For comparison, we also perform
computations in which turbulent magnetic and velocity fields from
representative MHD simulations by others are utilized. Although the effects of
the variations about the mean value of the magnetic field along the path of a
ray tend to cancel, a significant residual effect in the polarization of the
emergent radiation remains for typical values of the relevant parameters. A map
of observed spectra of the 21 cm line toward Orion A is analyzed and the
results are compared with our calculations in order to infer the strength of
the irregular component of the magnetic field. The rms of the irregular
component is found to be comparable in magnitude to the mean magnetic field
within the cloud. Hence, the turbulent and Alfven velocities should also be
comparable.

somewhat flatter than a Keplerian rotation law and is consistent with a disk
mass on the order of 10^5 Msun. Clumpy substructure may display a kinematic
signature consistent with spiral arms. Away from the disk, a second population
of water masers traces broadly a bipolar, wide-angle outflow that contains
(bullet-like) clumps ejected from a region centered on the central engine and
<0.1 pc in radius. Out to a radius of about 0.4 pc, the warp of the accretion
disk appears to channel the outflow, the orientation of which on the sky

Beyond this radius, the flow crosses the disk and truncates it. This suggests
that the current accretion event and associated disk-outflow geometry have a

Galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity are
well-fit by a de Vaucouleurs bulge with exponential disk profile. 2)
Morphologically classifying these nearby group galaxies by their bulge fraction

Lick and at Whipple Observatories have revealed evidence of three periodicities
in the line-of-sight velocity of the star. These periodicities have been
interpreted as evidence for at least three low mass companions (LMCs) revolving
around Upsilon Andromedae. The mass and orbital parameters inferred for these
companions raise questions about the dynamical stability of the system. We
report here results from our independent analysis of the published radial
velocity data as well as new unpublished data taken at Lick Observatory. Our
results confirm the finding of three periods in the data. Our best fits to the
data, on the assumption that these periods arise from the gravitational
perturbations of companions in keplerian orbits, is also generally in
agreement, but with some differences, from the earlier findings. We find that
the available data do not constrain well the orbital eccentricity of the middle
companion in a three-companion model of the data. We also find that in order
for our best-fit model to the Lick data to be dynamically stable over the
lifetime of the star (~2 billion years), the system must have a mean
inclination to the plane of the sky greater than 13 degrees. The corresponding
minimum inclination for the best fit to the Whipple data set is 19 degrees.
These values imply that the maximum mass for the outer companion can be no
greater than about 20 Jupiter masses. Our analysis of the stability of the
putative systems also places constraints on the relative inclinations of the
orbital planes of the companions. We comment on global versus local (i.e.,
method of steepest descent) means of finding best-fit orbits from radial
velocity data sets.

``spike'' which separates the dips with hard and soft spectra marks the
beginning of the burst phase when the luminosity of the soft X-rays (5-15 keV)
increases by a large factor (~ 10). This produces a major ejection episode of
the synchrotron - emitting plasma termed as ``baby jets'' which are associated
with infrared (IR) and radio flares of about half an hour period widely
reported in the literature. Subsequent short but frequent soft dips produce
overlapping faint flares which result in an enhanced level of quasi-steady
emission. We discuss the dissipation of accretion energy in the inner part of
the disk in terms of a comptonising cloud and the escaping mass which produces
synchrotron radiation. We discuss the differences between ``baby jets'' and
relativistic radio jets and especially investigate their signatures in X-rays.
Our results support the relativistic jet model with quasi-continuous mass
ejection and strong variations in the jet speeds required for the formation of
strong internal shocks to continuously accelerate the particles.

large-scale morphological components of PNe. We show that both the observed
velocities and locations of most non-symmetrical LISs can be reasonably well
reproduced assuming either fossil condensations originated in the AGB wind or
in-situ instabilities. The jet models proposed to date (HD and MHD interacting
winds or accretion-disk collimated winds) appear unable to account
simultaneously for the kinematical ages and the angle between the jet and the
symmetry axes of the nebulae. The linear increase in velocity observed in
several jets favors MHD confinement compared to pure HD interacting wind
models. On the other hand, we find that the formation of jet-like systems
characterized by relatively low expansion velocities cannot be explained by any
of the existing models. Finally, the knots which appear in symmetrical and

(symmetrical) condensations formed during the AGB phase or as structures that

The changes in the linewidth, g-factor and intensity as functions of

T_co in terms of motional narrowing caused by the hopping of the Jahn-Teller

data on Pr_0.6Ca_0.4MnO_3 published earlier gives E_a=0.2 eV. Below T_co, the
g-value increases continuously suggesting a gradual strengthening of the
orbital ordering. We give a qualitative explanation of the temperature

predictability from the perspective of computational complexity. We develop a
simple agent-based model for a stock market where the agents are traders
equipped with simple trading strategies, and their trades together determine
the stock prices. Computer simulations show that a basic case of this model is
already capable of generating price graphs which are visually similar to the
recent price movements of high tech stocks. In the general model, we prove that
if there are a large number of traders but they employ a relatively small
number of strategies, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm for predicting
future price movements with high accuracy. On the other hand, if the number of
strategies is large, market prediction becomes complete in two new
computational complexity classes CPP and BCPP, which are between P^NP[O(log n)]
and PP. These computational completeness results open up a novel possibility
that the price graph of an actual stock could be sufficiently deterministic for
various prediction goals but appear random to all polynomial-time prediction
algorithms.

don't come out. However, Stephen Hawking calculated that black holes actually
radiate quantum mechanical particles. The two important ingredients that result
in back hole evaporation are (1) the spacetime geometry, in particular the
black hole horizon, and (2) the fact that the notion of a ""particle"" is not an
invariant concept in quantum field theory. These notes contain a step-by-step
presentation of Hawking's calculation. We review portions of quantum field
theory in curved spacetime and basic results about static black hole
geometries, so that the discussion is self-contained. Calculations are
presented for quantum particle production for an accelerated observer in flat
spacetime, a black hole which forms from gravitational collapse, an eternal
Schwarzschild black hole, and charged black holes in asymptotically deSitter
spacetimes. The presentation highlights the similarities in all these
calculations. Hawking radiation from black holes also points to a profound
connection between black hole dynamics and classical thermodynamics. A theory
of quantum gravity must predicting and explain black hole thermodynamics. We
briefly discuss these issues and point out a connection between black hole
evaportaion and the positive mass theorems in general relativity.

analytic set has a stratification. This result was extended by Lojasiewicz to
real (semi)analytic sets. In this paper we present a short geometric proof of
existence of stratifications based on Thom's transversality theorem and
Milnor's curve selection lemma and not relying on difficult results of

rationals, i.e. for some C, nu>0 and any relatively prime p, q in Z we have
|alpha q -p|>C q^{-1-\vu}. It is well-known and easy to prove that almost every
alpha in R is diophantine. In this paper we address a noncommutative version of
the question about diophantine properties. Consider a pair A,B in SO(3) and for
each n in Z_+ take all possible words in A, A^{-1}, B, and B^{-1} of length n,
i.e. for a multiindex I=(i_1,j_1,..., i_s,j_s) put |I|=\sum_{k=1}^s
(|i_k|+|j_k|) and W_{A,B}(n)={W_{I}(A,B)= A^{i_1}B^{j_1}...
A^{i_s}B^{j_s}}_{|I|=n}.
  Gamburd-Jakobson-Sarnak raised the problem: prove that for Haar almost every
pair A, B in SO(3) the closest distance of the word of length n to the
identity, i.e. s_{A,B}(n)=min_{|I|=n} |W_{I}(A,B)-Id|, is bounded from below by
an exponential function in n. This is an analog of diophantine property for
elements of SO(3). In this paper we make first step toward understanding
diophantine properties of SO(3). We prove that s_{A,B}(n) is bounded from below
by an exponential function in n^2. We also exhibit obstructions to prove a
simple exponential in n estimate.

  dissipative medium","LaTeX file 37 pages, 2 EPS figures. accepted to print by
  Acustica-Acta Acustica",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  Nonlinear plane acoustic waves propagating through a fluid are studied using
Burgers' equation with finite viscosity. The evolution of a simple N-pulse with
regular and random initial amplitude and of pulses with monochromatic and noise
carrier is considered. In the latter case the initial pulses are characterized
by two length scales. The length scale of the modulation function is much
greater than the period or the length scale of the carrier. With increasing
time the initial pulses are deformed and shocks appear. The finite viscosity
leads to a finite shock width, which does not depend on the fine structure of
the initial pulse and is fully determined by the shock position in the zero
viscosity limit. The other effect of nonzero viscosity is the shift of the
shock position from the position at zero viscosity. This shift, as well as the
linear time, at which the nonlinear stage of evolution changes to the linear
stage, depends on the fine structure of the initial pulse. It is also shown
that the nonlinearity of the medium leads to generation of a nonzero mean field
from an initial random field with zero mean value. The relative fluctuation of
the field is investigated both at the nonlinear and the linear stage.
