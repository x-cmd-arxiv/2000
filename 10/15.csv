lines from radioactive isotopes (such as 26Al and 60Fe in conjunction with
other multi-wavelength observables of Galactic clusters, associations, and
alike objects. Our evolutionary synthesis models are based on the code of
Cervino & Mas-Hesse (1994), which has been updated to include recent stellar
evolution tracks, new stellar atmospheres for OB and WR stars, and
nucleosynthetic yields from massive stars during hydrostatic burning phases and
explosive SN II and SN Ib events. The temporal evolution of 26Al and 60Fe
production, the equivalent yield of 26Al per ionising O7 V star (yal), and
other observables are predicted for a coeval population. We also employed our
model to estimate the steady state nucleosynthesis of a population of solar
metallicity. To allow for a fully quantitative analysis of existing and future
multi-wavelength observations, we propose a Bayesian approach that allows the
inclusion of IMF richness effects and observational uncertainties in the
analysis. In particular, a Monte Carlo technique is adopted to estimate
probability distributions for all observables of interest. We outline the
procedure of exploiting these distributions by applying our model to a fictive
massive star association. Applications to existing observations of the Cygnus
and Vela regions will be discussed in companion papers.

new difference light curves (about 330 days of overlap between the time-shifted
light curve for the A image and the magnitude-shifted light curve for the B
image). We observed noisy behaviours around the zero line and no
short-timescale events (with a duration of months), where the term event refers
to a prominent feature that may be due to microlensing or another source of
variability. Only one event lasting two weeks and rising - 33 mmag was found.
Measured constraints on the possible microlensing variability can be used to
obtain information on the granularity of the dark matter in the main lensing
galaxy and the size of the source. In addition, one can also test the ability
of the observational noise to cause the rms averages and the local features of
the difference signals. We focused on this last issue. The combined
photometries were related to a process consisting of an intrinsic signal plus a
Gaussian observational noise. The intrinsic signal has been assumed to be
either a smooth function (polynomial) or a smooth function plus a stationary
noise process or a correlated stationary process. Using these three pictures
without microlensing, we derived some models totally consistent with the
observations. We finally discussed the sensitivity of our telescope (at Teide
Observatory) to several classes of microlensing variability.

extensive mixing of radioactive material in SN ejecta. The mixing of
radioactive material, mostly freshly synthesized Ni, is not complete, which
leads to a two-phase SN ejecta structure. The low-density phase consists of Fe
bubbles, created by the energy input from radioactive Co and Ni, surrounded by
compressed high-density metal-rich ejecta. We report on the theoretical
investigation of supernova remnant (SNR) dynamics with the two-phase SN ejecta.
We first present 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a single Fe bubble
immersed in an outer ejecta envelope, and compare the results with previous
work on shock-cloud interactions. We then consider randomly distributed Fe
bubbles with an average volume filling fraction of 1/2. We find that the
presence of Fe bubbles leads to vigorous turbulence and mixing of Fe with other
heavy elements and with the ambient normal-abundance gas. The turbulent energy
can be an order of magnitude larger than in the case of smooth ejecta. A
significant fraction of the shocked ejecta is found in narrow filaments and
clumps moving with radial velocities larger than the velocity of the forward
shock. Observational consequences of the two-phase ejecta on SNR X-ray spectra
and images are briefly mentioned.

scattering within an effective Lagrangian model which incorporates the Delta,
N, rho and sigma meson degrees of freedom. This model provides a description of
the Delta resonance and its interactions that respects electromagnetic gauge
invariance and invariance under contact transformations when finite width
effects are incorporated. Following recent developments in the description of
unstable gauge bosons, we use a complex mass scheme to introduce the finite
width of the Delta^{++} without spoiling gauge invariance. The total cross
section of elastic \pi^+p scattering, whose amplitude exhibits the resonant
plus background structure of S-matrix theory, is used to fix the mass, width
and strong coupling of the \Delta resonance. The differential cross section of
elastic scattering is found in very good agreement with experimental data. The
magnetic dipole moment of the Delta^{++}, \mu_{Delta}, is left as the only
adjustable parameter in radiative \pi^+p scattering. From a fit to the most
sensitive configurations for photon emission in this process, we obtain
\mu_{\Delta} = (6.14 +-0.51)e/2m_p, in agreement with predictions based on the
SU(6) quark model.

displacement of a hydrogenic bound state in an electric field (known as the
Stark effect or the LoSurdo-Stark effect), which constitutes a divergent formal
power series in the electric field strength. The perturbation series exhibits a
rich singularity structure in the Borel plane. Resummation methods are
presented which appear to lead to consistent results even in problematic cases
where isolated singularities or branch cuts are present on the positive and
negative real axis in the Borel plane. Two resummation prescriptions are
compared: (i) a variant of the Borel-Pade resummation method, with an
additional improvement due to utilization of the leading renormalon poles (for
a comprehensive discussion of renormalons see [M. Beneke, Phys. Rep. vol. 317,
p. 1 (1999)]), and (ii) a contour-improved combination of the Borel method with
an analytic continuation by conformal mapping, and Pade approximations in the
conformal variable. The singularity structure in the case of the LoSurdo-Stark
effect in the complex Borel plane is shown to be similar to (divergent)
perturbative expansions in quantum chromodynamics.
