a spherical blast wave with a power-law distribution of electron energy above

narrow jet, often invoked to explain the steep decline and/or steepening of

model has been applied to GRBs 991208 and 000301C, based to a large extent on
radio observations. We show that, for these two sources, a spherical wind model

fairly abrupt steepening of the R-band light curves of, respectively, GRB

clusters with the X-ray method. As this method takes into account only thermal
pressure, additional non-thermal pressure support, e.g. caused by a magnetic
field, can result in an underestimation of the mass. SPH models of galaxy
clusters including magnetic fields of various strengths in two different
cosmologies are used for the test. We compare the true mass of the model
clusters with the mass determined from simulated X-ray images of the same
models. The effect of the magnetic field on the mass in relaxed clusters is
found to be negligible compared to other uncertainties, even at small radii,
where the strongest effects are expected. However in one model, in which the
cluster is in the process of merging, we find an effect of up to a factor of 2
caused by the magnetic field. In relaxed clusters the mass estimate, averaged
over many models, is at most 15% smaller in models with relatively high
magnetic field of $2\mu$G compared to models without a magnetic field with a

results by Zobnin for m=1 and by Bradley and Wu for 0 < m < 2. To improve on
this self-consistent theory which neglects the dependence of stress on damage,
we apply the functional renormalization method of Yukalov and Gluzman and find
that divergences are replaced by singularities with exponents in agreement with
those found in acoustic emission experiments. For m =2 and m > 2, the rupture
dynamics is not defined without the introduction of a regularizing scheme. We
investigate three regularization schemes involving respectively a saturation of
damage, a minimum distance of approach to the crack tip and a fixed stress
maximum. In the first and third schemes, the finite-time singularity is
replaced by a crack dynamics defined for all times but which is controlled by
either the existence of a microscopic scale at which the stress is regularized
or by the maximum sustainable stress. In the second scheme, a finite-time
singularity is again found. In the first two schemes within this regime m > 2,
the theory has no continuous limit.

critical point is strongly influenced by capillary condensation which occurs
below the bulk critical temperature T_c. At T slightly below and above T_c, a
small bulk field h<0, which favours gas, or (-) phase, leads to residual
condensation and a solvation force which is much more attractive (at the same
large wall separation) than that found exactly at the critical point. Our
predictions are supported by results obtained from density-matrix

polynomial-time algorithm for the case of parity functions that depend on only
the first O(log n log log n) bits of input. This is the first known instance of
an efficient noise-tolerant algorithm for a concept class that is provably not
learnable in the Statistical Query model of Kearns. Thus, we demonstrate that
the set of problems learnable in the statistical query model is a strict subset
of those problems learnable in the presence of noise in the PAC model.
  In coding-theory terms, what we give is a poly(n)-time algorithm for decoding
linear k by n codes in the presence of random noise for the case of k = c log n
loglog n for some c > 0. (The case of k = O(log n) is trivial since one can
just individually check each of the 2^k possible messages and choose the one
that yields the closest codeword.)
  A natural extension of the statistical query model is to allow queries about
statistical properties that involve t-tuples of examples (as opposed to single
examples). The second result of this paper is to show that any class of
functions learnable (strongly or weakly) with t-wise queries for t = O(log n)
is also weakly learnable with standard unary queries. Hence this natural
extension to the statistical query model does not increase the set of weakly

the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor
and/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for
LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,
very low. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation effect, i.e. the
dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. Also it is useful to
consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the direction of the
recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study the modulation effect both in non
directional and directional experiments. We calculate both the differential and
the total rates usingi both isothermal, symmetric as well as only axially
asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity distributions.
We consider We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is
small. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of
asymmetry, with a enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction,
yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional experiments.

of the model is the concept of two preference relations determining Subject
behaviour. These are an ""internal"" or subjective preference relation and an
""external"" or objective preference relation.
  The first (internal) preference relation is defined by some partial order on
a set of states of the Subject. The second (external) preference relation on
the state set is defined by a mapping from the state set to another partially
ordered set. The mapping will be called evaluation mapping (function).
  We research the process of external preference maximization in a fashion that
uses the external preference as little as possible. On the contrary, Subject
may use the internal preference without any restriction.
  The complexity of a maximization procedure depends on the disagreement
between these preferences. To solve the problem we apply some kind of the
successive approximations methods. In terms of evaluation mappings this method
operates on a decomposition of the mapping into a superposition of several
standard operations and ""easy"" mappings (see the details below). Obtained in
such way superpositions are called approximating forms.
  We construct several such forms and present two applications. One of them is
concerned with a hypothetic origin of logic. The other application provides a
new interpretation of the well known model of human choice by Lefebvre. The
interpretation seems to suggest a justification different from the one proposed
by Lefebvre himself.

anomalous scaling behavior is considered for two models describing passive
advection of scalar density and tracer fields. The advecting velocity field is
Gaussian, $\delta$-correlated in time, and scales with a positive exponent
$\epsilon$. Explicit inertial-range expressions for the scalar correlation
functions are obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws
with nonuniversal amplitudes and universal (dependent only on $\epsilon$ and
$\alpha$, the compressibility parameter) anomalous exponents. The complete set
of anomalous exponents for the pair correlation functions is found
nonperturbatively, in any space dimension d, using the zero-mode technique. For
higher-order correlation functions, the anomalous exponents are calculated to
$O(\epsilon^{2})$ using the renormalization group. Like in the incompressible
case, the exponents exhibit a hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy:
the leading contributions to the even correlation functions are given by the
exponents from the isotropic shell, in agreement with the idea of restored
small-scale isotropy. As the degree of compressibility increases, the
corrections become closer to the leading terms. The small-scale anisotropy
reveals itself in the odd ratios of correlation functions: the skewness factor
is slowly decreasing going down to small scales for the incompressible case,
but becomes increasing if $\alpha$ is large enough. The higher odd
dimensionless ratios (hyperskewness etc.) increase, thus signalling the
persistent small-scale anisotropy; this effect becomes more pronounced for
larger values of $\alpha$.

spatial solitons propagating at opposite, but arbitrary transverse angles in
quadratic nonlinear (or so-called chi(2)) bulk media. We predict quantitatively
the outwards escape angle, below which the solitons turn around and collide,
and above which they continue to move away from each other. For in-plane
interaction the theory allows prediction of the outcome of a collision through
the inwards escape angle, i.e. whether the solitons fuse or cross. We find an
analytical expression determining the inwards escape angle using Gaussian
approximations for the solitons. The theory is verified numerically.

1H(e,eprime pi+)n were measured in the momentum transfer region Q2=0.6-1.6
(GeV/c)**2 at a value of the invariant mass W=1.95 GeV. New values for the pion
charge form factor were extracted from the longitudinal cross section by using
a recently developed Regge model. The results indicate that the pion form
factor in this region is larger than previously assumed and is consistent with
a monopole parameterization fitted to very low Q2 elastic data.

We also see, in accordance with this experimental work, a distinct shell of

strong tangential ordering of the water molecules in the first hydration shell.

in the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic
Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and an action-reaction model for synaptic
plasticity. Our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just
after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus. The
information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so called
phi-divergences from statistics which quantify a dissimilarity between
probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental
limits in statistics and information theory (IT). We show that there exists a
set of parameters that can optimize several important phi-divergences
simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing
rate (QFR) of the spiral ganglion neuron. The optimal value of the QFR is
frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the
signal (for small amplitudes). Consequently, optimal processing according to
several standard IT criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if
the parameters are ``tuned'' to values that correspond to one and the same QFR.
This offers a new explanation for the QFR and can provide new insight into the
role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system.

  version","Phys.Rev. D63 (2001) 085003","10.1103/PhysRevD.63.085003",,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  We consider the Scharnhorst effect (anomalous photon propagation in the
Casimir vacuum) at oblique incidence, calculating both photon speed and
polarization states as functions of angle. The analysis is performed in the
framework of nonlinear electrodynamics and we show that many features of the
situation can be extracted solely on the basis of symmetry considerations.
Although birefringence is common in nonlinear electrodynamics it is not
universal; in particular we verify that the Casimir vacuum is not birefringent
at any incidence angle. On the other hand, group velocity is typically not
equal to phase velocity, though the distinction vanishes for special directions
or if one is only working to second order in the fine structure constant. We
obtain an ``effective metric'' that is subtly different from previous results.
The disagreement is due to the way that ``polarization sums'' are implemented
in the extant literature, and we demonstrate that a fully consistent
polarization sum must be implemented via a bootstrap procedure using the
effective metric one is attempting to define. Furthermore, in the case of
birefringence, we show that the polarization sum technique is intrinsically an
approximation.
