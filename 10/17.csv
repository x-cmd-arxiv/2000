  INTEGRAL Workshop, Alicante September 2000, corrected dvips output",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The energy range of IBIS is a promising ground for testing mutual relations
of distinct components expected in the spectra of high-energy radiation from
rotation powered pulsars. According to some polar-cap models two such
components - due to curvature and synchrotron emission - may contribute
comparable amounts of power between 15 keV and 10 MeV (Rudak & Dyks 1999).
Zhang & Harding (2000) argued recently for the inclusion of a third possible
component, due to inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of soft thermal photons on
secondary $\epm$-pairs. Here we present the results of Monte Carlo calculations
of all three spectral components within a polar-cap model which allows for
interactions of relativistic particles with the soft photons coming from the
pulsar surface. For teragauss pulsars with the surface temperature of a few
times 10^5 K the ICS component dominates the spectrum in the energy range below
10 MeV, and thus its presence increases the ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray
luminosity (in comparison to the models ignoring the ICS on secondary
$\epm$-pairs) to a level observed in the Vela pulsar.

5 RRc stars, 2 eclipsing binaries of W UMa-type, one SX Phe star, and 3
variables of other types. Both detected contact binaries are foreground stars.
The SX Phe variable belongs most likely to the group of cluster blue

log(L/L_odot)=1.72, T_eff=7300 and Y=0.27. Using RRab variables we obtain:
M_V=0.81, [Fe/H]=-1.53 and T_eff=6450. From the B-V color at minimum light of
the RRab variables we obtained E(B-V)=0.09+-0.01. Different calibrations of
absolute magnitudes of RRab and RRc available in literature were used to
estimate apparent distance modulus of the cluster: (m-M)_V= 16.09+-0.06. We
note a likely error in the zero point of the HST-based V-band photometry of NGC

Stars (SS) on capture/formation of a ``seed'' of strange matter. It is also
known that the binding energy of the nascent hot SS is likely to be radiated as
$\nu -\bar\nu$s so that an electromagnetic pair fireball (FB) may be created by
neutrino annihilation. And already this process has been considered as a
probable source of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) by several authors, the most notable
of which is due to Cheng & Dai (PRL, 77, 1210, 1996). They mentioned that this
process may generate a FB luminosity (outside the neutrinosphere) of 10**(49)
erg. But we point out here that a SS is a relativistic object with surface
gravitation z=0.5. Accordingly, we present here a Relativistic Model of this
process, and show that, for a massive SS with M=2 solar mass, one may explain a
GRB energy of ~ 10**(53) erg., which is 4 orders higher than previous
non-relativistic estimate. Further since the baryonic mass of the thin crust of
a strange star is negligible, this FB will generate an extremely relativistic
blast wave. Thus this process may be one of the viable routes for the genesis
of hitherto unexplained cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts. While some of the GRBs might
be beamed, many of them do not show any long term spectral break in their
afterglows and are likely to be quasi-spherical. A particular example is GRB
971214 for which estimated GRB energy is 3. 10**(53) erg. Our model may be
useful for understanding the genesis of such powerful and unexplained bursts.

gradient, and the radial variations in spectroscopic indices and ultraviolet
colors that have been detected previously must be due to metallicity and/or

we provide estimates of the number of low mass brown dwarfs and isolated

nuclear stellar cluster is slightly resolved in the J and H band with
increasing contribution to the NIR continuum from the K to the J band. The
stellar absorption lines are extended compared to the neighboring continuum
suggesting a cluster size of ~ 70pc FWHM. Analysis of those lines suggests that
the stars are contributing about 65% (40%) of the total continuum emission in
the H (K) band in a 3.6'' aperture. Population synthesis in conjunction with
NIR spectral synthesis indicates an age of 25 to 50 Myr when red supergiants
contribute most to the NIR light. This is supported by published optical data
on the MgIb line and the CaII triplet. Although a higher age of ~ 0.5 Gyr where
AGB stars dominate the NIR light can not be excluded, the observed parameters
are at the limit of those expected for a cluster dominated by AGB stars.
However, in either case the resolved stellar cluster contributes only about ~
15 % of the total dynamical mass in the inner 300pc implying another much older
stellar population. Pure constant star formation over the last 10 Gyr can be
excluded. Therefore, at least two star formation/starburst events took place in
the nucleus of NGC3227. Since such sequences in the nuclear star formation
history are also observed in the nuclei of other galaxies a link between the
activity of the star formation and the AGN itself seems likely.

strong evidence for an accretion disk near a supermassive black hole as a
source of the emission. Here we present an analysis of the geometrical and
kinematic properties of the disk based on the extreme frequency shifts of a
line profile as determined by measurable flux in both the red and blue wings.
The edges of the line are insensitive to the distribution of the X-ray flux
over the disk, and hence provide a robust alternative to profile fitting of
disk parameters. Our approach yields new, strong bounds on the inclination
angle of the disk and the location of the emitting region. We apply our method
to interpret observational data from MCG-6-30-15 and find that the commonly
assumed inclination 30 deg for the accretion disk in MCG-6-30-15 is
inconsistent with the position of the blue edge of the line at a 3 sigma level.
A thick turbulent disk model or the presence of highly ionized iron may
reconcile the bounds on inclination from the line edges with the full line
profile fits based on simple, geometrically thin disk models. The bounds on the
innermost radius of disk emission indicate that the black hole in MCG-6-30-15
is rotating faster than 30 % of theoretical maximum. When applied to data from
NGC 4151, our method gives bounds on the inclination angle of the X-ray
emitting inner disk of 50\pm 10 deg, consistent with the presence of an
ionization cone grazing the disk as proposed by Pedlar et al. (1993). The
frequency extrema analysis also provides limits to the innermost disk radius in

GRB 000131 was a bright, long-duration GRB, with an apparent precursor signal
62 s prior to trigger. The afterglow was detected in ESO VLT, NTT, and DK1.54m
follow-up observations. Broad-band and spectroscopic observations of the
spectral energy distribution reveals a sharp break at optical wavelengths which
is interpreted as a Ly-alpha absorption edge at 6700 A. This places GRB 000131
at a redshift of 4.500 +/- 0.015. The inferred isotropic energy release in
gamma rays alone was approximately 10^54 erg (depending on the assumed
cosmology). The rapid power-law decay of the afterglow (index alpha=2.25,
similar to bursts with a prior break in the lightcurve), however, indicates
collimated outflow, which relaxes the energy requirements by a factor of < 200.

observed surface torsional oscillations extend significantly downwards into the
solar convection zone.
  In an attempt to understand these oscillations, we study the nonlinear
coupling between the magnetic field and the solar differential rotation in the
context of a mean field dynamo model, in which the nonlinearity is due to the
action of the azimuthal component of the Lorentz force of the dynamo generated
magnetic field on the solar angular velocity. The underlying zero order angular
velocity is chosen to be consistent with the most recent helioseismic data.
  The model produces butterfly diagrams which are in qualitative agreement with
the observations. It displays torsional oscillations that penetrate into the
convection zone, and which with time migrate towards the equator. The period of
these oscillations is found to be half that of the period of the global
magnetic fields. This is compatible with the observed period of the surface
torsional oscillations. Inside the convection zone, this is a testable
prediction that is not ruled out by the observations so far available.

aimed to address two basic questions, namely: Should one expect to see cuspy,
triaxial galaxies in nature? And can one construct realistic cuspy, triaxial
equilibrium models that are robust? Three technical results are described: (1)
Unperturbed chaotic orbits in cuspy triaxial potentials can be extraordinarily
sticky, much more so than orbits in many other three-dimensional potentials.
(2) Even very weak perturbations can be important by drastically reducing,
albeit not completely eliminating, this stickiness. (3) A simple toy model
facilitates a simple understanding of why black holes and cusps can serve as an
effective source of chaos. These results suggest that, when constructing models
of galaxies using Schwarzschild's method or any analogue thereof, astronomers
would be well advised to use orbital building blocks that have been perturbed
by `noise' or other weak irregularities, since such building blocks are likely
to be more nearly time-independent than orbits evolved in the absence of all

recent results for the solution of generalised Langevin equations, we show that
the equilibrium solution for the probability distribution of wealth has two
characteristic regimes. For large values of wealth it takes the form of a
Pareto style power law. For small values of wealth, (w less then wmin) the
distribution function tends sharply to zero with infinite slope. The origin of
this law lies in the random multiplicative process built into the model. Whilst
such results have been known since the time of Gibrat, the present framework
allows for a stable power law in an arbitrary and irregular global dynamics, so
long as the market is `fair', i.e., there is no net advantage to any particular
group or individual. We show for our model that the relative distribution of
wealth follows a time independent distribution of this form even thought the
total wealth may follow a more complicated dynamics and vary with time in an
arbitrary manner. In developing the theory, we draw parallels with conventional
thermodynamics and derive for the system the associated laws of `econodynamics'
together with the associated econodynamic potentials. The power law that arises
in the distribution function may then be identified with new additional
logarithmic terms in the familiar Boltzmann distribution function for the
system. The distribution function of stock market returns for our model, it is
argued, will follow the same qualitative laws and exhibit power law behaviour.

calculations. By varying the size of roughly circular clusters, the edge energy
per atom is obtained; it agrees quite well with estimates based on experimental
results. Small three-dimensional clusters tend to have the shape of a pyramid,
whose sides are oriented in the directions of small surface energy. The
presence of a cluster is found to distort the underlying lattice of adsorbed
copper atoms.

uses morphological inflection to mark case, and therefore semantic relations
have to be inferred from suffixes rather than from prepositions. Our approach
combines a morphological analyser and surface syntax parsing (based on
Constraint Grammar), and has proven very successful for highly inflected
languages such as Basque. Both the effort to write the rules and the actual
processing time of the dictionary have been very low. At present we have
extracted 42,533 relations, leaving only 2,943 (9%) definitions without any

phase \alpha. In this paper we show that these same decays can be used to
search for new physics. This is done by comparing two weak phases which are
equal in the standard model: the phase of the t-quark contribution to the b ->
d penguin amplitude, and the phase of Bd-Bd(bar) mixing. In order to make such
a comparison, we require one piece of theoretical input, which we take to be a
prediction for |P/T|, the relative size of the penguin and tree contributions
to Bd -> pi^+ pi^-. If independent knowledge of \alpha is available, the decay
Bd(t) -> pi^+ pi^- alone can be used to search for new physics. If a full
isospin analysis can be done, then new physics can be found solely through
measurements of B -> pi pi decays. The most promising scenario occurs when the
isospin analysis can be combined with independent knowledge of \alpha. In all
cases, the prospects for detecting new physics in B -> pi pi decays can be
greatly improved with the help of additional measurements which will remove
discrete ambiguities.

the leading order Isgur-Wise function of the Lambda_b -> Lambda_c transition in
terms of the corresponding B -> D,D^* mesonic Isgur-Wise function. Using
experimental data for the B -> D,D^* mesonic Isgur-Wise functions this bound is
established. Applying a QCD sum rule estimate of the Lambda_b -> Lambda_c
transition form factor which satisfy the spectator quark model bound we predict
the exclusive/inclusive ratio of semileptonic Lambda_b decay rates to lie in a
range between 0.81 and 0.89. We also provide an upper bound on the baryonic
Isgur-Wise function which is determined from the requirement that the exclusive
rate should not exceed the inclusive rate. Our pre-Osaka results are discussed

Ismail's argument to an A_n q-binomial theorem of Milne and derive a new A_n
generalization of Ramanujan's 1-psi-1 summation theorem. From this new A_n
1-psi-1 summation and from an A_n 1-psi-1 summation of Gustafson we deduce two
lemmas for deriving simple A_n generalizations of bilateral basic
hypergeometric series identities. These lemmas are closely related to the
Macdonald identities for A_n. As samples for possible applications of these
lemmas, we provide several A_n extensions of Bailey's 2-psi-2 transformations,
and several A_n extensions of a particular 2-psi-2 summation.

the quotient of the exterior algebra \E on \A by the ideal \I generated by

quotient of \E by the ideal generated by the degree-two component of \I. We
introduce the notion of \nbb set in $G$, determined by a linear order on \A,
and show that the corresponding monomials are linearly independent in the
quadratic closure $\bar{A}(G)$. As a consequence, $A(G)$ is a quadratic algebra
only if $G$ is line-closed. An example of S.~Yuzvinsky proves the converse
false. These results generalize to the degree $r$ closure of $\A(G)$.
  The motivation for studying line-closed matroids grew out of the study of
formal arrangements. This is a geometric condition necessary for \A to be free
and for the complement $M$ of \A to be a $K(\pi,1)$ space. Formality of \A is
also necessary for $A(G)$ to be a quadratic algebra. We clarify the
relationship between formality, line-closure, and other matroidal conditions
related to formality. We give examples to show that line-closure of $G$ is not
necessary or sufficient for $M$ to be a $K(\pi,1)$, or for \A to be free.

variance is quite large for heterodyne measurements, however it is possible to
reduce it to the theoretical limit of log(n)/(4n^2) using adaptive
measurements. These measurements are quite sensitive to experimental
inaccuracies, especially time delays and inefficient detectors. Here it is
shown that the minimum introduced phase variance when there is a time delay of
tau is tau/(8n). This result is verified numerically, showing that the phase
variance introduced approaches this limit for most of the adaptive schemes
using the best final phase estimate. The main exception is the adaptive mark II
scheme with simplified feedback, which is extremely sensitive to time delays.
The extra phase variance due to time delays is considered for the mark I case
