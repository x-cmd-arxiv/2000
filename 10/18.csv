integrated near-UV and far-UV magnitudes, and have combined these data with H
alpha, far-infrared, and thermal radio continuum measurements to explore the
consistency of UV and H alpha star formation rates (SFRs). In agreement with
previous studies, we find that the UV and H alpha SFRs are qualitatively
consistent, even before corrections for extinction are applied. The uncorrected
UV SFRs are systematically lower by a factor of 1.5 (with a factor of two
scatter) among luminous galaxies with SFRs over 1 solar mass per year,
indicating a higher effective attenuation of the far-UV radiation. Among less
luminous galaxies there is no significant offset between the H alpha and far-UV
SFR scales. Far-infrared and thermal radio continuum data available for a
subset of our sample allow us to estimate the attenuation in the UV and at H
alpha independently. The UV and H alpha attenuations appear to be correlated,
and confirm systematically higher attenuations in the UV. Although the galaxies
in our sample show modest levels of attenuation (with median values of 0.9 mag
at H alpha and 1.4 mag at 1550 Angstroms), the range across the sample is
large, around 4 mag for H alpha and around 5 mag in the far-UV (1550
Angstroms). This indicates that the application of a single characteristic
extinction correction to H alpha or UV SFRs is only realistic for large,
well-defined and well-studied galaxy samples, and that extinction bias may be
important for UV or emission-line selected samples of star-forming galaxies.

fundamental aspect of the Hubble galaxy classification system. This ``tuning
fork'' view was revised by de Vaucouleurs, whose classification volume
recognized apparent ``bar strength'' (SA, SAB, SB) as a continuous property of
galaxies called the ``family''. However, the SA, SAB, and SB families are
purely visual judgments that can have little bearing on the actual bar strength
in a given galaxy. Until very recently, published bar judgments were based
exclusively on blue light images, where internal extinction or star formation
can either mask a bar completely or give the false impression of a bar in a
nonbarred galaxy. Near-infrared camera arrays, which principally trace the old
stellar populations in both normal and barred galaxies, now facilitate a
quantification of bar strength in terms of their gravitational potentials and
force fields. In this paper, we show that the maximum value, Qb, of the ratio
of the tangential force to the mean radial force is a quantitative measure of
the strength of a bar. Qb does not measure bar ellipticity or bar shape, but
rather depends on the actual forcing due to the bar embedded in its disk. We
show that a wide range of true bar strengths characterizes the category ``SB'',
while de Vaucouleurs category ``SAB'' corresponds to a much narrower range of
bar strengths. We present Qb values for 36 galaxies, and we incorporate our bar
classes into a dust-penetrated classification system for spiral galaxies.

extragalactic absorption components along the sight line, this spectrum
provides a good opportunity to demonstrate the ability of FUSE to do both
interstellar and extragalactic science. Although the spectrum of PG0804+761 is
dominated by strong absorption from local Galactic gas, we concentrate our
study on absorption by molecular hydrogen and neutral neutral and ionized
metals related to an intermediate-velocity cloud in the lower Galactic halo at
-55 km/s, and on absorption from OVI extended to negative velocities. In the
IVC, weak molecular hydrogen absorption is found in 5 lines for rotational
levels 0 and 1, leading to a total H_2 column density of log N = 14.71(+-0.30).
We derive an OI gas-phase abundance for the IVC of 1.03(+0.71-0.42) solar.
Absorption by OVI is found at velocities as negative as -110 km/s, but no
absorption from any species is found at velocities of -180 km/ where absorption
from the nearby high-velocity Complex A would be expected. We suggest that the
extended OVI absorption traces hot gas above the Perseus spiral arm. Finally,
we find intergalactic absorption by an intervening HI Ly betax absorber at
z=0.019 and absorption by HI, CIII and OVI in an associated system at z=0.102.

models of Gaussian spectral line profiles. The most significant innovations of
this paper are: i) the normalization of the SCF based on an analytic model for
the effect of noise; ii) the computation of the SCF as a function of the
spatial lag between spectra within a map. By computing of the dependence of the
SCF on the spatial lag, S_o(dr), we have been able to conclude that: 1) S_o(dr)
is a power law, with slope in the range of scales l_i-l_o. 2) The correlation
outer scale, l_o, is determined by the size of the map, and no evidence for a
true departure from self-similarity on large scales has been found. 3) The
correlation inner scale, l_i, is a true estimate of the smallest self-similar
scale in a map. 4) The spectral slope in a given region, is independent of
velocity resolution (above a minimum resolution threshold), spatial resolution,
and average spectrum quality. 5) Molecular transitions which trace higher gas
density yield larger values of the spectral slope than transitions tracing
lower gas density. 6) Nyquist sampling, bad pixels in detector arrays, and
reference sharing data acquisition need to be taken into account for a correct
determination of the SCF at lag dr=1. The value of the spectral slope, however,
can be computed correctly without a detailed knowledge of observational
procedures.

intergalactic medium (IGM). We also include X-rays from point sources
associated with galaxies in the simulation, and make maps of the angular
distribution of the emission. We find that filaments in the maps are not
evident, being diluted by projection. In the soft (0.5-2 keV) band, the mean
intensity of radiation from intergalactic and cluster gas is 2.3*10^-12
ergdeg^-2cm^-2s^-1, 35% of the total soft band emission. This is compatible at
the ~1 sigma level with estimates of the unresolved soft background from ROSAT
and {\it Chandra}. Only 4% of the hard (2-10 keV) emission is associated with
the IGM. Relative to AGN flux, the IGM component peaks at a lower redshift
(median z~0.45) so its clustering makes an important contribution to that of
the total XRB. The angular correlations on 0.1-10 arcmin scales are
significant, with an amplitude roughly consistent with an extrapolation of
recent ROSAT results to small scales. A cross-correlation of the XRB against
nearby galaxies taken from a simulated redshift survey also yields a strong
signal from the IGM. Although some recent papers have argued that the expected
soft band intensity from gas in galaxy, group, and cluster halos would exceed
XRB limits unless much of the gas is expelled by supernova feedback, we obtain
reasonable compatibility with current observations in a simulation that
incorporates cooling, star formation, and only modest feedback. A prediction of
our model is that the unresolved portion of the soft XRB will remain mostly
unresolved.

quiescent state. We use the observed luminosities $L$ of accreting neutron
stars (R=10^6 cm) in soft X-ray transients and white dwarfs (R=10^9 cm) in
similar cataclysmic variables, and estimate M^dot in each system through the
relation L=(GM/R)*M^dot, where M is the mass of the star. From the available

radiatively inefficient accretion flows that either are convective or lose mass
via a wind.

"astro-ph/0010354","Pieter C. van der Kruit","P.C. van der Kruit","Truncations in stellar disks","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The presence of radial truncations in stellar disks is reviewed. There is
ample evidence that many disk galaxies have relatively shaprt truncations in
their disks. These often are symmetric and independent of the wavelength band
of the observations. The ratio of the truncation radius R_{max} to the disk
scalelength h appears often less then 4.5, as expected on a simple model for
the disk collapse. Current samples of galaxies observed may however not be
representative and heavily biased towards disks with the largest scalelengths.
Many spiral galaxies also have HI warps and these generally start at the
truncation radius of the stellar disk. The HI surface density suddenly becomes
much flatter with radius. In some galaxies the start of the warp and the
position of the disk truncation radius is accompanied by a drop in the rotation
velocity. In the regiosn beyond the dis truncation in the HI layer some star
formation does occur, but the heavy element abundance and the dust content are
very low. All evidence is consistent with the notion that the outer gas parts
of the disks constitute recently accreted material, at least accreted after
formation of what is now the stellar thin disk. Although various models exist
for the origin of the truncations in the stellar disks, this at present remains
unclear.

The latter shows a prominent (~18arcsec) soft ``plume'' in the N-W direction,
coincident with the [OIII] ionization cone. The radial profiles of the
brightest X-ray source at various energies are consistent with an unresolved
(FWHM ~0.8arcsec) component, which we identify as the active nucleus, plus two
extended components with FWHMs ~ 2.3arcsec and 18arcsec, respectively. In a
radius of 3arcsec, the nucleus contributes roughly the same flux as the
extended components at the softest energies (< 2 keV). However, at harder

where the degeneracy for a longitudinal field of wavelength $\lambda$ is
$(\frac {1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^{2N/\lambda}$ for a system with $N$ spins, an exact
result obtained from the known result for $\lambda =2$. The phase transitions

We find that for all the phase transition points obtained in this way, $\Delta

the universality class of the two dimensional Ising model. The longitudinal

field, which seems to be a unique feature for the competing field. The phase
boundaries for two different wavelengths of the modulated field are obtained.
Close to the multiphase point at $h_c$, the phase boundary behaves as $(h_c -
h_0)^b$, where $b$ is also $\lambda$ dependent.

side), the average energy of the dominantly $\bar{\nu}_e$ events is already
lower than the theoretical expectations, which would get aggravated by a
complete conversion from $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ to $\bar{\nu}_e$. If taken seriously,
the LSND data are disfavored independent of the existence of a sterile
neutrino. A possible remedy is CPT violation, which allows different mass
spectra for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and hence can accommodate atmospheric,
solar and LSND data without a sterile neutrino. If this is the case, Mini-BooNE
must run in $\bar{\nu}$ rather than the planned $\nu$ mode to test the LSND
signal. We speculate on a possible origin of CPT violation.

boundary conditions now follow from the field equations, which are obtained by
letting the induced metric vary on the boundary. This approach gives similar
modes that are obtained in [1] and clarifies the complementarity of the RS and
the AdS/CFT pictures. Normalizability of these modes is checked by an
inner-product in the space of linearized perturbations. The same conclusions
hold for a massless scalar field in the bulk.

compactified on $T^4$. In this model it is possible to make $T^4$
noncommutative and it is easy to turn on all 6 components of the
noncommutativity on $T^4$. The action of S-duality on the noncommutativity
parameters is also manifest. The M(atrix)-model is given by the large $N$ limit
of a $\sigma$-model on $T^2$ whose target space is the moduli space of $k$
SU(N) instantons on $T^3\times R$. We also propose that the $SU(k)$ 2+1D
$Spin(8)$ theory (the low-energy description of $k$ M2-branes) on $T^3$
corresponds to the large $N$ limit of an integral over the latter instanton
moduli space. The identification is based on the fact that Euclidean wrapped
M2-branes in toroidally compactified M-theory correspond to instantons in the
M(atrix)-model. In the new M(atrix) models, operators with nonzero momentum
along $T^3$ (or $T^4$) correspond to insertions of Wilson lines along a 1-cycle
that is determined by the momentum. Momentum is conserved in the large $N$

include direct ${e^{+}e^{-}}$ decays of the vector mesons $\rho ^{0}$, $\omega

$-, and $\phi $-mesons, and of the baryon resonances $% \Delta (1232),N(1520),$
$... $ . The subthreshold vector meson production cross sections in $pp$
collisions are treated in a way sufficient to avoid double counting with the
inclusive vector meson production. The vector meson dominance model for the
transition form factors of the resonance Dalitz decays $R\to e^{+}e^{-}N$ is
used in an extended form to ensure correct asymptotics which are in agreement
with the quark counting rules. Such a modification gives an unified and
consistent description of both $R\to N\gamma $ radiative decays and $R\to N\rho
(\omega)$ meson decays.
  The effect of multiple pion production on the experimental efficiency for the
detection of the dilepton pairs is studied. We find the dilepton yield in
reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the set of intermediate
energies whereas at the highest energy $T_{lab}=4.88$ GeV the number of
dilepton pairs is likely to be overestimated experimentally in the mass range
$M=300\div 700$ MeV.

latest phase shift analyzes SP00, SM00 and FA00 by Arndt {\em et al.} as input

imaginary parts of the interaction account for loss of flux into direct or
resonant production processes. For a study of resonances and absorption the
partial waves wave functions with physical boundary conditions are calculated.
We display the energy and radial dependences of flux losses and radial
probabilities. The results lend quantitative support for the established mental
image of intermediate elementary particle formation in the spirit of fusion.

fluctuating environments, and develop techniques that allow us to expand the
formal solution of the evolution equations to first order in the mutation rate.
Our method can be applied to both discrete time and continuous time systems.
While the behavior of continuous time systems is dominated by the average
fitness landscape for small mutation rates, in discrete time systems it is
instead the geometric mean fitness that determines the system's properties. In
both cases, we find that in situations in which the arithmetic (resp.
geometric) mean of the fitness landscape is degenerate, regions in which the
fitness fluctuates around the mean value present a selective advantage over
regions in which the fitness stays at the mean. This effect is caused by the
vanishing genetic diffusion at low mutation rates. In the absence of strong
diffusion, a population can stay close to a fluctuating peak when the peak's
height is below average, and take advantage of the peak when its height is
above average.

involves standard spin-1/2 projections and measurements of the position and the
momentum of the harmonic oscillator system, which for a light mode can be
realized by means of homodyne detection. We discuss effects of imperfections,
including non-unit efficiency of the homodyne detector, and point out a close
