field in terms of angular power spectra and cross correlation of the two shear

can be used to monitor unknown sources of noise in the data. The power spectra
are decomposed in a model independent manner in terms of ``band-powers'' which
are then extracted from the data using a quadratic estimator to find the
maximum of the likelihood and its local curvature (for error estimates). We
test the method against simulated data from Gaussian realizations and
cosmological N-body simulations. In the Gaussian case, the mean bandpowers and
their covariance are well recovered even for irregular (or sparsely) sampled
fields. The mild non-Gaussianity of the N-body realizations causes a slight
underestimation of the errors that becomes negligible for scales much larger
than several arcminutes and does not bias the recovered band powers.

distinct from a late-type population infalling from the Pisces-Perseus

galaxies whose velocity dispersion distinguishes them from both the early and
late-type galaxies. We supplement our investigation with an analysis of
archival X-ray data. A temperature is determined using ASCA GIS data and a gas
profile is derived from ROSAT HRI data. The increased statistics of our sample
results in a picture of A262 with significant differences from earlier work. A
previously proposed solution to the ""beta-problem"" in A262 in which the gas
temperature is significantly higher than the galaxy temperature is shown to
result from using too low a velocity dispersion for the early-type galaxies.
Our data present a consistent picture of A262 in which there is no

There is no longer any requirement for extensive galaxy-gas feedback to
drastically overheat the gas with respect to the galaxies. We also demonstrate

a calculated magnetic helicity current. In this model the fluid helicity plays
a small role in large scale magnetic field generation. Instead, the dynamo
process is dominated by a new quantity, derived from asymmetries in the second
derivative of the velocity correlation function, closely related to the `twist
and fold' dynamo model. The turbulent damping term is, as expected, almost
unchanged. Numerical simulations with a spatially constant fluid helicity and
vanishing resistivity are not expected to generate large scale fields in
equipartition with the turbulent energy density. The prospects for driving a
fast dynamo under these circumstances are uncertain, but if it is possible,
then the field must be largely force-free. On the other hand, there is an
efficient analog to the $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo. Systems whose turbulence is
driven by some anisotropic local instability in a shearing flow, like real
stars and accretion disks, and some computer simulations, may successfully
drive the generation of strong large scale magnetic fields, provided that
$\partial_r\Omega< \partial_\theta v_z\omega_\theta>>0$. We show that this

spatially coherent vertical magnetic helicity current with the same sign as
$-\partial_r\Omega$, that is, positive for an accretion disk and negative for
the Sun. We comment on the role of random magnetic helicity currents in storing
turbulent energy in a disordered magnetic field, which will generate an

the ratio of the IRAS 60 micron band flux to the 100 micron band flux,
R(60/100). This is in contrast to the drop in the [CII]/FIR ratio with
increasing R(60/100), which signal higher dust temperatures and more intense
radiation fields. We interpret the stable [CII]/AFE ratio as evidence that gas
heating is dominated by the PAHs or small grains which are also AFE carriers
over a wide range of conditions. The trend of decreasing [CII]/FIR with

relatively X-ray faint systems, integrated X-ray emission from discrete
stellar-like sources is thought to be considerable, although the amount of the
contribution is controversial. To help resolve this issue, we examine the
radial X-ray surface brightness distribution of 17 X-ray faint galaxies
observed with the ROSAT HRI and PSPC. We assume that the stellar contribution
follows a de Vaucouleurs law while the hot gas component follows a King beta
model. For some galaxies, both models fit equally well, but for a number of
systems, a dual component model yields the best fit, from which upper bounds
are placed on the stellar contribution. Best-fit values for the stellar
contribution are inconsistent with (lower than) that suggested by Fabbiano,
Gioia, & Trinchieri (1989) and estimated from the bulge of M31, but are
consistent with the Forman, Jones, & Tucker (1985) estimate of the stellar
fraction in X-ray faint elliptical and S0 galaxies. Our results indicate an
upper limit to discrete sources of L_X/L_B = 1.6 x 10^29 ergs/s/L(solar).

misinterpreted as coming from additional physically distinct nuclear
components. We illustrate this phenomenon for the case of a thin disc in
circular motion around a nuclear black hole (BH). We develop a new method for
estimating the mass of the BH that exploits a feature in the spectrum at the
outer edge of the BH's sphere of influence, and therefore gives higher
sensitivity to BH detection than traditional methods. Moreover, with this
method we can determine the black hole mass and the inclination of the
surrounding disc separately, whereas the traditional approach to black-hole
estimation requires two long-slit spectra to be taken. We show that with a
given spectrograph, the detectability of a BH depends on the sense of rotation
of the nuclear disc. We apply our method to estimate the BH mass in M84 from a
publicly available spectrum, and recover a value 4 times lower than that
published previously from the same data.

within a radius of ~60' from M87 is characterized by an ICM temperature of kT
\~2.5 keV with little variation. On the other hand, the outer regions indicate
significant variation of the temperature with an amplitude of about 1 keV. The
temperature map was produced from the hardness ratio (H.R.) values with a
resolution of about 5'. Besides the previously reported hot region with kT > 4
keV between M87 and M49, several hot regions with kT = 3-4 keV are detected in
the cluster outskirts. The auto-correlation function for the H.R. variation
shows that the temperature variation is correlated within a size of about 300
kpc, suggesting that gas blobs falling in the Virgo cluster have a typical size
of groups of galaxies. A correlation with the velocity dispersion of member
galaxies shows that only the north-west region indicates an unusually large

the Virgo cluster is obtained to be L_X ~9 x 10^41 ergs/s in the 2 - 10 keV

from its central star by collimation of an asymmetric stellar wind in a pair of
conical shocks seen in Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2) images. The jets
consist of several pairs of knots symmetrically distributed with respect to the
central star, with most knots exhibiting a head-tail morphology. Large (up to
650 km/s) radial velocity gradients are seen within the knots on subarcsec
scales, with velocities decreasing from the knot heads toward their trailing
tails. These large velocity gradients are a sign of efficient deceleration of
jets by a much slower bipolar outflow. The inclination angle of the bipolar
outflow is equal to 40 degrees, based on Doppler shifts of the scattered
stellar Halpha line. Its velocity is equal to 140 km/s at a distance of 0.23 pc
from the star, and increases monotonically with the radial distance from the

shear is a non-local function of the lensing mass, reconstructions that use
shear information can successfully bridge small gaps in observations. For our
simulations we use a mass density distribution that is realistic for a z=0.4
cluster of total mass around 10^15 h^-1 M_solar. Using HST-quality shear data
alone, covering the area of four WFPC2 observations, we detect 60 per cent of
the mass of the cluster within the area observed, despite the mass sheet
degeneracy. This is qualitatively because the shear provides information about
the variations in the mass distribution, and our prior includes a positivity
constraint. We investigate the effect of using various sizes of observing field
and find that 50 to 100 per cent of the cluster mass is detected, depending on
the observing strategy and cluster shape. Finally we demonstrate how this

in the normal state and in the superconducting state. In particular, we pay
atte ntion to the pseudogap in the normal state and the phase transition from

  The pseudogap phenomena observed in cuprates are naturally understood as a
precursor of the strong coupling superconductivity. We have previously show n
by using the self-consistent T-matrix calculation that the pseudogap is a resu
lt of the strong superconducting fluctuations which are accompanied by the
stron g coupling superconductivity in quasi-two dimensional systems [J. Phys.

  We extend the scenario to the superconducting state. The close relation
between the pseudogap state and the superconducting state is pointed out. Once
t he superconducting phase transition occurs, the superconducting order
parameter rapidly grows rather than the result of BCS theory. With the rapid
growth of the order parameter, the gap structure becomes sharp, while it is
remarkably broad in the pseudogap state. The characteristic energy scale of the
gap does not chan ge. These results well explain the phase transition observed
in the spectroscopi c measurements.

scatter ing, the optical conductivity and the London penetration depth is

that time reversal symmetry is broken either by an external magnetic field or,
as in the case of a delta-correlated random magnetic field, by the disorder
itself, we derive a supermatrix $\sigma $-model. As an intermediate step, we
provide a microscopic derivation of the ballistic $\sigma$-model, and find that
certain corrections to its usual form may become important. We then integrate
out degrees of freedom corresponding to short length scales to derive a
low-energy supermatrix $\sigma $-model. We find an extra term in the free
energy that couples to the correlator of local currents. Use of a proper
ultraviolet regularisation procedure that preserves gauge invariance indicates
that the contribution of the extra term seems finally to become irrelevant.
Within the scope of our analyis, we therefore do not find any deviation of the
scaling behaviour of the delta-correlated random magnetic field model from that
of the conventional unitary ensemble. We then generalize the discussion to
include models of even longer-ranged disorder, plus short-range disorder. When
the disorder is sufficiently long-ranged that the local currents become
delta-correlated, a new term appears in the free energy that does give rise to
logarithmic corrections to the conductivity. A renormalisation group analysis
of the free energy yields a scaling form for the diffusion coefficient which
contains both a positive correction, that represents classical superdiffusion,
and a negative correction, which is the usual weak localization correction. The
fact that both corrections are of the same order and opposite sign leads to the
interesting possibility of a quantum phase transition at weak disorder in two
dimensions, tuned by the relative disorder strengths.

the spin correlation decays either algebraically or exponentially. We show that
the gapless chiral phase appears in a broad region of the phase diagram for
general S. By contrast, the gapped chiral phase is found for integer S in a
narrow region of the phase diagram, while it has not been identified for
half-odd integer S within our numerical accuracy. By combining the results with
our previous result for S = 1, we discuss the S-dependence of the phase
diagram. The prediction from a bosonization analysis on the decay exponent of
the spin correlation is verified.

optimal compromise between these needs. Several possible oligon lengths are

proposed, which seek to extract information useful for program optimization.
Although motivated by practical considerations, notably making Prolog
competitive with imperative languages, such frameworks fail to capture some of

  In this paper we propose a novel framework for the abstract interpretation of
Prolog which handles the depth-first search rule and the cut operator. It
relies on the notion of substitution sequence to model the result of the
execution of a goal. The framework consists of (i) a denotational concrete
semantics, (ii) a safe abstraction of the concrete semantics defined in terms
of a class of post-fixpoints, and (iii) a generic abstract interpretation
algorithm. We show that traditional abstract domains of substitutions may
easily be adapted to the new framework, and provide experimental evidence of
the effectiveness of our approach. We also show that previous work on
determinacy analysis, that was not expressible by existing abstract
interpretation frameworks, can be seen as an instance of our framework.

utilization of general formalism developed earlier. The complete exact solution
of the model problem describing equilibrium dynamics of train tracks on the
punctured torus is obtained. Being guided by similarities between the dynamics
of 2d liquid crystals and 2+1 gravity the partition function for gravity is
mapped into that for the Farey spin chain. The Farey spin chain partition
function, fortunately, is known exactly and has been thoroughly investigated
recently. Accordingly, the transition between the pseudo-Anosov and the
periodic dynamic regime (in Thurston's terminology) in the case of gravity is
being reinterpreted in terms of phase transitions in the Farey spin chain whose
partition function is just a ratio of two Riemann zeta functions. The mapping
into the spin chain is facilitated by recognition of a special role of the
Alexander polynomial for knots/links in study of dynamics of self
homeomorphisms of surfaces. At the end of paper, using some facts from the
theory of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds (initiated by Bianchi in 1892), we
develop systematic extension of the obtained results to noncompact Riemannian
surfaces of higher genus. Some of the obtained results are also useful for 3+1
gravity. In particular, using the theorem of Margulis, we provide new reasons
for the black hole existence in the Universe: black holes make our Universe

provided. The greater night flux in nu_e is seen to be a consequence of the
fact that the matter effect in the sun and that in the earth have the same
sign. It is shown in the adiabatic approximation for the sun that for all
values of the mixing angle theta_V between 0 and pi/2, the night flux of
neutrinos is greater than the day flux. Only for small values of theta_V where
the adiabatic approximation badly fails does the sign of the day-night

metric and a trace-free second fundamental form. Conversely, such a data on the
3-sphere is the boundary of a unique selfdual conformal metric, defined in a
neighborhood of the sphere. In this paper we characterize the conformal metrics
and trace-free second fundamental forms on the 3-sphere (close to the standard
round metric) which are boundaries of selfdual conformal metrics on the whole
4-ball.
  When the data on the boundary is reduced to a conformal metric (the
trace-free part of the second fundamental form vanishes), one may hope to find
in the conformal class of the filling metric an Einstein metric, with a pole of
order 2 on the boundary. We determine which conformal metrics on the 3-sphere
are boundaries of such selfdual Einstein metrics on the 4-ball. In particular,
this implies the Positive Frequency Conjecture of LeBrun.
  The proof uses twistor theory, which enables to translate the problem in
terms of complex analysis; this leads us to prove a criterion for certain
integrable CR structures of signature (1,1) to be fillable by a complex domain.
  Finally, we solve an analogous, higher dimensional problem: selfdual Einstein
metrics are replaced by quaternionic-Kahler metrics, and conformal structures
on the boundary by quaternionic contact structures (previously introduced by
the author); in contrast with the 4-dimensional case, we prove that any small

stationary cellular flow, stationary shear flow, and percolating flow.
Production terms of Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov type and of Arrhenius
type are considered under the assumption of no feedback of the concentration on
the velocity. Numerical simulations of advection-reaction-diffusion equations
have been performed by an algorithm based on discrete-time maps. The results
show a generic enhancement of the speed of front propagation by the underlying
flow. For small molecular diffusivity, the front speed $V_f$ depends on the
typical flow velocity $U$ as a power law with an exponent depending on the
topological properties of the flow, and on the ratio of reactive and advective
time-scales. For open-streamline flows we find always $V_f \sim U$, whereas for
cellular flows we observe $V_f \sim U^{1/4}$ for fast advection, and $V_f \sim
U^{3/4}$ for slow advection.

cooperative existence of fluctuations ranging in size from millimetres to
thousands of kilometres are found to exhibit long-range spacial and temporal
correlations. These correlations are manifested as the self-similar fractal
geometry of the global cloud cover pattern and the inverse power-law form for
the atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Such long-range spaciotemporal
correlations are ubiquitous in extended natural dynamical systems and are
signatures of deterministic chaos or self-organized criticality. In this paper,
a cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows is developed by
consideration of microscopic domain eddy dynamical processes. This
nondeterministic model enables formulation of a simple closed set of governing
equations for the prediction and description of observed atmospheric flow
structure characteristics as follows. The strange-attractor design of the field
of deterministic chaos in atmospheric flows consists of a nested continuum of
logarithmic spiral circulations that trace out the quasi-periodic Penrose
tiling pattern, identified as the quasi-crystalline structure in condensed
matter physics. The atmospheric eddy energy structure follows laws similar to
quantum mechanical laws. The apparent wave-particle duality that characterize
quantum mechanical laws is attributed to the bimodal phenomenological form of
energy display in the bidirectional energy flow that is intrinsic to eddy
circulations, e.g., formation of clouds in updrafts and dissipation of clouds
in downdrafts that result in the observed discrete cellular geometry of cloud
structure.

phase shift in a three-level system where states are invariant under a
non-Abelian group. In contrast to existing experiments and proposals for
experiments, based on U(1)-invariant states, our scheme geodesically evolves
U(2)-invariant states in a four-dimensional SU(3)/U(2) space and is physically
realized via a three-channel optical interferometer.

parameters in quantum mechanics is surveyed. It is shown that the algebraic
formulation of quantum mechanics permits introduction of a specific hidden
parameter, which has the form of nonlinear functional on the algebra of
observables. It is found out that the reasoning of von Neumann and of Bell
about incompatibility of quantum mechanics with hidden parameters is
inapplicable to the present case.

transmission of information, even if most general local operations are allowed,
as long as they are linear and trace preserving. In particular, any quantum
mechanical approximate cloning transformation does not allow signalling. On the
other hand, the no-signalling constraint on its own is not sufficient to
prevent a transformation from surpassing the known cloning bounds. We
illustrate these concepts on the basis of some examples.
