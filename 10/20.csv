matter (CDM) theory and observations of clustering on sub-galactic scales. Warm
dark matter (WDM) is a simple modification of CDM in which the dark matter
particles have initial velocities due either to their having decoupled as
thermal relics, or having been formed via non-equilibrium decay. We investigate
the nonlinear gravitational clustering of WDM with a high resolution N-body
code, and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative
to CDM, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are
increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low mass satellites. The
number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by `top down'
fragmentation of caustics, as part of a `cosmic web' connecting massive halos.
Few small halos form outside this web. If we identify small halos with dwarf
galaxies, their number, spatial distribution, and formation epoch appear in
better agreement with the observations for WDM than they are for CDM.

observations of the 21-hr low mass X-ray binary X1624-490, showing five complex
dips in unprecedented detail. For the first time, dipping is detected up to 15
keV. Prominent flares are also observed in the light curves, limited to
energies above 8 keV. Spectra selected by intensity during dip episodes can be
well fit with a two-component model consisting of a point-like blackbody from
the neutron star and progressive covering of an extended Comptonized region,
presumably an accretion disk corona (ADC), corrected for photons scattered into

regions of the absorber are highly ionized and that electron scattering is
totally responsible for the X-ray attenuation during shallow dipping. The
timescales of dip ingress and egress indicate that the envelope of material
absorbing the ADC has smaller angular size than the ADC itself, and that the

mass accretion or a change in the high-density equation of state. We consider
the possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is
still measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the
supernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\lesssim 0.5$ ms).
The properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important
measures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron
star. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the
cutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent
time-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole
formation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\sim 1$) seconds after core
collapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s
per flavor. In this case, the neutrino mass sensitivity can be extraordinary.
For a supernova at a distance $D = 10$ kpc, SuperKamiokande can detect a
$\bar{\nu}_e$ mass down to 1.8 eV by comparing the arrival times of the
high-energy and low-energy neutrinos in $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$. This
test will also measure the cutoff time, and will thus allow a mass test of
$\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ relative to $\bar{\nu}_e$. Assuming that $\nu_\mu$ and
$\nu_\tau$ are nearly degenerate, as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino
results, masses down to about 6 eV can be probed with a proposed lead detector
of mass $M_D = 4$ kton (OMNIS). Remarkably, the neutrino mass sensitivity
scales as $(D/L_{BH} M_D)^{1/2}$. Therefore, {\it direct} sensitivity to all
three neutrino masses in the interesting few-eV range is realistically
possible; {\it there are no other known techniques that have this capability}.

depths. The 1612- and 1720-MHz line-profiles showed conjugate behaviour whereby
one line was in absorption and the other in emission. In addition, the profiles
commonly showed a flip from absorption to emission and vice versa, which has

  To appear in The Astrophysical Journal, Vol 547, February 1, 2001 issue",,"10.1086/318390",,"astro-ph",,"  The absence of radio pulsars with long periods has lead to the popular notion
of a high P ``death line.'' In the standard picture, beyond this boundary,
pulsars with low spin rates cannot accelerate particles above the stellar
surface to high enough energies to initiate pair cascades, and the pair
creation needed for radio emission is strongly suppressed. In this paper we
explore the possibility of another pulsar ``death line'' in the context of
polar cap models, corresponding to high magnetic fields B in the upper portion
of the period-period derivative diagram, a domain where few radio pulsars are
observed. The origin of this high B boundary, which may occur when B becomes
comparable to or exceeds $B_{\rm cr} = 4.4 \times 10^{13}$ Gauss, is also due
to the suppression of magnetic pair creation, but primarily because of
ineffective competition with magnetic photon splitting. Threshold pair creation
also plays a prominent role in the suppression of cascades. We present Monte
Carlo calculations of the pair yields in photon splitting/pair cascades which
show that, in the absence of scattering effects, pair production is effectively
suppressed, but only if all three modes of photon splitting allowed by QED are
operating in high fields. This paper describes the probable shape and position
of the new ``death line,'' above which pulsars are expected to be radio quiet,
but perhaps still X-ray and gamma-ray bright. The hypothesized existence of
radio-quiet sources finds dramatic support in the recent discovery of
ultra-strong fields in Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars.
Guidelines for moderate to high B pulsar searches at radio wavelengths and also
in the soft and hard gamma-ray bands are presented.

of fluctuations, at all epochs the stellar populations in spiral bulges should
be older and redder than those in typical ellipticals selected at the same
redshift. To test this simple prediction, we analyze the internal optical
colors of a complete sample of I<24 mag early-type and spiral galaxies from the
Northern and Southern Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). The subset of galaxies in the
Northern HDF are also investigated in the near-infrared using NICMOS
photometry. We compare the central (inner 5% radius) colors of those spirals
with clearly visible bulges with the integrated colors of ellipticals in our
sample. Comparisons are possible to a redshift z~1 at which point well-defined
bulges become difficult to locate. While spiral bulges are systematically
redder in their optical colors than their associated disks at all redshifts, we
find that the majority are significantly bluer than the red locus occupied by
most field ellipticals at similar redshifts. In the near-infrared, similar
trends are found at redshifts z<0.6, but at higher redshifts some bulges as red
as the reddest ellipticals are found. We conclude that a significant
rejuvenation may have occurred in the inner stellar populations of many spiral

loss more easily, but have short, relaxation-limited life-times. Pleiades-like

tidal radii and having large (1-2 pc) core-radii. A 'main-sequence' of clusters
is thus established. Ultimately, a cluster dies an explosive death through the
ever shortening relaxation time, and leaves a remnant that consists of about
4-10 stars arranged in a highly hierarchical and thus long-lived system.

outflows and display Herbig-Haro flows in the optical or near infrared
wavebands. 4/7 sources were detected, two of which are new discoveries in
systems of very low luminosity, one being the lowest luminosity system detected
to date in the cm continuum. Notably, three sources were not detected to a
3-sigma limit of 0.10 mJy/beam, which indicates that significant cm continuum
emission is not a universal feature of Class I systems with outflow activity.
Subsequent observations of HH30, a more evolved Class II system, found no
emission to a 3-sigma limit of 0.03 mJy/beam. After comparison with near
infrared data, we suggest that the discriminating feature of the detected
systems is a relatively high ionisation fraction in the stellar wind. Temporal
variability of the outflow may also play a role. The one relatively bright
source, IRAS 04016+2610 (L1489 IRS), is clearly resolved on a 0``.4 scale at 2
cm and 3.5 cm. Follow-up imaging with MERLIN did not detect this source with a
0``.04 beam, indicating that the radio emission is generated in a region with a
radius of about 25 au, which is broadly similar to the radius of the bipolar
cavities inferred from models of near infrared data. Interpretation of this
system is complicated by the existence of a quadrupolar outflow, which we
originally detected through polarimetric imaging. We present a near infrared H2
image in which a bow shock in the secondary outflow is clearly seen. This
complicated structure may have been caused by a gravitational interaction
between two protostars.

  We compare the observations with several GCE calculations, including existing
one-zone models, and a new model developed in the framework of inhomogeneous
evolution of the Galactic halo. We show that Li evolved at a constant rate
relative to iron throughout the halo and old-disk epochs, but that during the
formation of young-disk stars, the production of Li relative to iron increased
significantly. These observations can be understood in the context of models in
which post-primordial Li evolution during the halo and old-disk epochs is
dominated by Galactic cosmic ray fusion and spallation reactions, with some
contribution from the $\nu$-process in supernovae. The onset of more efficient
Li production (relative to iron) in the young disk coincides with the
appearance of Li from novae and AGB stars. The major challenge facing the
models is to reconcile the mild evolution of Li during the halo and old-disk
phases with the more efficient production (relative to iron) at [Fe/H] > -0.5.
We speculate that cool-bottom processing (production) of Li in low-mass stars
may provide an important late-appearing source of Li, without attendant Fe
production, that might explain the Li production in the young disk.

during the post-main-sequence evolution of a evolved mass donor, and/or (c) via
mixing during a mass-transfer event or stellar merger. The warmest Li-deficient
stars at the turnoff would be regarded as emerging ""canonical"" blue stragglers,
whereas cooler ones represent sub-turnoff-mass ""blue-stragglers-to-be."" The
latter are presently hidden on the main sequence, Li depletion being possibly
the clearest signature of their past history and future significance.
Eventually, the main sequence turnoff will reach down to their mass, exposing
those Li-depleted stars as canonical blue stragglers when normal stars of that
mass evolve away. Arguing against this unified view is the observation that the
three Li-depleted stars at Teff ~ 6300 K are all binaries, whereas very few of
the cooler systems show evidence for binarity; it is thus possible that two
separate mechanisms are responsible for the production of Li-deficient
main-sequence halo stars.

departures from standard recombination of the primeval plasma are parametrized
through a change in the fine structure constant $\alpha$ compared to its
present value. In addition to $\alpha$ we vary the baryon and dark matter
densities, the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, and the Hubble constant.
Within the class of models considered, the lack of a prominent second acoustic
peak in the measured spectrum can be accomodated either by a relatively large
baryon density, by a tilt towards the red in the spectrum of density
fluctuations, or by a delay in the time at which neutral hydrogen formed. The
ratio between the second and first peak decreases by around 25% either if the
baryon density $\Omega_bh^2$ is increased or the spectral index $n$ decreased
by a comparable amount, or if neutral hydrogen formed at a redshift $z_*$ about
15% smaller than its standard value. We find that the present data is best
fitted by a delay in recombination, with a lower baryon density than the best
fit if recombination is standard. Our best fit model has $z_*= 900$,

nearest-neighbor square lattice and decoupled chains via the isotropic
triangular lattice, it permits the study of competition between
antiferromagnetic and BCS Cooper instabilities. We begin by reproducing known
results for decoupled chains, and for the square lattice with only
nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude $t_1$. We examine both repulsive and
attractive Hubbard interactions. The role of formally irrelevant contributions
to the one-loop renormalization-group flows is also studied, and these
subleading contributions are shown to be important in some instances. We then
observe that crossover to a BCS-dominated regime can occur even at half-filling
when antiferromagnetism is frustrated through the introduction of a
next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude $t_2$ along one of the two diagonal
directions. Stripes are not expected to occur and time-reversal breaking
$d_{x^2 - y^2} \pm i d_{xy}$ superconducting order does not arise
spontaneously; instead pure $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ order is favored. At the isotropic
triangular point ($t_1 = t_2$) we find the possibility of re-entrant
antiferromagnetic long-range order.

weaker than the intralayer exchange, as suggested by experiment. We observe
this result independent of the number of layers in our model. We find evidence

frustration caused by nearest neighbor interactions in the mixed layer pnictide

strengths as a function of the width of the ring and the strength of the

the suppression of Aharonov-Bohm effect. The conditional probability
distribution calculated for the low-lying exction states allows identification
of the presence of Aharonov-Bohm effect. The linear optical susceptibility is
also calculated as a function of the magnetic field, to be confronted with the

an alternative explanation, I have considered an inhomogeneous barotropic
spherically symmetric spacetime. Obviously, in this inhomogeneous model the
philosophical cosmological principle is not verified. Within this framework,
the kinematical acceleration of the cosmic fluid or, equivalently, the
inhomogeneity of matter, is just the responsible of the SNe Ia measured cosmic
acceleration. Moreover, this model gives rise to a generalized Hubble law with
two anisotropic terms (dipole acceleration and quadrupole shear), besides the
expansion one. The dipole term of this generalized Hubble law could explain, in
a cosmological setting, the observed large scale flow of matter, without to
have recourse to peculiar velocity-type newtonian models which assume a Doppler
dipole.

Borel algebra U_q(B) is constructed. It gives the family U_qJ(B) of quantum
algebras depending on parameters x and h. In a generic point these algebras
represent the hybrid (standard-nonstandard) quantization. The quantum Jordanian
twist can be applied to the standard quantization of any Kac-Moody algebra. The
corresponding classical r-matrix is a linear combination of the Drinfeld- Jimbo
and the Jordanian ones. The obtained two-parametric families of Hopf algebras
are smooth and for the limit values of the parameters the standard and
nonstandard quantizations are recovered. The twisting element F_qJ also has the
correlated limits, in particular when q tends to unity it acquires the
canonical form of the Jordanian twist. To illustrate the properties of the
quantum Jordanian twist we construct the hybrid quantizations for U(sl(2)) and
for the corresponding affine algebra U(hat(sl(2))). The universal quantum
R-matrix and its defining representation are presented.

measurement is expected to be almost free of nuclear effects, which introduce a
significant uncertainty in the extraction of these two ratios from deep
inelastic scattering off the proton and deuteron. The results are expected to
test perturbative and non-perturbative mechanisms of spin-flavor symmetry
breaking in the nucleon, and constrain the structure function parameterizations
needed for the interpretation of high energy e-p, p-p and p-pbar collider data.
The precision of the expected data can also allow for testing competing
parameterizations of the nuclear EMC effect and provide valuable constraints on
models of its dynamical origin.
