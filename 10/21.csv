sources using three redshift surveys of flux-limited samples selected at low
(151 & 178 MHz) radio frequency, low-frequency source counts and the local RLF.
The redshift surveys used are the new 7C Redshift Survey (7CRS) and the
brighter 3CRR and 6CE surveys totalling 356 sources with virtually complete
redshift information. This yields unprecedented coverage of the radio
luminosity versus z plane for steep-spectrum sources, and hence the most
accurate measurements of the steep-spectrum RLF yet made. We find that a simple
dual-population model for the RLF fits the data well, requiring differential
density evolution (with z) for the two populations. The low-luminosity
population can be associated with radio galaxies with weak emission lines, and
includes sources with both FRI and FRII radio structures; its comoving space
density $\rho$ rises by about one dex between z~0 and z~1 but cannot yet be
meaningfully constrained at higher redshifts. The high-luminosity population
can be associated with FRII radio galaxies and quasars with strong emission
lines; its $\rho$ rises by nearly three dex between z~0 and z~2. These results
mirror the situation seen in X-ray and optically-selected AGN. The integrated
radio luminosity density of the combination of the two populations is
controlled by the value of $\rho$ at the low-luminosity end of the RLF of the
high-luminosity population, a quantity which has been directly measured at z~1
by the 7CRS. We argue that robust determination of this quantity at higher
redshifts requires a new redshift survey based on a large (~1000 source) sample
about five times fainter than the 7CRS.

of a much more stringent test: fitting spatially integrated ASCA GIS (0.6-8
keV) and RXTE PCA (3-10 keV) data with a combination of the synchrotron model
SRESC newly ported to XSPEC and a new thermal shock model VPSHOCK. The new
model can describe the continuum emission above 2 keV well, in both spatial
distribution and spectrum. We find that the emission is dominantly nonthermal,
with a small but noticeable thermal component: Mg and Si are clearly visible in
the integrated spectrum. The synchrotron component rolls off smoothly from the
extrapolated radio spectrum, with a characteristic rolloff frequency of 3.1E17
Hz, at which the spectrum has dropped about a factor of 6 below a powerlaw
extrapolation from the radio spectrum. Comparison of TeV observations with new
TeV model images and spectra based on the X-ray model fits gives a mean
post-shock magnetic field strength of about 9 microGauss, implying (for a
compression ratio of 4) an upstream magnetic field of 3 microGauss, and fixing
the current energy content in relativistic electrons at about 7E48 ergs,
resulting in a current electron-acceleration efficiency of about 5%. This total
energy is about 100 times the energy in the magnetic field. Our results

turbulent, with many absorption components distributed over approximately 270

relatively high for this redshift, Z(DLA) approximately 1/20 Z(solar). From
consideration of the relative ratios of elements which have different

in terms of the passage of active regions across the solar disk. In this case,
L remains essentially unchanged.
  For the total irradiance variation observed over the solar cycle, the issue
is more uncertain. One view explains this modulation primarily as a combined
action of active regions and magnetic network. These components would be
superposed to an otherwise unchanging photosphere. the other view suggests that
the activity cycle modulation of S is primarily produced by a variation of L

which contains a nuclear maser source and is known to be heavily absorbed in
the X-rays. Analysis of the X-ray spectra observed by SAX in October 1996 and
1997 yields a spectral index 0.74+/-0.07, typical of Seyfert galaxies and
consistent with earlier observations of this source. The strong, soft X-ray
absorption has column density 1.79E(23)/cm^2, again consistent with earlier
results. The best fitting spectrum is that of a power law with a high energy
cutoff at 29+/-10 keV, a cold, marginally resolved Fe Kalpha line with EW 290
eV (1996) and a mildly ionized Fe K-edge at 7.37 keV. The Kalpha line and cold
absorption are consistent with origin in a accretion disk/torus through which
our line-of-sight passes at a radial distance of $\sim 50$ pc. The Fe K-edge is
mildly ionized suggesting the presence of ionized gas probably in the inner
accretion disk, close to the central source or in a separate warm absorber. The
data quality is too low to distinguish between these possibilities but the
edge-on geometry implied by the water maser emission favors the former.
Comparison with earlier observations of ESO103-G35 shows little/no change in
spectral parameters while the flux changes by factors of a few on timescales of
a few months. The 2--10 keV flux decreased by a factor of 2.7 between Oct 1996

constant or delayed response reflection component. The high energy cutoff is
lower than the typical 300keV values seen in Seyfert galaxies. A significant

that the optical-UV emission is not due to an optically-thick quiescent
accretion disk, nor due to synchrotron emission from an Advection-Dominated
Accretion Flow (ADAF). Emission from the bright spot could account for the
observed optical-UV component if the mass transfer rate in Cen X-4 is >~
2.10^16 g/s. Although the presence of an ADAF around the neutron star leads to
Compton upscattering of the soft X-ray photons radiated from the stellar
surface, we find that this process alone cannot account for the power law
component seen in the quiescent X-ray spectrum of Cen X-4 and other X-ray
transients containing neutron stars; this result is independent of whether the
source of soft photons is incandescent thermal emission or accretion-powered
emission. We conclude that, in models which invoke the presence of an ADAF and
a propeller effect for the quiescence of X-ray transients containing neutron
stars, the intrinsic emission from the ADAF must contribute very little to the
optical-UV and X-ray emission observed. If these ADAF+propeller models are
correct, the X-ray power law component observed must arise from regions where
the gas impacts the neutron star surface. Variability studies could greatly
help clarify the role of the various emission mechanisms involved.

quasars by dark halos in various cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies, in order
to determine the sensitivity of the prediction probabilities of images
separations to the input assumptions regarding halos and cosmologies. The mass
function of dark halos is assumed to be given by the Press-Schechter function.
The mass density profile of dark halos is alternatively taken to be the
singular isothermal sphere (SIS), the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, or the
generalized NFW profile. The cosmologies include: the Einstein-de Sitter model
(SCDM), the open model (OCDM), and the flat \Lambda-model (LCDM). As expected,
we find that the lensing probability is extremely sensitive to the mass density
profile of dark halos, and somewhat less so to the mean mass density in the
universe, and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations. NFW halos are very much
less effective in producing multiple images than SIS halos. However, none of
these models can completely explain the current observations: the SIS models
predict too many large splitting lenses, while the NFW models predict too few
small splitting lenses. This indicates that there must be at least two
populations of halos in the universe. A combination of SIS and NFW halos can
reasonably reproduce the current observations if we choose the mass for the
transition from SIS to NFW to be ~ 10^{13} solar masses. Additionally, there is
a tendency for CDM models to have too much power on small scales, i.e. too much
mass concentration; and it appears that the cures proposed for other apparent
difficulties of CDM would help here as well, an example being the warm dark
matter (WDM) variant which is shown to produce large splitting lenses fewer
than the corresponding CDM model by one order of magnitude.

a local map in the Fourier space for separating the E and B modes can be an
ill-defined problem, due to the non-periodic boundary condition in the map for
each mode. A strategy for the E-B separation in a local map can be through an
appropriate projection of the polarization tensor field into a unique vector
field, which naturally contains a curl-free E component and a divergence-free B
component. An integral method, equivalent to the real-space, top-hat filtering,
is proposed for extracting the smoothed ""charge"" and ""current"" of the E and B
modes separately. The top-hat filter function exhibits, in its power spectrum,
an oscillation of a well-defined frequency comparable to the filter size. It is
pointed out that when the inverse filter size is chosen properly, matching the
oscillation period in the E-mode power spectrum, the sensitivity for the E-mode
detection can be made to be significantly improved.

measurement of ArI, and the second of PII, ever performed in damped galaxies
and in high redshift objects. This DLA is well known for having one of the
lowest metal abundances and dust content, and the lowest fractional abundance
of molecular hydrogen H_2. The measured Ar abundance is [Ar/H] = - 1.91 (+/-
0.09) which is equal to the abundances of the other alpha-chain elements (O, S
and Si). The similarity of the Ar abundance with the other alpha-chain elements
implies the absence of significant photoionization by either UV background or
stellar sources along the sightline throughout the damped Ly_alpha system. Both
log(Ar/O) and log(Ar/S) ratios are found close to those measured in the
extragalactic HII regions and in blue compact galaxies where O is more abundant
by at least one order of magnitude. This strengthens the universality of the
Ar/O and Ar/S ratios and lends support to the existence of a universal IMF. The
abundance of the non-refractory element phosphorus [P/H] = - 2.31 (+/- 0.10)
confirms the low amount of chemical evolution in the DLA. This is the
measurement of P in the most metal-poor material and shows a subsolar [P/Fe] =

symmetric binary (AB) polymer blend confined into a thin film as a function of
the film thickness D. The monomer-wall interactions are short ranged and
antisymmetric, i.e, the left wall attracts the A-component of the mixture with
the same strength as the right wall the B-component, and give rise to a first
order wetting transition in a semi-infinite geometry. The phase diagram and the
crossover between different critical behaviors is explored. For large film
thicknesses we find a first order interface localisation/delocalisation
transition and the phase diagram comprises two critical points, which are the
finite film width analogies of the prewetting critical point. Using finite size
scaling techniques we locate these critical points and present evidence of 2D
Ising critical behavior. When we reduce the film width the two critical points
approach the symmetry axis $\phi=1/2$ of the phase diagram and for $D \approx 2
R_g$ we encounter a tricritical point. For even smaller film thickness the
interface localisation/delocalisation transition is second order and we find a
single critical point at $\phi=1/2$.
  Measuring the probability distribution of the interface position we determine
the effective interaction between the wall and the interface. This effective
interface potential depends on the lateral system size even away from the
critical points. Its system size dependence stems from the large but finite
correlation length of capillary waves. This finding gives direct evidence for a
renormalization of the interface potential by capillary waves in the framework
of a microscopic model.

kinematic acceleration of the observer, generated by a negative gradient of

the shear. Both additional terms are anisotropic for off-centre observers,
because of to their dependence on a telescopic angle of observation. This

reconstructed (via a 3-jet invariant mass) top quark. The single lepton channel
is swamped by background processes; however, with suitable cuts, a trilepton
signal emerges. While such a signal suffers from a low number of surviving

homoclinic structures. Then we investigate the question on the degeneracy v.s.
nondegeneracy of the hyperbolic foliations for Galerkin truncations of 2D Euler
equation. In particular, for a Galerkin truncation, we have computed the
explicit representation of the hyperbolic foliation which is of the degenerate
case, i.e., figure-eight case. We also study the robustness of this degeneracy
for a so-called dashed-line model through higher order Melnikov functions. The
first order and second order Melnikov functions are all identically zero, which
indicates that the degeneracy is relatively robust. The study in this paper
serves a clue in searching for homoclinic structures for 2D Euler equation. The
recent breakthrough result of mine on the existence of a Lax pair for 2D Euler

nonrigid field if and only if certain small 2-groups occur as Galois groups
over $F$. These results provide new ""automatic realizability"" results for
Galois groups over $F$. The groups we consider demonstrate the inequality of
two particular metabelian 2-extensions of $F$ which are unequal precisely when
$F$ is a nonrigid field. Using known results on connections between rigidity
and existence of certain valuations, we obtain Galois-theoretic criteria for
the existence of these valuations.

is investigated. A phenomenological approach, based on the exciton model, is
used for the description of pre-equilibrium emission. A model of deep inelastic
transfer is employed for the peripheral collisions in the post-pre-equilibrium
stage. An approach to describe more central collisions is proposed. A geometric
overlap formula is employed in a way suitable for given energy domain. A simple
geometric approach describing the interaction of participant and spectator
zones is used to determine the incomplete fusion channel. Excitation energies
of both fragments are determined. Results of the calculation are compared to
available experimental data and an overall satisfactorily agreement is
obtained. The model's ability to describe the production of the hot nuclei can
be employed in the study of multifragmentation and/or in the production of rare
beams.

functions of the isospin of disassembling sources and temperature at a moderate
freeze-out density for medium-size Xe isotopes in the framework of isospin
dependent lattice gas model. Multiplicities of emitted light particles,
isotopic and isobaric ratios of light particles show the strong dependence on
the isospin of the dissociation source, but double ratios of light isotope
pairs and the critical temperature determined by the extreme values of some
critical observables are insensitive to the isospin of the systems. Values of
the power law parameter of cluster mass distribution, mean multiplicity of
intermediate mass fragments ($IMF$), information entropy ($H$) and Campi's
second moment ($S_2$) also show a minor dependence on the isospin of Xe
isotopes at the critical point. In addition, the slopes of the average
multiplicites of the neutrons ($N_n$), protons ($N_p$), charged particles
($N_{CP}$), and IMFs ($N_{imf}$), slopes of the largest fragment mass number
($A_{max}$), and the excitation energy per nucleon of the disassembling source
($E^*/A$) to temperature are investigated as well as variances of the
distributions of $N_n$, $N_p$, $N_{CP}$, $N_{IMF}$, $A_{max}$ and $E^*/A$. It
is found that they can be taken as additional judgements to the critical
phenomena.

Grover's algorithm for a quantum computer. We introduce an effective two-level
model with dissipation and randomness (imperfections), which is based upon the
idea that ideal Grover's algorithm operates in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space.
The simulation results of this model and Grover's algorithm with imperfections
are compared, and it is found that they are in good agreement for appropriately
tuned parameters. It turns out that the main features of Grover's algorithm
with imperfections can be understood in terms of two basic mechanisms, namely,
a diffusion of probability density into the full Hilbert space and a stochastic
rotation within the original 2-dimensional Hilbert space.
