self-interacting. Heat conduction from the hot cluster halo leads to
evaporation of the relatively cooler galactic halos. The stellar distribution
would adiabatically expand as it readjusts to the loss of dark matter, reducing
the velocity dispersion and increasing the half-light radius. If the dark
matter content within that radius was f_dm = 25-50% of the total, as indicated
by current observations, the ellipticals in clusters would be offset from the
fundamental plane relation beyond the observational scatter. The requirement
that their halos survive for a Hubble time appears to exclude just that range
of the dark matter cross-section, 0.3 < sigma/m < 10^4 cm^2/g, thought to be
optimal for reducing central halo cusps, unless f_dm < 15%. If the
cross-section is allowed to vary with the relative velocity of dark matter
particles, sigma \propto v^{-2 delta}, a new problem of evaporation of dark
matter arises in the dwarf galaxies with low velocity dispersion. The halos of
large galaxies in clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Group can both
survive only if delta < 1.1 or delta > 1.8. In either case the problem of
central density cusps remains.

explained by the mere existence of structure with the appropriate scale in the
galaxy distribution in the Universe. We simulate a universe where the
distribution of galaxies has an intrinsic length scale and then investigate the
probability of observing in a given direction a spatial periodicity similar to
that observed in the pencil-beam surveys of the galactic polar regions. A
statistical analysis shows that this probability is of the order of 10^{-8}, a
value which excludes the afore mentioned explanation. This result contrasts
with the estimates based on Voronoi foam models which yield probabilities of
the order 10^{-1} - 10^{-2}. The conclusion that emerges from these studies put
together with the present one, is that although they can be obtained in some
models, the presence of an intrinsic scale in the structure is not sufficient
to achieve reasonable probabilities for observation of the detected
periodicities.

demonstrate that this result is essentially due to a relative $m_T$-scaling in

25 A$\cdot$GeV a suppression of $D$-mesons by a factor of $\sim$ 10 relative to

incorporating attractive $D$-meson self energies as suggested by QCD sum rules,
an approximate $m_T$-scaling is regained even at 25 A$\cdot$GeV. The effects of
$D$-meson rescattering and charmonium absorption are discussed, furthermore,

collisions of $Au + Au$ at 25, 160 A$\cdot$GeV and 21.3 A$\cdot$TeV.

  nuclei","25 pages, 11 postscript figures","Phys.Rev. C61 (2000) 064301","10.1103/PhysRevC.61.064301",,"nucl-th",,"  It is proposed that the odd-even staggering (OES) in the $\gamma$- bands of
heavy deformed nuclei can be reasonably characterized by a discrete
approximation of the fourth derivative of the odd-even energy difference as a
function of angular momentum $L$. This quantity exhibits a well developed
staggering pattern (zigzagging behavior with alternating signs) in rare earth
nuclei and actinides with long $\gamma$- bands ($L\geq 10$). It is shown that
the OES can be interpreted reasonably as the result of the interaction of the
$\gamma$ band with the ground band in the framework of a Vector Boson Model
with SU(3) dynamical symmetry. The model energy expression reproduces
successfully the staggering pattern in all considered nuclei up to $L=12-13$.
The general behavior of the OES effect in rotational regions is studied in
terms of the ground--$\gamma$ band-mixing interaction, showing that strong OES
effect occurs in regions with strong ground--$\gamma$ band-mixing interaction.
The approach used allows a detailed comparison of the OES in $\gamma$ bands
with the other kinds of staggering effects in nuclei and diatomic molecules.

chemical reactions has the following form: DU=DQ-PDV+SUM(muiDN) In the present
paper it has been proved by means of the theory of ordinary differential
equations that in the biggest part of the chemical reactions it must have the
following form: DU=DQ+PDV+SUM(muiDN) The result obtained allows to explain a
paradox in chemical thermodynamics: the heat of chemical processes measured by
calorimetry and by the Vant-Hoff equation differs very much from each other.
The result is confirmed by many experiments.

presented by Biham et al. [PRA 60, 2742 (1999)] is generalized. It is applied
to the large class of Grover's type algorithms in which the Hadamard transform
is replaced by any other unitary transformation and the phase inversion is
replaced by a rotation by an arbitrary angle. The time evolution of the
amplitudes of the marked and unmarked states, for any initial complex amplitude
distribution is expressed using first order linear difference equations. These
equations are solved exactly. The solution provides the number of iterations T
after which the probability of finding a marked state upon measurement is the
highest, as well as the value of this probability, P_max. Both T and P_max are
found to depend on the averages and variances of the initial amplitude
distributions of the marked and unmarked states, but not on higher moments.
