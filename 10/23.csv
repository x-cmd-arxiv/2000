assumed that the GRB is produced by discrete sources. Two basic classes of
objects as dominant contributors to the GRB are considered: a) blazars and b)
starburst galaxies. Predicted logN-logS counts are calculated for these two
models. To produce substantial fraction of the XRB, both classes of sources are
subject to strong evolution. Since blazars are several orders of magnitude more
luminous than starburst galaxies, their number required to produce the GRB is
much smaller than the number of starburst galaxies. In effect, fluctuations of
the GRB in the blazar model are relatively high. It is shown that moderate
improvement in the measurements of the GRB flux will allow us to discriminate

in extra dimensions by Arkani-Hamed, Cheng, Dobrescu, and Hall, based on the
(improved) ladder Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation for the D-(=6,8-)-dimensional
gauge theories. We find that the bulk QCD cannot have larger coupling beyond
the non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, the existence of which is
supported by a recent lattice analysis. The coupling strength at the fixed
point is evaluated by using the one-loop renormalization group equation. It is
then found that, in a version with only the third family (as well as the gauge
bosons) living in the D-dimensional bulk, the critical (dimensionless) coupling
for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking to occur is larger than the UV fixed
point of the bulk QCD coupling for D=6, while smaller for D=8. We further find
that the improved ladder SD equation in D dimensions has an approximate
scale-invariance due to the running of the coupling and hence has an
essential-singularity scaling of the ``conformal phase transition,'' similar to
Miransky scaling in the four-dimensional ladder SD equation with a nonrunning
coupling. This essential-singularity scaling can resolve the fine-tuning even
when the cutoff (``string scale'') is large. Such a theory has a large
anomalous dimension \gamma_m=D/2 - 1 and is expected to be free from the
flavor-changing-neutral-current problem as in walking technicolor for D=4.
Furthermore, the induced bulk Yukawa coupling becomes finite even at infinite
cutoff limit (in the formal sense), similarly to the renormalizability of the
gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Comments are made on the use of the
``effective'' coupling, which includes finite renormalization effects, instead
of the \bar{MS} running coupling in the improved ladder SD equation.

under certain circumstances, obtain lower or upper bounds (or both) to the sum
of the full perturbation series by using the Borel transform and a variational
conformal map. The method is illustrated by applying it to various mathematical
toy-models for which exact results are known. One of these models is used to
exemplify how non-perturbative contributions supplement the sum of a
Borel-nonsummable series to give the final exact and unambiguous result.
Finally, the method is applied to some physical problems. In particular, some
speculations are made on the phase of quantum electrodynamics at super-high
temperatures from a study of its perturbative free-energy density.

  The invariant $\rho$ has interesting geometric properties: It is often
straightforward to calculate; e. g. for $K$ a torus knot and $\gamma$ an
annulus-spanning arc, $\rho(K, \gamma) = 1$. Although $\rho$ is defined
abstractly, it is naturally revealed when $K \cup \gamma$ is put in thin
position. If $\rho \neq 1$ then there is a minimal genus Seifert surface $F$
for $K$ such that the tunnel $\gamma$ can be slid and isotoped to lie on $F$.
One consequence: if $\rho(K, \gamma) \neq 1$ then $genus(K) > 1$. This confirms
a conjecture of Goda and Teragaito for pairs $(K, \gamma)$ with $\rho(K,
\gamma) \neq 1$.
