achieved if we assume that the initial binary fraction is ~ 50% and that the
lowest mass white dwarfs (M < 0.3 Msun) cool faster than the most recently

of close double white dwarfs of 0.05 yr^{-1}, a birth rate of AM CVn systems of
0.005 yr^{-1}, a merger rate of pairs with a combined mass exceeding the

Israelian et al. and Boesgaard et al. can be well represented both
qualitatively and quantitatively by this model. Under the assumption of an
initial Fe ([Fe/H] = -3) and O inventory due to the prompt production by the
first very massive stars, the data at -3 < [Fe/H] < -1 are interpreted to
result from the addition of O and Fe only from type II supernovae (SNII) to the
prompt inventory. At [Fe/H] = -1, SNII still contribute O while both SNII and
type Ia supernovae contribute Fe. During this later stage, (O/Fe) sharply drops
off to an asymptotic value of 0.8(O/Fe)_sun. The value of (O/Fe) for the prompt
inventory at [Fe/H] = -3 is found to be (O/Fe) = 20(O/Fe)_sun. This result
suggests that protogalaxies with low ``metallicities'' should exhibit high
values of (O/Fe). The C/O ratio produced by the first very massive stars is
expected to be much less than 1 so that all the C should be tied up as CO and
that C dust and hydrocarbon compounds should be quite rare at epochs
corresponding to [Fe/H] < -3.

explored using 1D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations coupled with the
nonequilibrium processes of H2 formation. The simulations show that depending
upon the initial density,there are two occasions for the fragmentation of
primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively low initial density, the
radial contraction is slow due to less effective H2 cooling. This filament
tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches
$10^{8-9}$ cm$^{-3}$, where H2 cooling by three-body reactions is effective and
the fragment mass is more massive than some tens $M_\odot$. In contrast, if a
filament is initially dense, the more effective H2 cooling with the help of
three-body reactions allows the filament to contract up to $n\sim 10^{12}$
cm$^{-3}$. After the density reaches $n\sim 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the filament
becomes optically thick to H2 lines and the radial contraction subsequently
almost stops. At this final hydrostatic stage, the fragment mass is lowered
down to $\approx 1M_\odot$ because of the high density of the filament. The
dependence of the fragment mass upon the initial density could be translated
into the dependence on the local amplitude of random Gaussian density fields or
the epoch of the collapse of a parent cloud. Hence, it is predicted that the
initial mass function of Population III stars is likely to be bimodal with
peaks of $\approx 10^2 M_\odot$ and $\approx 1M_\odot$, where the relative
heights could be a function of the collapse epoch.

source X1916-053 conducted with RXTE between February and October of 1996. Our
goal was to finally measure the binary period - as either the x-ray dip period
or ~1% longer optical modulation period, thereby establishing if the binary has
a precessing disk (SU UMa model) or a third star (triple model). Combined with
historical data (1979-96), the x-ray dip period is measured to be 3000.6508
$\pm$ 0.0009 sec with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit $|\dot P| \leq 2.06 \times
10^{-11}$. From our quasi-simultaneous optical observations (May 14-23, 1996)
and historical data (1987-96), we measure the optical modulation period to be
3027.5510 $\pm$ 0.0052 sec with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit $|\dot P| \leq 2.28
\times 10^{-10}$. The two periods are therefore each stable (over all recorded
data) and require a $3.9087 \pm 0.0008$d beat period. This beat period, and
several of its harmonics is also observed as variations in the dip shape. Phase
modulation of x-ray dips, observed in a 10 consecutive day observation, is
highly correlated with the $\sim$3.9d dip shape modulation. The 1987-1996
optical observations show that the optical phase fluctuations are a factor of 3
larger than those in the x-ray. We discuss SU UMa vs. triple models to describe
the X1916-053 light curve behavior and conclude that the x-ray dip period, with
smaller phase jitter, is probably the binary period so that the required
precession is most likely similar to that observed in SU UMa and x-ray nova
systems. However the ``precession'' period stability and especially the fact
that the times of x-ray bursts may partially cluster to occur just after x-ray
dips, continue to suggest that this system may be a hierarchical triple.

analysis, we have investigated four different spectral classification
algorithms: spectral line strengths, a principal component decomposition, a
wavelet analysis and the fitting of spectral synthesis models to the data. We
find that a significant fraction (25%) of our observed Coma galaxies show signs
of recent star-formation activity and that the velocity dispersion of these
active galaxies (emission-line and post-starburst galaxies) is 30% larger than
the absorption-line galaxies. We also find no active galaxies within the

Coma active galaxies is consistent with that found at higher redshift for the

hydrostatic equilibrium. Moderately strong shocks are probably common in
clusters, through the actions of several agents. The most obvious of these
agents include winds from galaxies undergoing intense episodes of starbursts,
active galaxies and cosmic inflows, such as accretion and cluster mergers. We
describe our own work derived from simulations of large scale structure
formation, in which we have, for the first time, explicitly included passive
components of high energy particles. We find, indeed that shocks associated

observations of the R=15.9 narrow emission line galaxy R117_A which lies on the
edge of the error circle of the ROSAT X-ray source R117 (from McHardy et al
1998). The overall spectral energy distribution of the galaxy is well modelled
by a combination of a normal spiral galaxy and a moderate-strength burst of
star formation. The far infra-red and radio emission is extended along the
major axis of the galaxy, indicating an extended starburst.
  On positional grounds, the galaxy is a good candidate for the identification
of R117 and the observed X-ray flux is very close to what would be expected
from a starburst of the observed far infra-red and radio fluxes. Although an
obscured high redshift QSO cannot be entirely ruled out as contributing some
fraction of the X-ray flux, we find no candidates to K=20.8 within the X-ray
errorbox and so conclude that R117_A is responsible for a large fraction, if
not all, of the X-ray emission from R117.
  Searches for indicators of an obscured AGN in R117_A have so far proven
negative; deep spectropolarimetric observations show no signs of broad lines to
a limit of one per cent and, for the observed far infra-red and radio emission,
we would expect a ten times greater X-ray flux if the overall emission were
powered by an AGN. We therefore conclude that the X-ray emission from R117 is
dominated by starburst emission from the galaxy R117_A.

persistent, narrow, branching channels rather than smoothly spreading fans.
Theoretical study of this flow, including electron scattering by impurities and

of 139La T1 values at low temperature reveals a wide spread of spin fluctuation
frequencies in CuO2 planes. A simple estimate shows that Cu nuclei at sites
where electronic fluctuations are the slowest are not observable because of too
short relaxation times (wipeout effect). This means that the Cu NQR wipeout,
observed in this sample, can be explained primarily by slow magnetic, rather
than charge, fluctuations. This result does not rule out the connection between
wipeout effect and charge stripe order [Hunt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4300

also show that, while the canonical equilibrium can be reached with no apparent

conductivity. Both single crystals and polycrystalline material were examined.
The MIT is accompanied by no change in crystal symmetry and a change in unit
cell volume of less than 0.05%. The resistivity shows little temperature
dependence above 226 K, but increases by 3 orders of magnitude as the sample is
cooled to 4 K. The specific heat anomaly resembles a mean-field transition and
shows no hysteresis or latent heat. Cd2Os2O7 orders magnetically at the MIT.
The magnetization data is consistent with antiferromagnetic order, with a small
parasitic ferromagnetic component. The Hall and Seebeck coefficients are
consistent with a semiconducting gap opening at the Fermi energy at the MIT. We

direction. We develop a perturbative technique that gives the diabolical points
as the roots of a small number of polynomials in the transverse component of
the magnetic field and the fourth order basal plane anisotropy. In terms of
these roots we obtain approximate analytic formulas that apply to any system
with total spin S \le 10. The analytic results are found to compare reasonably
well with exact numerical diagonalization for the case of Mn12. In addition,
the perturbation theory shows that the diabolical points may be indexed by the
magnetic quantum numbers of the levels involved, even at large transverse
fields. Certain points of degeneracy are found to be mergers (or near mergers)
of two or three diabolical points beacuse of the symmetry of the problem.

formula C_l = const/[l(l +1)] aimed at describing the lower order multipoles of
the CMBR temperature variations caused by density perturbations with the flat
spectrum. Clearly, this formula requires amendments, as it predicts an
infinitely large monopole C_0, and a dipole moment C_1 only 6/2 times larger
than the quadrupole C_2, both predictions in conflict with observations. We
restore the terms omitted in the course of the derivation of this formula, and
arrive at a new expression. According to the corrected formula, the monopole
moment is finite and small, while the dipole moment is sensitive to
short-wavelength perturbations, and numerically much larger than the
quadrupole, as one would expect on physical grounds. At the same time, the
function l(l +1)C_l deviates from a horizontal line and grows with l, for l
\geq 2. We show that the inclusion of the modulating (transfer) function
terminates the growth and forms the first peak, recently observed. We fit the
theoretical curves to the position and height of the first peak, as well as to
the observed dipole, varying three parameters: red-shift at decoupling,
red-shift at matter-radiation equality, and slope of the primordial spectrum.
It appears that there is always a deficit, as compared with the COBE
observations, at small multipoles, l \sim 10. We demonstrate that a reasonable
and theoretically expected amount of gravitational waves bridges this gap at
small multipoles, leaving the other fits as good as before. We show that the
observationally acceptable models permit somewhat `blue' primordial spectra.
This allows one to avoid the infra-red divergence of cosmological
perturbations, which is otherwise present.

and the Zimanyi and Moszkowski models (ZM and ZM3). For other choices of the
parameters, the new models give very interesting and new physical results.We

star sequence, red-shift, hyperon populations, radial distribution of
particles, among other relevant static properties of these stellar objects. The
phenomenology of neutron stars in ZM models is presented and compared to the
phenomenology obtained in other versions of the Walecka model. We have found
that the ZM3 model is too soft and predicts a very small maximum neutron star
mass, $\sim0.72 M_\odot$. A strong similarity between the results of ZM-like
models and those with exponential couplings is noted. Sensibility of the
results to the specific choice of the values for the binding energy and
saturation density is pointed out. Finally, we discuss the very intense scalar
condensates found in the interior of neutron stars which may lead to negative
