also be strongly evolved and probably evolving along the AGB. Neither our

orbital variability which may indicate that the period is too large for direct
binary interaction. Most interestingly, a strong lithium resonance line is
detected, which yields an abundance of log(Li)=3.6. Several explanations for
this large lithium content are explored.

equilibrium than nonrotating or uniformly rotating stars, according to general
relativity. The remnant of a binary neutron star merger may give rise to such a
``hypermassive'' object. While such a star may be dynamically stable against
gravitational collapse and bar formation, the radial stabilization due to
differential rotation is likely to be temporary. Magnetic braking and viscosity
combine to drive the star to uniform rotation, even if the seed magnetic field
and the viscosity are small. This process inevitably leads to delayed collapse,
which will be accompanied by a delayed gravitational wave burst and, possibly,
a gamma-ray burst. We provide a simple, Newtonian, MHD calculation of the
braking of differential rotation by magnetic fields and viscosity. The star is
idealized as a differentially rotating, infinite cylinder consisting of a
homogeneous, incompressible conducting gas. We solve analytically the simplest
case in which the gas has no viscosity and the star resides in an exterior
vacuum. We treat numerically cases in which the gas has internal viscosity and
the star is embedded in an exterior, low-density, conducting medium. Our
evolution calculations are presented to stimulate more realistic MHD
simulations in full 3+1 general relativity. They serve to identify some of the
key physical and numerical parameters, scaling behavior and competing
timescales that characterize this important process.

from nonradiative shocks in three supernova remnants: the Cygnus Loop, RCW 86

hydrogen Balmer lines which have both a broad component caused by
proton-neutral charge exchange and a narrow component caused by excitation of
cold neutrals entering the shock. In each remnant we have obtained the broad to
narrow flux ratios of the Halpha and Hbeta lines and measured the Halpha broad
component width.
  A new numerical shock code computes the broad and narrow Balmer line emission
from nonradiative shocks in partially neutral gas. The Balmer line fluxes are
sensitive to Lyman line trapping and the degree of electron-proton temperature
equilibration. The code calculates the density, temperature and size of the
postshock ionization layer and uses a Monte Carlo simulation to compute narrow
Balmer line enhancement from Lyman line trapping. The initial fraction of the
shock energy allocated to the electrons and protons (the equilibration) is a
free parameter. Our models show that variations in electron-proton temperature
equilibration and Lyman line trapping can reproduce the observed range of broad
to narrow ratios. The results give 80%-100% equilibration in nonradiative
portions of the NE Cygnus Loop (v_shock ~ 300 km/s), 40%-50% equilibration in
nonradiative portions of RCW 86 (v_shock ~ 600 km/s) and <~ 20% equilibration

clouds in early universe. Here we re-examine the Fall & Rees (1985) model for
formation of proto-globular cluster clouds (PGCCs) via thermal instabilities in
a protogalactic halo. We first argue, based on the previous study by others,
that under the protogalactic environments only nonlinear density
inhomogeneities can condense into PGCCs. We then carry out numerical
simulations of the collapse of overdense clouds in one-dimensional spherical
geometry, including self-gravity and radiative cooling down to T=10^4 K. Since
imprinting of Jeans mass at 10^4 K is essential to this model, here we focus on
the cases where external UV background radiation prevents the formation of H2
molecules and so prevent the cloud from cooling below 10^4 K. The quantitative
results from these simulations can be summarized as follows: 1) Perturbations
smaller than M_min ~ (10^{5.6} M_sun) (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-2} cool isobarically,
while perturbations larger than M_max ~ (10^8 M_sun) (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-2} cool
isochorically. On the other hand, intermediate size perturbations (M_min<
M_pgcc < M_max) are compressed supersonically. 2) For supersonically collapsing
clouds, the density compression factor after they cool to T_c=10^4 K range
10^{2.5}-10^6. 3) For supersonically collapsing clouds the Jeans mass can be
reduced to as small as 10^{5.5} M_sun (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-1/2} at the maximum
compression. 4) The density profile of simulated PGCCs can be approximated by a
constant core with a halo of rho ~ r^{-2} rather than a singular isothermal

Therefore, the X-rays are reconfirmed to arise via inverse-Compton scattering
of the cosmic microwave photons, as Kaneda et al. (1995) and Feigelson et al.
(1995) concluded. The surface brightness of the inverse-Compton X-rays exhibits
a relatively flat distribution over the west lobe, indicative of an
approximately spherical emissivity distribution with a radius of ~11' (75 kpc).
n contrast, the 1.4 GHz radio image by Ekers et al. (1983) exhibits a rim-
brightened surface brightness, consistentwith a shell-like emissivity
distribution whose inner and outer boundaries are 4' and 11', respectively.
These morphological differences between radio and X-rays suggest that the
relativistic electrons are distributed homogeneously over the lobe volume,
whereas the magnetic field is amplified toward the lobe rim region.

jets, in the framework of the ballooning ordering expansion. Quite
unexpectedly, they involve a term which is linear in the magnetic shear. This
implies that cylindrical configurations can be destabilized by a negative
magnetic shear as well as by a favorable equilibrium pressure gradient, in
distinction with the predictions of Suydam's stability criterion, which
suggests on the contrary that the shear is always stabilizing.
  We have used these criteria to establish sufficient conditions for
instability. In particular, the magnetic shear can always destabilize jets with
vanishing current density on the axis, a feature which is generically found in
jets which are launched from an accretion disk. We also show that standard
nonrotating jet models (where the toroidal field dominates the poloidal one),
which are known to be unstable, are not stabilized by rotation, unless the
plasma $\beta$ parameter and the strength of the rotation forces are both close
to the limit allowed by the condition of radial equilibrium.
  The new magnetic shear-driven instability found in this paper, as well as the
more conventional pressure-driven instability, might provide us with a
potential energy source for the particle acceleration mechanisms underlying the
high energy emission which takes place in the interior of AGN jets.

morphology, consistent with them hosting star formation. However, ~65% of the
cluster members classified morphologically as spirals (with HST), have no
detectable H-alpha emission; star-formation and morphological evolution in

imaging and spectra of many clusters of galaxies. However high resolution X-ray
spectra of several clusters from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on
XMM-Newton now show a soft X-ray spectrum inconsistent with a simple cooling
flow. The main problem is a lack of the emission lines expected from gas
cooling below 1--2 keV. Lines from gas at about 2--3 keV are observed, even in
a high temperature cluster such as A 1835, indicating that gas is cooling down
to about 2--3 keV, but is not found at lower temperatures. Here we discuss
several solutions to the problem; heating, mixing, differential absorption and
inhomogeneous metallicity. Continuous or sporadic heating creates further
problems, including the targetting of the heat at the cooler gas and also the
high total energy required. So far there is no clear observational evidence for
widespread heating, or shocks, in cluster cores, except in radio lobes which
occupy only part of the volume. The implied ages of cooling flows are short, at
about 1 Gyr. Mixing. or absorption, of the cooling gas are other possibilities.
Alternatively, if the metals in the intracluster medium are not uniformly
spread but are clumped, then little line emission is expected from the gas
cooling below 1 keV. The low metallicity part cools without line emission
whereas the strengths of the soft X-ray lines from the metal-rich gas depend on
the mass fraction of that gas and not on the abundance, since soft X-ray line
emission dominates the cooling function below 2 keV.

that the X-ray spectrum is featureless, and well described by a power law,
extending to three the class of shell-type SNRs dominated by nonthermal X-ray
emission. Like G347.3-0.5, this low-latitude remnant displays discrete regions
of enhanced emission along the rim as well as faint nonthermal emission from
the interior. We derive limits on the thermal content of the remnant emission,
although the presence of the Vela SNR compromises our ability to seriously
constrain a low temperature component. Limits placed on the amount of Sc-K
emission are compared with the expected flux based upon the reported 44Ti
emission from G2662.-1.2. We also report on an unresolved X-ray source
surrounded by diffuse emission near the center of the remnant. The properties
of the source are not well determined, but appear consistent with the
interpretation that the source is a neutron star surrounded by a synchrotron
nebula. Alternatively, the source may be associated with one of two stars
located within the positional error circle, but this appears somewhat unlikely.

the viscous decretion disk scenario. In this scenario, the matter ejected from
the equatorial surface of the star drifts outward because of the effect of
viscosity, and forms the disk. For simplicity, we adopt the alpha-prescription
for the viscous stress, and assume the disk to be isothermal. Solving the
resulting wind equations, we find that a transonic solution exists for any
value of alpha. The sonic point is located at r>100R for plausible values of
parameters, where R is the stellar radius. The sonic radius is smaller for
higher temperature and/or larger radiative force. We also find that the
topology of the sonic point is nodal for alpha>0.95, while it is of saddle type
for alpha<0.9. We expect that the sonic point in the former case is unstable,
whereas that in the latter case is stable. The outflow is highly subsonic in
the inner part of the disk. Roughly, the outflow velocity increases linearly
with r and the surface density decreases as r^{-2}. Interestingly, the disk is
near Keplerian in the inner subsonic region, while it is angular momentum
conserving in the outer subsonic region and in the supersonic region. Our
results, together with the observed range of the base density for Be star
disks, suggest that the mass loss rate in the equatorial region is at most

insulators: J_c/t = 1.45(5). The quasiparticle gap scales as |J|. S(q,\omega),
evolves smoothly from its strong coupling form with spin gap at q = (\pi,\pi)
to a spin wave form. At J>0, A(\vec{k},\omega) shows a dispersion relation
following that of hybridized bands. For J < J_c this feature is supplemented by
shadows thus pointing to a coexistence of Kondo screening and magnetism. For J
< 0 A(\vec{k},\omega) is similar to that of non-interacting electrons in a
staggered magnetic field. Spin, T_S, and charge, T_C, scales are defined. For
weak to intermediate couplings, T_S marks the onset of antiferromagnetic
fluctuations and follows a J^2 law. At strong couplings T_S scales as J. T_C
scales as J both at weak and strong couplings. At and slightly below T_C we
observe i) a rise in the resistivity as a function of decreasing temperature,
ii) a dip in the integrated density of states at the Fermi energy and iii) the
occurrence of hybridized bands in A(k,\omega). It is shown that in the weak

Color triplet technipions, which play the role of scalar leptoquarks, are
investigated due to their potential production in decays of strongly coupled
color octet technirhos. Events with a signature of two heavy flavor jets and
missing energy may indicate the decay of a second (third) generation leptoquark
to a charm (bottom) quark and a neutrino. As the data is found to be consistent

d (each of them has three colored members). From Dirac's sea concept and the
quark confinement idea, we conjecture and then assume that the quarks (in the
vacuum state) compose colorless particles (uud and udd, hereafter will be
called the Lee Particles). Moreover, the Lee Particles lead in a natural way to
the construction - a body center cubic lattice in the vacuum. Consequently,
there exists a strong interaction periodic field with body center cubic
periodic symmetries and an electromagnetic interaction periodic field (from the
charged Lee Particles uud) with simple cubic periodic symmetries in the vacuum.
In terms of the energy band theory, using a point baryon approximation (i.e.,
omitting the structure of the Lee Particles), and from the symmetries of the
strong interaction periodic field, we have deduced the intrinsic quantum
numbers (I, S, C, b, Q) of all baryons and a unified mass formula from which
all baryon masses can be found. This theoretical baryon spectrum is in
accordance with the experimental results in both intrinsic quantum numbers and
masses. These results show that various baryons are the energy band excited
states of the Lee Particles. We also predict some new baryons: \Lambda

of the electromagnetic field is much smaller than a typical length scale of the
graviton two-point function, the speed of light depends on the direction of
propagation and on the polarisation of the radiation. In the opposite case, the
speed of light may also depend on the energy of the electromagnetic radiation.
We study in detail wave propagation in two special backgrounds, flat
Robertson-Walker and static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the case of a
flat Robertson-Walker gravitational background we find that the corrected
electromagnetic field equations correspond to an isotropic medium with a
time-dependent effective refractive index. For a static, spherically symmetric

the direction of the static field (relative to the crystallographic axis of the
lattice) is briefly discussed.

hydrogen, helium, hydride ion, and positronium hydride PsH have been computed
using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method and explicitly correlated wave
functions. Results for the static dipole polarizability by means of the
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method and the finite field approach show the VMC
results to be quite accurate. From these dynamic polarizabilities van der Waals
dispersion coefficients for the interaction of PsH with ordinary electronic
systems can be computed, allowing one to predict the dispersion energy for the
interaction between PsH and less exotic atoms and molecules.

e$^+$LiF ground states were computed by means of diffusion Monte Carlo
simulations. These results allow us to predict the equilibrium geometries and
the vibrational frequencies for these exotic systems,and to discuss their
stability with respect to the various dissociation channels. Since the
adiabatic positron affinities were found to be smaller than the dissociation
energies for both complexes, we propose these two molecules as possible
candidates in the challenge to produce and detect stable positron-molecule
systems.

probability density function with continuous second order partial derivatives.
Consider the problem of estimating the true value of f(z) > 0 at a single point
z, from n independent observations. It is shown that, the fastest possible
estimators (like the k-nearest neighbor and kernel) have minimum asymptotic
mean square errors when the space of observations is thought as conformally
curved. The optimal metric is shown to be generated by the Hessian of f in the
regions where the Hessian is definite. Thus, the peaks and valleys of f are
surrounded by singular horizons when the Hessian changes signature from
Riemannian to pseudo-Riemannian. Adaptive estimators based on the optimal
variable metric show considerable theoretical and practical improvements over
traditional methods. The formulas simplify dramatically when the dimension of
the data space is 4. The similarities with General Relativity are striking but
possibly illusory at this point. However, these results suggest that
nonparametric density estimation may have something new to say about current
physical theory.
