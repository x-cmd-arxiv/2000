expected to be extremely rare since they must consist of equally luminous and
thus almost equally evolved objects, which requires an extremely similar
initial mass. In this contribution we discuss such rare double evolved SB2
system: HD172481. This binary includes an F-type post-AGB object and an M-type
AGB companion. The spectrum shows a surprisingly strong LiI 670.8nm line with
an equivalent width of 54mA yielding a lithium abundance of log(Li)=3.6.
Several explanations for this huge lithium content are explored.

The spatial distribution of the stellar clusters is not coincident with that of
the bright HII regions, as revealed by the HST/NICMOS Pa_alpha image. Overall,
the circumnuclear star formation in NGC2903 shows a ring-like morphology with
an approximate diameter of 625pc.
  The SF properties of the stellar clusters and HII regions have been studied
using the photometric and spectroscopic information in conjunction with
evolutionary synthesis models. The population of bright stellar clusters shows
a very narrow range of ages, 4-7 X 10^6 yr after the peak of star formation, or
absolute ages 6.5-9.5 X 10^6yr (for the assumed short-duration Gaussian
bursts), and luminosities similar to the clusters found in the Antennae
interacting galaxy. This population of young stellar clusters accounts for some
7-12% of the total stellar mass in the central 625pc of NGC2903. The HII
regions in the ring of star formation have luminosities close to that of the
super-giant HII region 30 Doradus, they are younger than the stellar clusters,
and will probably evolve into bright infrared stellar clusters similar to those
observed today. We find that the star formation efficiency in the central
regions of NGC2903 is higher than in normal galaxies, approaching the lower end
of infrared luminous galaxies.

partial eclipses of the emission region by the accretion column occurring once
each rotation period. We present pulse-phase spectroscopy from Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer satellite observations of GX 1+4 and RX J0812.4-3114 which for
the first time confirms this interpretation. The dip phase corresponds to the
closest approach of the column axis to the line of sight, and the additional
optical depth for photons escaping from the column in this direction gives rise
to both the decrease in flux and increase in the fitted optical depth measured
at this phase. Analysis of the arrival time of individual dips in GX~1+4
provides the first measurement of azimuthal wandering of a neutron star
accretion column. The column longitude varies stochastically with standard
deviation 2-6 degrees depending on the source luminosity. Measurements of the
phase width of the dip both from mean pulse profiles and individual eclipses
demonstrates that the dip width is proportional to the flux. The variation is
consistent with that expected if the azimuthal extent of the accretion column
depends only upon the Keplerian velocity at the inner disc radius, which varies
as a consequence of the accretion rate Mdot.

the free-streaming scale, R_f, and the velocity dispersion, v_w, are determined
by the mass m_w of the WDM particle. We find that v_w is too small to affect
the density profiles of WDM halos. Down to the resolution attained in our
simulations, there is not any significant difference in the density profiles
and concentrations of halos obtained in simulations with and without the
inclusion of v_w. The density profiles of halos with masses down to ~0.01 the
filtering mass M_f can be described by the NFW shape; significant soft cores
are not formed. Nevertheless, the concentrations of these halos are lower than
those of the CDM counterparts and are approximately independent of mass. The
lower concentrations of WDM halos with respect to their CDM counterparts can be
accounted for their late formation epoch. Overall, our results point to a
series of advantages of a WDM model over the CDM one. In addition to solving
the substructure problem, a WDM model with R_f~0.16 Mpc (m_w~0.75 kev; flat
cosmology with Omega_L=h=0.7) also predicts concentrations, a Tully-Fisher
relation, and formation epochs for small halos which seems to be in better

photometry and spectroscopy and space-based UV/optical spectrophotometry. The
analysis combines the ``classical'' EB study of light and radial velocity
curves, which yields the stellar masses and radii, with a new analysis of the
observed energy distribution, which yields the effective temperature,
metallicity, and reddening of the system plus the distance ``attenuation
factor'', essentially (radius/distance)^2. Combining the results gives the
distance to HV982, which is 50.2 +/- 1.2 kpc. This distance determination
consists of a detailed study of well-understood objects (B stars) in a
well-understood evolutionary phase (core H burning), and is free of the biases
and uncertainties that plague various other techniques. After correcting for
the location of HV982, we find an implied distance to the optical center of the

from our earlier result for the EB HV2274, which implies a bar distance of 45.9

unique LMC distance or, alternatively, suggest a significant depth to the
stellar distribution in the LMC. Some evidence for this latter hypothesis is
discussed.

to VLA fluxes. Extended emission was detected towards all the sources. The
extended emission consists of one to several compact components and a diffuse
extended envelope. All the UC HII regions but two are located in the compact
components, where the UC HII regions always correspond to their peaks. The
compact components with UC HII regions are usually smaller and denser than
those without UC HII regions. Our recombination line observations indicate that
the ultracompact, compact, and extended components are physically associated.
The UC HII regions and their associated compact components are likely to be
ionized by the same sources on the basis of the morphological relations

that the rotation changes from differential in latitude in the convection zone
to almost uniform in the radiative region below. The transition occurs in a
thin layer, the tachocline, which is the seat of strong shear in the vertical
direction. In this Note we examine whether this rotation profile can lead to
shear turbulence at the top of the radiation zone. By using the standard solar
model, we show that such turbulence can be generated only in a narrow region
0.695R_sun < r < 0.713R_sun at the equator and even in narrower layers at
higher latitudes. We conclude that the turbulence generated by this vertical
shear is unlikely to play a significant role in the transport of matter and
angular momentum, and that other mechanisms must be invoked to achieve this.

the lack of small galaxies in the field is due to the inhibition of star
formation in the galaxies as opposed to the fact that their small dark matter
halos do not exist. In this work we outline the likely properties of low-mass
dark galaxies, and describe observational strategies for finding them, and
where in the sky to search. The results are presented as a function of the
global properties of dark matter, in particular the presence or absence of a
substantial baryonic dark matter component. If the dark matter is purely cold
and has a Navarro, Frenk and White density profile, directly detecting dark
galaxies will only be feasible with present technology if the galaxy has a
maximum velocity dispersion in excess of 70 km/s, in which case the dark
galaxies could strongly lens background objects. This is much higher than the
maximum velocity dispersions in most dwarf galaxies. If the dark matter in
galaxy halos has a baryonic component close to the cosmic ratio, the
possibility of directly detecting dark galaxies is much more realistic; the
optimal method of detection will depend on the nature of the dark matter. A
number of more indirect methods are also discussed.

for spin-mediated $d-$wave superconductivity, the fermionic spectral function,
the density of states, the tunneling conductance through an insulating
junction, and the optical conductivity are affected by the interaction with
collective spin excitations, which below $T_c$ are propagating, magnon-like
quasiparticles with gap $\Delta_s$.
  We show that the interaction with a propagating spin excitation gives rise to
singularities at frequencies $\Delta + \Delta_s$ for the spectral function and
the density of states, and at
  $2\Delta + \Delta_s$ for tunneling and optical conductivities, where $\Delta$
is the maximum value of the $d-$wave gap. We further argue that recent optical
measurements also allow one to detect subleading singularities at $4\Delta$ and
$2\Delta + 2\Delta_s$. We consider the experimental detection of these
singularities as a strong evidence in favor of the magnetic scenario for
superconductivity in cuprates.

we review why the proximity effect sharply discriminates between systems with

incorporated into theories of SN systems. Turning to less well investigated
terrain, we discuss the impact of quantum diffractive scattering on the
structure of the density of states in the normal region. We consider ballistic
systems weakly disordered by pointlike impurities as a test case and
demonstrate that diffractive processes akin to normal metal weak localization
lead to the formation of a hard spectral gap -- a hallmark of SN systems with
chaotic dynamics. Turning to the more difficult case of clean systems with
chaotic boundary scattering, we argue that semiclassical approaches, based on
classifications in terms of classical trajectories, cannot explain the gap
phenomenon. Employing an alternative formalism based on elements of
quasiclassics and the ballistic $\sigma$-model, we demonstrate that the inverse
of the so-called Ehrenfest time is the relevant energy scale in this context.
We discuss some fundamental difficulties related to the formulation of low
energy theories of mesoscopic chaotic systems in general and how they prevent
us from analysing the gap structure in a rigorous manner. Given these
difficulties, we argue that the proximity effect represents a basic and
challenging test phenomenon for theories of quantum chaotic systems.

of scaling theory using both temperature T=100-700 mK and frequency f <= 6 GHz
in a two parameter scaling ansatz. For the plateau transition width we find
scaling behaviour for both its temperature dependence as well as its frequency
dependence. However, the corresponding scaling exponent for temperature
kappa=0.42 significantly differs from the one deduced for frequency scaling
(c=0.6). Additionally we use the high frequency experiments to suppress the
contact resistances that strongly influences DC measurements. We find an
intrinsic critical conductivity sigma_c=0.17e^2/h, virtually independent of
temperature and filling factor, and deviating significantly from the proposed
universal value 0.5e^2/h.

(treated as a $q\bar q$ moving at high relative transverse momentum,$\kappa_t
$). In the target rest frame,the space-time evolution of this reaction is
dominated by the process in which the high $\kappa_t$ $q\bar q$ component of
the pion wave function is formed before reaching the target. It then interacts
through two gluon exchange. In the approximation of keeping the leading order
in powers of $\alpha_s$ and all orders in
$\alpha_{s}\ln(\kappa_{t}^2/k_{0}^2),$ the amplitudes for other processes are
shown to be smaller at least by a power of $\alpha_{s}$. The resulting dominant
amplitude is proportional to $z(1-z) \kappa_t^{-4}$ ($z$ is the fraction
light-cone(+)momentum carried by the quark in the final state) times the skewed
gluon distribution of the target. For the pion scattering by a nuclear target,
this means that at fixed $x_{N}= 2\kappa_{t}^2/s$ (but $\kappa_{t}^2\to
\infty$) the nuclear process in which there is only a single interaction is the
most important one to contribute to the reaction. Thus in this limit color
transparency phenomena should occur.These findings are in accord with E971
experiment at FNAL. We also re-examine a potentially important nuclear multiple
scattering correction which is positive and $\propto A^{1/3}/\kappa_t^4$. The
meaning of the signal obtained from the experimental measurement of pion
diffraction into two jets is also critically examined and significant
corrections are identified.We show also that for values of $\kappa_t$ achieved
at fixed target energies, di-jet production by the e.m. field of the nucleus
leads to an insignificant correction which gets more important as $\kappa_t$
increases.

anomaly of conformally coupled matter fields. This model does not suffer from
the problem of contrived initial conditions that occurs in most models of
inflation driven by a scalar field. The universe can be nucleated
semi-classically by a cosmological instanton that is much larger than the
Planck scale provided there are sufficiently many matter fields. There are two
cosmological instantons: the four sphere and a new ``double bubble'' solution.
This paper considers a universe nucleated by the four sphere. The AdS/CFT
correspondence is used to calculate the correlation function for scalar and
tensor metric perturbations during the ensuing de Sitter phase. The analytic
structure of the scalar and tensor propagators is discussed in detail.
Observational constraints on the model are discussed. Quantum loops of matter
fields are shown to strongly suppress short scale metric perturbations, which
implies that short distance modifications of gravity would probably not be
observable in the cosmic microwave background. This is probably true for any
model of inflation provided there are sufficiently many matter fields. This
point is illustrated by a comparison of anomaly driven inflation in four
dimensions and in a Randall-Sundrum brane-world model.

infinite, and biinfinite Toeplitz-type systems. A crucial role plays the
off-diagonal decay behavior of Toeplitz matrices and their inverses. Classical
results of Gelfand et al. on commutative Banach algebras yield a general
characterization of this decay behavior. We then derive estimates for the
approximate solution of (bi)infinite Toeplitz systems by the finite section
method, showing that the approximation rate depends only on the decay of the
entries of the Toeplitz matrix and its condition number. Furthermore, we give
error estimates for the solution of doubly infinite convolution systems by
finite circulant systems. Finally, some quantitative results on the
construction of preconditioners via circulant embedding are derived, which
allow to provide a theoretical explanation for numerical observations made by
some researchers in connection with deconvolution problems.

attention. The first problem concerns the approximation of dual Gabor frames in

relations we derive a method to approximate the dual Gabor frame, that is much
simpler than previously proposed techniques. Furthermore it enables us to give
estimates for the approximation rate when the dimension of the finite model
approaches infinity. The second problem concerns the relation between the decay
of the window function $g$ and its dual $\gamma$. Based on results on
commutative Banach algebras and Laurent operators we derive a general condition
under which the dual $\gamma$ inherits the decay properties of $g$. The third
problem concerns the design of pulse shapes for orthogonal frequency division
multiplex (OFDM) systems for time- and frequency dispersive channels. In
particular, we provide a theoretical foundation for a recently proposed
algorithm to construct orthogonal transmission functions that are well
localized in the time-frequency plane.
