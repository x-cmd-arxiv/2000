resolve it. On one hand, a cross-correlation analysis of the WHAM H-alpha map
with the Tenerife 10 and 15 GHz maps shows that the well-known DIRBE correlated
microwave emission cannot be dominated by free-free emission. On the other
hand, recent high resolution observations in the 8-10 GHz range with the Green
Bank 140 ft telescope by Finkbeiner et al. failed to find the corresponding 8
sigma signal that would be expected in the simplest spinning dust models. So
what physical mechanism is causing this ubiquitous dust-correlated emission? We
argue for a model predicting that spinning dust is the culprit after all, but
that the corresponding small grains are well correlated with the larger grains
seen at 100 micron only on large angular scales. In support of this grain
segregation model, we find the best spinning dust template to involve higher
frequency maps in the range 12-60 micron, where emission from transiently
heated small grains is important. Upcoming CMB experiments such as ground-based
interferometers, MAP and Planck LFI with high resolution at low frequencies
should allow a definitive test of this model.

order to address the question of how the intrinsic molecular cloud properties
are influenced by massive star formation we have carried out radiative transfer
calculations based on the observed CO line ratios. The calculations suggest
that the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas is high in regions with
strong star formation and drops towards the outer molecular lobes with less
ongoing star formation. The location of the highest kinetic temperature is
coincident with that of the mid infrared peaks which trace emission from hot
dust. The hot gas is associated with low H2 densities while the cold gas in the
outer molecular lobes has high H2 densities. We find that CO intensities do not
trace H2 column densities well. Most of the molecular gas is distributed in a
double-lobed distribution which surrounds the starburst. A detailed analysis of
the conversion factor from CO intensity to H2 column density shows that X_CO
depends on the excitation conditions. We find X_CO ~ Sqrt(n_H2)/T_kin, as
expected for virialized clouds.

experiment collecting power, resulting in marginal statistics above $10^{14}$
eV, precisely the region where the ``knee'' of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum
is starting to develop. In contrast, indirect measurements using extensive air
showers can produce sufficient statistics in this region but generate elemental
measurements which have relatively large uncertainties. Here we discuss a
technique which has become possible through the use of modern ground-based
Cerenkov imaging detectors. We combine a measurement of the Cerenkov light
produced by the incoming cosmic-ray nucleus in the upper atmosphere with an
estimate of the total nucleus energy produced by the extensive air shower
initiated when the particle interacts deeper in the atmosphere. The emission
regions prior to and after the first hadronic interaction can be separated by
an imaging Cerenkov system with sufficient angular and temporal resolution.
Monte Carlo simulations indicate an expected charge resolution of $\Delta Z/Z
<5%$ for incident iron nuclei in the region of the ``knee'' of the cosmic-ray
energy spectrum. This technique also has the intriguing possibility to
unambiguously discover nuclei heavier than iron at energies above 10$^{14}$ eV.

the current photometric surveys detected binary microlensing events only for a
small fraction of the total events. The detection efficiency is especially low
for non-caustic crossing events, which comprise majority of the binary lensing
events, due to the absence of distinctive features in their light curves
combined with small deviations from the standard light curve of a single
point-mass event. In addition, even they are detected, it will be difficult to
determine the solution of the binary lens parameters due to the severe
degeneracy problem. In this paper, we investigate the properties of binary
lensing events expected when they are astrometrically observed by using high
precision interferometers. For this, we construct vector field maps of excess
centroid shifts, which represent the deviations of the binary lensing centroid
shifts from those of a single lensing events as a function of source position.
  From the analysis of the maps, we find that the excess centroid shifts are
substantial in a considerably large area around caustics. In addition, they
have characteristic sizes and directions depending strongly on the source
positions with respect to the caustics and the resulting trajectories of the
light centroid (astrometric trajectories) have distinctive features, which can
be distinguished from the deviations caused by other reasons. We classify the
types of the deviations and investigate where they occur. Due to the strong
dependency of the centroid shifts on the lens system geometry combined with the
distinctive features in the observed astrometric trajectories, astrometric
binary lensing observations will provide an important tool that can probe the
properties of Galactic binary lens population.

consistent with an interstellar origin, and there is no clear evidence for any
circumstellar contribution to these features. We find no spectral line or
feature that could elucidate the nature of these sources. Detailed modeling of
the silicate absorption features shows that they are best reproduced by the mu
Cep profile, which is typical of the interstellar medium, with tau(sil) \sim
2.9. The high spatial resolution mid-IR images show that three of the five

  A reddening law similar to that of Lutz (1999) but with silicate features

deredden the observed spectrophotometry. The dereddened energy distributions
are characterised by temperatures of 750-925 K, somewhat cooler than determined
from near IR data alone. Models of optically thin and geometrically thick dust

spectral, between the radio -- infrared and X-ray bands suggest that jet
synchrotron as well as inverse Compton emission could also be significantly
contributing at higher frequencies. We show here that, for reasonable
assumptions about the jet physical parameters, the broadband spectrum from
radio through X-rays can be almost entirely fit by synchrotron emission. We
explore a relatively simple model for a relativistic, adiabatically expanding
jet combined with a truncated thermal disk conjoined by an ADAF, in the context
of the recently discovered black hole binary XTE J1118+480. In particular, the
X-ray power-law emission can be explained as optically thin synchrotron
emission from a shock acceleration region in the innermost part of the jet,
with a cutoff determined by cooling losses. For synchrotron cooling-limited
particle acceleration, the spectral cutoff is a function only of dimensionless
plasma parameters and thus should be around a ``canonical'' value for sources
with similar plasma properties. It is therefore possible that non-thermal jet
emission is important for XTE J1118+480 and possibly other X-ray binaries in

reconstructing the large--scale structure of the universe from noisy, sparse

derived by requiring the linear minimal variance solution given the data and an
assumed prior model specifying the underlying field covariance matrix. However,
unlike the WF, the minimization is carried out with the added constraint of an
unbiased reconstructed mean field. The new estimator does not necessitate a
noise model to estimate the underlying field; however, such a model is required
for evaluating the errors at each point in space. The general application of
the UMV estimator is to predict the values of the reconstructed field in
un-sampled regions of space (e.g., interpolation in the unobserved Zone of
Avoidance), and to dynamically transform from one measured field to another
(e.g., inversion of radial peculiar velocities to over-densities). Here, we
provide two very simple applications of the method. The first, is to recover a
1D signal from noisy, convolved data with gaps, e.g., CMB time-ordered data.
The second application is a reconstruction of the density and 3D peculiar

paper we consider the effects of such a string network on the massive black
holes widely believed to inhabit the centers of many galaxies. As these black
holes traverse the universe together with their host galaxies, they would
intersect a large number of string segments. We argue that such segments would
become stuck to the black hole, and be stretched by the hole's motion.
Stretching the strings would cause significant deceleration of the black holes.
Although the black holes would probably not be removed from the galaxies
completely, they would be noticeably displaced from the galactic center of mass
-- by at least 5kpc. This displacement seems to be is contradiction to the
observational evidence.

of GRBs and fireball transients (FTs) into an L* galaxy like the Milky Way is
at the level of 10^40 ergs/s. This number, though with wide uncertainties
related to the internal or external shock efficiency, is sufficient to power
hadronic cosmic rays observed locally. The release of energy by the high-mass
progenitor stars of GRBs and FTs is sufficient to power the ultrahigh energy
cosmic rays, as already shown by Waxman and Vietri in 1995. It is sufficient to
power the cosmic rays above the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. Indeed, all
hadronic cosmic rays could originate from the high-mass (>~ 100 M_o) stars that
collapse to black holes, in the process forming GRBs and FTs. This source class
represents a new solution to the problem of cosmic-ray origin. The ~10^4 - 10^7
black holes made by these stars could make their presence known by radiating as
they accrete from the ISM, by microlensing background radiations, and by
forming luminous binary systems. Some unidentified EGRET sources could be
isolated black holes that accrete from the ISM. Better imaging and sensitivity
with GLAST and TeV observatories will test this model for the unidentified
gamma-ray sources, and this theory for cosmic-ray origin.

positions, angular sizes and absolute fluxes of 237 HII regions using a
semi-automated technique. From these we have constructed the luminosity and
diameter distribution functions.
  We repeat this process on the images after artificially reducing the linear
resolution to that typically obtained with ground based imaging. We find
substantial differences in the luminosity function and diameter distribution.
The measured internal properties, such as central surface brightness and radial
gradient are dominated by the PSF at linear resolutions less than roughly 40 pc
FWHM. From the ground such resolutions are currently only obtainable for the
nearest galaxies.
  We find evidence for two regimes of clustering of the HII regions and diffuse
emission, suggesting two different regimes of star formation in late type
spiral galaxies. This property in combination with the blending that occurs at
ground based resolutions might be responsible for the break in the luminosity
function which is usually found at log L=38.6 erg/s.
  From the high resolution HST data we find a luminosity function slope of
alpha=-1.74+/-0.08. We also observe a flattening at luminosities log L<36.7
erg/s. For the diameter distribution we find a characteristic scale of D0=29.2

derive a novel eigenvalue expansion for the second moment of the Hilbert-space

supersymmetry technique, we show that for $2k > m$, the average spectrum has
the shape of a semicircle, and the spectral fluctuations are of Wigner-Dyson

that for $k << m << l$, the spectral fluctuations are Poissonian. This is
consistent with the case $k = 1$ which can be solved explicitly. We construct
limiting ensembles which are either fully integrable or fully chaotic and show
that the $k$-body random ensembles lie between these two extremes. Combining
all these results we find that the spectral correlations for the embedded

heteroepitaxy is briefly discussed. It is argued that the way the surfactants
suppress the thermodynamic driving force for 3D islanding depends on the
mechanism of exchange of overlayer and surfactant atoms. If the overlayer atoms
occupy bulk-like positions provided by the outgoing surfactant dimers, as is
the case of Ge/Si(001), large atomic displacements are forcibly inhibited, and
the wetting of the overlayer by the substrate becomes nearly complete. This
complete wetting of the overlayer by the substrate means a zero thermodynamic
driving force for 3D islanding. Once the thermodynamics do not require 3D
islanding a change of the growth mode with the temperature should not be
observed. Thus, the temperature change of the growth mode appears as an
indication for the primary role of the kinetics, as in the case of Ge/Si(111).

$\alpha $, which can be interpreted as Brownian motion in the scale of time

simply related to the occupation time of the process, that is the length of

intervals between sign changes of the process form a renewal process in the

a local analysis of this distribution in the persistence region $(M_t\to\pm1)$,
as well as its asymptotic analysis in the regime where $\alpha$ is large. We
finally put the results thus found in perspective with those obtained by Dhar

in the approach to the Cauchy horizon. We argue that the semiclassical

naked singularity formation, because by then the curvature in the central

which the semiclassical approximation is valid, the total emitted energy is
about one Planck unit, and is not divergent. We also argue that back reaction
in this model does not become important so long as gravity can be treated
classically. It follows that the further evolution of the star will be
determined by quantum gravitational effects, and without invoking quantum
gravity it is not possible to say whether the star radiates away on a short
time scale or settles down into a black hole state.

a new kinematical region not present in the LO, which is responsible for the

  Regularization Schemes","18 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We study the supersymmetric kink with higher derivative and momentum cut-off
regularization schemes. We introduce the new momentum cut-off regularization
scheme which we call ``generalized momentum cut-off''. A new, explicit
computation for the central charge anomaly for this scheme is described in
detail. The calculation of the first order mass corrections for the bosonic and
supersymmetric kink within the momentum cut-off is presented in hep-th/0010051,
so that one can compare the one-loop central charge and mass computed
independently within the same regularization setup. We confirm that the BPS
bound is saturated in one loop level. Thus the Wilsonian momentum cut-off
regularization scheme is rehabilitated as a bona fide procedure for computing
quantum corrections in the topologically nontrivial backgrounds. We lead the
reader to the idea that a consistent regularization in general does not only
assume that one regulates loops properly, but also requires caution in defining
the total number of modes involved in the quantization of the theory. We also
study the higher-derivative regularization scheme of Shifman et al. in great
detail. We extend the Noether method for the case when the higher-derivatives
are present in the Lagrangian. The extensive discussion of the technical
aspects and the consistency of the higher-derivative scheme is given. We show
that higher-derivative regularization gives, in general, a nonlocal topological
current, which leads to the correct value of the anomaly in the central charge.
We also comment on the status of the dimensional regularization approach to the
computation of the central charge anomaly and kink mass.

triple point is a boundary point of three first-order phase transitions in the
dual sector of the Higgs scalar electrodynamics: The ""Coulomb"" and two
confinement phases meet together at this critical point. Considering the
arguments for the one-loop approximation validity in the region of parameters
around the triple point A we have obtained the following triple point values of
the running couplings: $(\lambda_{(A)}, g^2_{(A)})\approx(-13.4; 18.6)$, which
are independent of the electric charge influence and two--loop corrections to
$g^2_{run}$ with high accuracy of deviations. At the triple point the mass of
monopoles is equal to zero. The corresponding critical value of the electric
fine structure constant turns out to be $\alpha_{crit} =
\pi/g^2_{(A)}\approx{0.17}$ by the Dirac relation. This value is close to the
$\alpha_{crit}^{lat}\approx{0.20\pm 0.015}$, which in a U(1) lattice gauge
theory corresponds to the phase transition between the ""Coulomb"" and

physics. We consider here a possible solution within the Standard Model
framework based on a nonabelian generalization of electric-magnetic duality.
First, nonabelian duality says that dual to the colour (electric) symmetry
SU(3), there is a ``colour magnetic symmetry'' $\widetilde{SU}(3)$, which by a
result of 't~Hooft is spontaneously broken and can thus play the role of the
""horizontal symmetry"" of generations. Second, nonabelian duality suggests the
manner this symmetry is broken with frame vectors in internal symmetry space
acting as Higgs fields. As a result, mass matrices factorize leading to fermion
mass hierarchy. A calculation to first order gives mixing (CKM and MNS)
matrices in general agreement with experiment. In particular, quark mixing is
seen naturally to be weak compared with leptons, while within the lepton
sector, $\mu-\tau$ mixing turns out near maximal but $e-\tau$ mixing small,
just as seen in recent $\nu$ oscillation experiments. In addition, the scheme
leads to many testable predictions ranging from rare FCNC meson decays and
$\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei to cosmic ray air showers above $10^{20}$ eV.

strengthens the result of Arnal, Benamor, and Cahen.
  Our main result is to compute, for G classical, the star product of a
momentum function $\mu_x$ with any function f. We find $\mu_x\star
f=\mu_xf+\half\{\mu_x,f\}t+\Lambda^x(f)t^2$. For $\g$ different from
$sp_n(\C)$, $\Lambda^x$ is not a differential operator. Instead $\Lamda^x$ is
the left quotient of an explicit order 4 algebraic differential operator $D^x$
by an order 2 invertible diagonalizable operator. Precisely,
$\Lambda^x=-{1/4}\frac{1}{E'(E'+1)}D^x$ where $E'$ is a positive shift of the
Euler vector field. Thus $\mu_x\star f$ is not local in f.
  Using $\star$ we construct a positive definite hermitian inner product on
$Sg/I$. The Hilbert space completion of $Sg/I$ is then a unitary representation

formation of a long lived resonance. One crucial physical insight that emerges

body wavefunction, thus upsetting the delicate interference process necessary
to form a resonance in the first place. This is the physical reason for not
