spectrograph OASIS of the M 31 double nucleus at a spatial resolution better
than 0.5 arcsec FWHM. These data are used to derive the two-dimensional stellar
kinematics within the central 2 arcsec. Archival WFPC2/HST images are revisited
to perform a photometric decomposition of the nuclear region. We also present
STIS/HST kinematics obtained from the archive. The luminosity distribution of
the central region is well separated into the respective contributions of the
bulge, the nucleus including P1 and P2, and the so-called UV peak. We then show
that the axis joining P1 and P2, the two local surface brightness maxima, does
not coincide with the kinematic major-axis, which is also the major-axis of the
nuclear isophotes (excluding P1). We also confirm that the velocity dispersion
peak is offset by ~ 0.2 arcsec from the UV peak, assumed to mark the location
of the supermassive black hole. The newly reduced STIS/HST velocity and
dispersion profiles are then compared to OASIS and other published kinematics.
We find significant offsets with previously published data. Simple parametric
models are then built to successfully reconcile all the available kinematics.
We finally interpret the observations using new N-body simulations. The nearly
keplerian nuclear disk of M31 is subject to a natural m=1 mode, with a very
slow pattern speed (3 km/s/pc for M_BH = 7 10^7~\Msun), that can be maintained
during more than a thousand dynamical times. The resulting morphology and
kinematics of the mode can reproduce the M~31 nuclear-disk photometry and mean
stellar velocity, including the observed asymmetries. It requires a central

cluster around 7, after correction for the presence of primordial helium. But
for several cases different, often larger, values are found. For galaxies that

The excitation of the wake follows from standard linear theory including the

dimensionless viscosities [alpha] of order dex(-4) to dex(-3) result. We

positive and negative images of the integrated emission. The geometric
structure of the high-emission regions was found to be filamentary, whereas the
geometric structure of the low-emission (intercloud) regions was found to be
patchy and round. This result suggests that compressive events formed the
high-emission regions, and expansion events, whether from explosions or
turbulence, formed the low-emission regions. The character of the structure was
also investigated as a function of scale using unsharp masks.

The universality and large total mass range of the power law portion of the IMF

patterns and formation times of young clusters suggest a further connection to
turbulence. There is also a similarity between the characteristic mass at the
lower end of the power law and the minimum self-gravitating mass in a typical

comes from star formation in self-gravitating cloud pieces that are formed by
compressible turbulence. Timing constraints involving cloud destruction and
competition for gas might limit the upper stellar mass to several hundred suns.
This upper limit has to be less than the mass of a clump that has a dynamical
time equal to several times the dynamical time of the characteristic mass. The
smallest stars and brown dwarfs may not come directly from cloud clumps, which
are not self-gravitating at this mass in the cloudy phase, but from collapsed

of weak and strong, elastic and inelastic cotunneling are analyzed for
quantum-dot systems (QDS) with few-level, nearly-degenerate, and continuous
electronic spectra. We find that in contrast to sequential tunneling where the
noise is either Poissonian (due to uncorrelated tunneling events) or
sub-Poissonian (suppressed by charge conservation on the QDS), the noise in
inelastic cotunneling can be super-Poissonian due to switching between QDS
states carrying currents of different strengths. In the case of weak
cotunneling we prove a non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem which
leads to a universal expression for the noise-to-current ratio (Fano factor).
In order to investigate strong cotunneling we develop a microscopic theory of
cotunneling based on the density-operator formalism and using the projection
operator technique. The master equation for the QDS and the expressions for
current and noise in cotunneling in terms of the stationary state of the QDS
are derived and applied to QDS with a nearly degenerate and continuous

ratios of the two-body charmless hadronic decays of $B_u$ and $B_d$ mesons
induced by the new gluonic and electroweak charged-Higgs penguin diagrams in
the general two-Higgs doublet models (models I, II and III). Within the
considered parameter space, we find that: (a) the new physics effects from new
gluonic penguin diagrams strongly dominate over those from the new $\gamma$-
and $Z^0$- penguin diagrams; (b) in models I and II, new physics contributions
to most studied B meson decay channels are rather small in size: from -15% to
20%; (c) in model III, however, the new physics enhancements to the
penguin-dominated decay modes can be significant, $\sim (30 -200)%$, and
therefore are measurable in forthcoming high precision B experiments; (d) the
new physics enhancements to ratios ${\cal B}(B \to K \etap)$ are significant in
model III, $\sim (35 -70)%$, and hence provide a simple and plausible new
physics interpretation for the observed unexpectedly large $B \to K \etap $
decay rates; (e) the theoretical predictions for ${\cal B}(B \to K^+ \pi)$ and
${\cal B}(B \to K^0 \pi^+)$ in model III are still consistent with the data
within $2\sigma$ errors; (f) the significant new physics enhancements to the
branching ratios of $B \to K^0 \pi^0, K^* \eta, K^{*+} \pi^-, K^+ \phi, K^{*0}
\omega, K^{*+} \phi$ and $K^{*0} \phi$ decays are helpful to improve the
agreement between the data and the theoretical predictions; (g) the theoretical

consistent with experimental measurements and upper limits ($90% C.L.$)

  highly excited states","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  Coherent time evolution of highly excited Rydberg states in Rb (98 < n < 150)
under pulsed electric field in high slew-rate regime was investigated with the
field ionization detection. The electric field necessary to ionize the Rydberg
states was found to take discrete values successively depending on the slew
rate. Specifically the slew-rate dependence of the ionization field varies with
the quantum defect value of the states, i.e. with the energy position of the
states relative to the adjacent manifold. This discrete transitional behavior
of the ionization field observed for the first time is considered to be a
manifestation of the strong coherence effect in the time evolution of the
Rydberg states in pulsed electric field and opens a new effective way to
stringently select a low-l state from the nearby states by field ionization.

  Fine Structure Constant","4 pages, Revised Tex file",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Antoniadis, Mazur and Mottola (AMM) two years ago computed the intrinsic
Hausdorff dimension of spacetime at the infrared fixed point of the quantum
conformal factor in 4D Gravity. The fractal dimension was determined by the
coefficient of the Gauss-Bonnet topological term associated with the conformal
gravitational anomaly and was found to be greater than 4. It is explicitly
shown how one can relate the value of the Hausdorff dimension computed by AMM
to the universal dimensional fluctuation of spacetime $\epsilon $ given by
$\phi^3/2$, where $\phi$ is the Golden Mean $0.618..$. Based on the infrared
scaling limit of the theory and using recent Renormalization Group arguments by
El Naschie, we conjecture that the unknown coefficient $Q^2$, associated with
the four dimensional gravitational conformal anomaly, could be precisely equal
to the inverse fine structure constant values ranging between $137.036 $ and
137.081. Our results generate decimal digits up to any $arbitrary$ number.

  based on distributed entanglement","5 pages; typeset in RevTeX",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.65.052317",,"quant-ph",,"  Recent work has raised the possibility that quantum information theory
techniques can be used to synchronize atomic clocks nonlocally. One of the
proposed algorithms for quantum clock synchronization (QCS) requires
distribution of entangled pure singlets to the synchronizing parties. Such
remote entanglement distribution normally creates a relative phase error in the
distributed singlet state which then needs to be purified asynchronously. We
present a fully relativistic analysis of the QCS protocol which shows that
asynchronous entanglement purification is not possible, and, therefore, that
the proposed QCS scheme remains incomplete. We discuss possible directions of
research in quantum information theory which may lead to a complete, working
QCS protocol.
