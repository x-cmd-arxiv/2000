variability-luminosity relation for long-duration GRBs, is compared with the
cosmic star formation rate. If GRBs are related to the collapse of massive
stars, one expects the GRB rate to be approximately proportional to the star
formation rate. We found that these two rates have similar slopes at low
redshift. This suggests that GRBs do indeed track the star formation rate of
the Universe, which in turn implies that the formation rate of massive stars
that produce GRBs is proportional to the total star formation rate. It also
implies that we might be able to use GRBs as a probe of the cosmic star
formation rate at high redshift. We find that the cosmic star formation rate
inferred from the variability-luminosity relation increases steeply with
redshift at z > 3. This is in apparent contrast to what is derived from
measurements of the cosmic star formation rate at high redshift from optical
observations of field galaxies, suggesting that much high-z star formation is
being missed in the optical surveys, even after corrections for dust extinction
have been made.

Thackeray,

least, these states have occurred regularly in the 2020 day cycle proposed by
Damineli et al. They last about 10 percent of each cycle. Early slit spectra
(1899-1919) suggest that at that time the object was always in a low state.
JHKL photometry is reported for the period 1994-2000. This shows that the
secular increase in brightness found in 1972-94 has continued and its rate has
increased at the shorter wavelengths. Modulation of the infrared brightness in
a period near 2020 days continues. There is a dip in the JHKL light curves near
1998.0, coincident with a dip in the X-ray light curve. Evidence is given that
this dip in the infrared repeats in the 2020 day cycle. As suggested by
Whitelock & Laney, the dip is best interpreted as an eclipse phenomenon in an
interacting binary system; the object eclipsed being a bright region (`hot
spot'), possibly on a circumstellar disc or produced by interacting stellar
winds. The eclipse coincides in phase and duration with the state of low
excitation. It is presumably caused by a plasma column and/or by one of the
stars in the system.

the metrics and variations in $c$ associated with the counterpart of black

that $c$ goes to zero or infinity (depending on parameter signs) at the
horizon. We show how this implies that, with appropriate parameters, observers
are prevented from entering the horizon. Concomitantly stellar collapse must
end in a ``Schwarzchild radius'' remnant. We then find formulae for
gravitational light deflection, gravitational redshift, radar echo delay, and
the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, highlighting how these may differ
distinctly from their Einstein counterparts but still evade experimental
constraints. The main tell-tale signature of this theory is the prediction of
the observation of a different value for the fine structure constant, $\alpha$,
in spectral lines formed in the surface of stars. We close by mentioning a
variety of new classical and quantum effects near stars, such as aging
gradients and particle production.

employed in industrial processing, prior to the deposition of ferroelectric
films. The comparison between annealed and non-annealed electrodes clearly
revealed strong interfacial effects due to interdiffusion and oxidation of Ti,
especially at the Pt-Ti interface. Migration of Ti into the Pt-layer results in
a clear shift of the critical angle due to enclosure of TiO(2-x) within the
Pt-layer. The heterogeneous distribution of TiO(2-x) suggests a diffusion
mechanism mainly along the Pt-grain boundaries. At the SiO2 interface a
relatively weakly oxidized, remaining Ti-layer of 20 Angstroem could be found,
which is most probably correlated with the remaining adhesion to the substrate.

gravity is constructed by gauging the symmetry $U(1,D-1)$. The resulting action
gives one specific form of nonsymmetric gravity. In contrast to other theories
