reflection nebulae (e.g. Roberts 22). The IRAS colour--colour diagram separates
the sample into different types of objects. One group may contain the
progenitors to the (few) extreme bipolar planetary nebulae. Two objects show
colours and chemistry very similar to the planetary nebulae with late IR-[WC]
stars. One object is a confirmed close binary.
  A model is presented consisting of an outer AGB wind which is swept up by a
faster post-AGB wind, with either wind being non-spherically symetric. The
interface of the two winds is shown to exhibit a linear relation between
velocity and distance from the star. The OH data confirms the predicted linear
velocity gradients, and reveals torus-like, uniformly expanding components. All
sources are discussed in detail using optical/HST images where available. ISO
data for Roberts 22 reveal a chemical dichotomy, with both crystalline
silicates and PAHs features being present. IRAS 16342-3814 shows a dense torus;
HST data shows four point-like sources located symmetrically around the nebula,
near the outer edge of the dense torus.
  Lifetimes for the bipolar OH/IR stars are shown to be in excess of 10^4 yr,
longer than normal post-AGB timescales. This suggests that the disks are
near-stationary. We suggest that accretion from such a disk slows down the

like the bright X-ray knots and filaments or the primary blast wave, but is
spread over the whole remnant with a rather flat hardness ratio of the 8-10 and
10-15 keV energy bands. This result does not support an interpretation of the
hard X-radiation as synchrotron emission produced in the primary shock, in
which case a limb brightened shell of hard X-ray emission close to the primary
shock front is expected. In fact a weak rim of emission near the primary shock
front is discernable in the hardest X-ray image but it contains only a few

the rich cluster Abell 2199 in the Lex/B (69 - 190 eV) filter passband. The
soft excess radial trend (SERT), shown by a plot against cluster radius $r$ of
the percentage EUV emission $\eta$ observed above the level expected from the
hot intracluster medium (ICM), behaves as a simple function of $r$ which
decreases monotonically towards $r = 0$; it smoothly turns negative at $r \sim$
6 arcmin, inwards of this radius the EUV is absorbed by cold matter with a
line-of-sight column density of $\geq$ 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. The
centre of absorption is offset from that of the emission by $\sim$ 1 arcmin,

together provide strong evidence for a centrally concentrated but cluster-wide
distribution of clumps of cold gas which co-exist with warm gas of similar
spatial properties. Further, the simultaneous modeling of EUV and X-ray data
requires a warm component even within the region of absorption. The phenomenon

absolute kinematics of radio source components in the 13 members of the
complete S5 polar cap sample. For each epoch, all the radio sources are
observed at the same frequency for 24 hours in total. Bootstrapping techniques
are used to phase-connect the data jointly for the 13 objects throughout the
observations. An accurate registration of the maps of the radio sources at
different frequencies will allow a study of jet components with unprecedented

extended in the future to other regions of the sky and eventually lead to

(e.g. ACES on International Space Station) that will fly on Earth orbit laser
cooled atomic clocks, providing a time-keeping accuracy of the order of
5~10^{-17} in fractional frequency. We show that to such accuracy, the theory
of frequency transfer between Earth and Space must be extended from the
currently known relativistic order 1/c^2 (which has been needed in previous
space experiments such as GP-A) to the next relativistic correction of order
1/c^3. We find that the frequency transfer includes the first and second-order
Doppler contributions, the Einstein gravitational red-shift and, at the order
1/c^3, a mixture of these effects. As for the time transfer, it contains the
standard Shapiro time delay, and we present an expression also including the
first and second-order Sagnac corrections. Higher-order relativistic
corrections, at least O(1/c^4), are numerically negligible for time and
frequency transfers in these experiments, being for instance of order 10^{-20}
in fractional frequency. Particular attention is paid to the problem of the
frequency transfer in the two-way experimental configuration. In this case we
find a simple theoretical expression which extends the previous formula (Vessot
et al. 1980) to the next order 1/c^3. In the Appendix we present the detailed
proofs of all the formulas which will be needed in such experiments.

that there exist Apollonian packings which have strong integrality properties,
in which all circles in the packing have integer curvatures and rational
centers such that (curvature)$\times$(center) is an integer vector. This series
of papers explain such properties. A {\em Descartes configuration} is a set of
four mutually tangent circles with disjoint interiors. We describe the space of
all Descartes configurations using a coordinate system $\sM_\DD$ consisting of
those $4 \times 4$ real matrices $\bW$ with $\bW^T \bQ_{D} \bW = \bQ_{W}$ where

Apollonian packing form an orbit under a certain finitely generated discrete
group, the {\em Apollonian group}. This group consists of $4 \times 4$ integer

The basic ideea of the present approach is to separate the radial(fission)

transversal vibrations(bending) of the fragments. The distance between the
centers of the two fragments is fixed by the requirement that the energy
released in the fission reaction $Q$, equals the sum of quantum zero-energies
of radial and transversal modes and the total excitation energy $E^*$. Using a

in the potential in order to insure a quasi-stable configuration of the system.
The model is applied to three nuclear molecules, namely $^{96}$Sr + $^{10}$Be +
$^{146}$Ba, $^{108}$Mo + $^{10}$Be + $^{134}$Te and $^{112}$Ru + $^{10}$Be +
$^{130}$Sn.

chiral quark model whose hyperfine interaction is based on Goldstone-boson
exchange. For the decay mechanism a modified version of the 3P0 model is
employed. Our primary aim is to provide a further test of the recently proposed
Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model. We compare the predictions
for \pi and \eta decay widths with experiment and also with results from a
traditional one-gluon-exchange constituent quark model. The differences between
nonrelativistic and semirelativistic versions of the constituent quark models
are outlined. We also discuss the sensitivity of the results on the
parametrization of the meson wave function entering the 3P0 model.

moment (EDM). Parity and time reversal violating (P,T-odd) nuclear forces
generate a mixed P,T-odd nuclear polarizability beta_{ik} (defined by an energy
shift U = -beta_{ik} E_{i}H_{k}, E is electric field and H magnetic field). The
interaction of atomic electrons with beta_{ik} produces an atomic EDM. We
performed an analytical calculation of the P,T-odd nuclear polarizability and
estimated the value for the induced atomic EDM. The measurements of atomic EDMs
can provide information about P,T-odd nuclear forces and test models of
CP-violation.

deformed systems, rotational bands of different isospin may be expected at low
excitation energies. We have investigated, in a simple model space, the
influence of the isospin-breaking Coulomb interaction on the degree of
chaoticity of these rotational bands. The statistical measures used rely on an
analysis of level-spacing distributions, which are extremely difficult to
measure experimentally. We show, however, that the overlap intergrals between
states of similar frequency reflect well the degree of chaoticity. This
quantity is closely related to the experimentally more accessible gamma-decay
``spreading width''.

such as the localization and disappearance of interference, we invoke the
adiabatic quantum entanglement between its collective states(such as that of
the center-of-mass (C.M)) and its inner states based on our recent
investigation. Under the adiabatic limit that motion of C.M dose not excite the
transition of inner states, it is shown that the wave function of the
macroscopic object can be written as an entangled state with correlation
between adiabatic inner states and quasi-classical motion configurations of the
C.M. Since the adiabatic inner states are factorized with respect to each parts
composing the macroscopic object, this adiabatic separation can induce the
quantum decoherence. This observation thus provides us with a possible solution
to the Schroedinger cat paradox

game of making guesses on identities of quantum states that are in one of two
given nonorthogonal states: if Bob makes a correct (an incorrect) guess on the
identity of a quantum state that Alice has sent, he wins (loses). It is shown
that the proposed scheme is secure against the nonentanglement attack. It can
also be shown heuristically that the scheme is secure in the case of the
entanglement attack.

allow the creation of entangled two-photon states and have unique advantages

absorption; (iii) a number of PCs can be combined in a network.
