  analysis, changes in response to referee report",,"10.1086/321507",,"astro-ph",,"  The failure of purely gravitational models of X-ray cluster formation to
reproduce basic observed properties of the local cluster population suggests
the need for one or more additional physical processes operating on the
intracluster medium (ICM). We present results from 84 moderate resolution gas
dynamic simulations designed to systematically investigate the effects of
preheating - an initially elevated ICM adiabat - on the resultant, local X-ray
size-temperature, luminosity-temperature and ICM mass-temperature relations.
Seven sets of twelve simulations are performed for a LambdaCDM cosmology, each
set characterized by a different initial entropy level S_i. The slopes of the
observable relations steepen monotonically as S_i is increased. Observed slopes
for all three relations are reproduced by models with S_i: 55-150 keV cm^2,
levels that compare favorably to empirical determinations of core ICM entropy
by Lloyd-Davies, Ponman & Cannon. The redshift evolution for the case of a
locally successful model with S_i = 106 keV cm^2 is presented. At temperatures
kT > 3 keV, little or no evolution in physical isophotal sizes or bolometric
luminosities is expected to z < 1. The ICM mass at fixed T is lower at higher z
as expected in the canonical evolution model. ICM mass fractions show a mild T
dependence. Clusters with T > 3 keV contain ICM mass fractions depressed by
modest amounts (< 25%) below the cosmic mean baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m;
hot clusters subject to preheating remain good tracers of the cosmic mix of
clustered mass components.

side 100Mpc, in two versions of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony: the
standard, Omega=1 SCDM model and the flat, Omega=0.3 LCDM model. Over 2000
galaxies form in each of these simulations. We examine the rate at which gas
cools and condenses into dark matter halos. This roughly tracks the cosmic star
formation rate inferred from observations at various redshifts. Galaxies in the
simulations form gradually over time in the hierarchical fashion characteristic
of the CDM cosmogony. In the LCDM model, substantial galaxies first appear at
z=5 and the population builds up rapidly until z=1 after which the rate of
galaxy formation declines as cold gas is consumed and the cooling time of hot
gas increases. In both cosmologies, the present-day K-band luminosity function
of the simulated galaxies resembles observations. The galaxy autocorrelation
functions differ significantly from those of the dark matter. At the present
epoch there is little bias in either model between galaxies and dark matter on
large scales, but a significant anti-bias on scales of 1Mpc/h and a positive
bias on scales of 100kpc/h. The galaxy correlation function evolves little with
redshift in the range z=0-3, and depends on the luminosity of the galaxy
sample. The projected pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies is much
lower than that of the dark matter on scales less than 2Mpc/h. Applying a
virial mass estimator to the largest galaxy clusters recovers the cluster
virial masses in an unbiased way. (Abridged)

multi-color classification (6 mistakes among 151 objects with R<24). We also
determine the accuracy of the multi-color redshifts which are rather good for
galaxies (sigma_z = 0.03) and useful for quasars. We find the classification

nitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. An even more
intriguing possible line identification is complicated Balmer and He I lines,
which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallow
density gradient. We also show that very early spectra such as those presented

estimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum is
very blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot be

  Herbig-Haro Outflows and their Shocks","14 pages, incl. 3 figures; accepted by PASP",,"10.1086/318611",,"astro-ph",,"  (modified for brevity) It is important to determine whether the observed bow
shocks in the working surfaces of Herbig-Haro outflows has lead to a
destruction of dust grains and consequently to a change in the gas phase metal
abundances (say of Fe) in the cooling regions of HH bow shocks. Detailed
studies are currently available for only 5 HH outflows (Beck-Winchatz et al.\
1996), due to the large observational and theoretical effort required to
determine metal abundances in HH objects.
  Information about metal abundances in more HH objects is badly needed. We
therefore use a very approximate method by introducing a ""characteristic
number"", A_me, whose definition is based only on often observed line fluxes. We
find a good correlation between A_me and the Fe abundance for the 5
well-studied HH objects. We use this correlation to determine approximate
values of the gas phase Fe abundance in 13 additional high excitation and in 3
additional low excitation HH objects.
  Of the 16 high excitation HH objects studied, there are 6 which approximately
agree with normal population I abundance (i.e., no depletion due to dust
formation). The remaining 10 show some Fe gas phase depletion which never gets
larger than by a factor of 2.5. This result is in agreement with our
qualitative expectations that fast shocks efficiently destroy dust grains. Of
the 5 low excitation HH objects studied, there are 4 which, unexpectedly, show
a normal population I abundance. In low excitation objects, one might expect
strong gas phase Fe depletion (showing the unchanged molecular cloud
composition), unless the matter has previously gone through shocks of much
higher shock velocities.

10 percent of the period. Earlier slit spectra (1899 -1919) suggest that the

be connected with the gradual brightening of eta Car through most of the 20th
century. (2) FeII and [FeII] emission in Mira variables is probably
chromospheric. It would be important to understand how this is excited and its
relation to mass loss and dust formation in Miras. (3) Declines of RCB stars
are due to eclipses by dust clouds. At such times a rich emission line spectrum
from the outer atmosphere of the star is seen. The quantitative study of the
changes in this spectrum as more and more of the star is eclipsed should yield

a Salpeter initial mass function, modest or negligible dust reddening, and no
intrinsic HI photoelectric absorption. Fading starbursts in which star
formation has ceased for 10^7 yr or more cannot reproduce the observed flux
shortward of 1 Ryd.The escape fraction of H-ionizing photons must be close to
100 percent for the observed sample of LBGs. The spectrum of ionizing photons
produced by a stellar population with ongoing star formation is similar to that
of QSOs between 1 and 3 Ryd, becomes softer between 3 and 4 Ryd and drops
sharply shortward of 4 Ryd. A galaxy-dominated UV background appears
inconsistent with the observed HeII/HI opacity ratio at z=2.4, but might be
able to explain the SiIV/CIV abundances measured at z>3 in absorption spectra.
A scenario may be emerging where star-forming galaxies reionized intergalactic
hydrogen at $z>6$ and dominate the 1 Ryd metagalactic flux at z>3, with
quasi-stellar sources taking over at low redshifts. If the large amplitude of
the H-ionizing flux estimated by Steidel etal is correct, hydrodynamical
simulations of structure formation in the IGM require a baryon density (to
explain the observed Lyalpha opacity in absorption spectra) which is similar to
or larger than that favoured by recent CMB experiments, and is inconsistent
with standard nucleosynthesis values.

galaxies, only one object (10% of total) was detected. The HI absorption in
these objects is likely to come from a nuclear disk, as found for other
galaxies of this type. The low detection rate is consistent with the hypothesis
(as suggested by optical and X-ray data) that the ``standard'' pc scale,
geometrically thick torus is not required in low-luminosity radio galaxies. In
the case of FR type-II powerful radio galaxies, no HI absorption has been
detected in broad line radio galaxies, while three out of four narrow-line
radio galaxies have been detected (the one non-detection having quite a high
upper limit). All these are compact or small radio galaxies. To first order
this is consistent with the predictions of the unified schemes, assuming that
the HI absorption is due to an obscuring torus. However, the indications of
this being the only cause of the absorption are not very strong. In particular,
we find that in two of the three detected objects that the HI is blueshifted
compared to the systemic velocity. In the third galaxy (PKS 1549-79) two
redshift systems (from the optical lines) are found. The uncertainty in the
systemic velocity derived from optical lines is discussed. Finally, we find a
tendency for radio galaxies with a strong component of young stellar population
and far-IR emission to show HI absorption. The overall richer ISM that is
likely to be present in these galaxies may be a factor in producing the
absorption.

ionized gas in the regions where most metal absorption lines are formed. A
simplified model consisting of Region 1) a plane-parallel ionization bounded
region illuminated by an internal radiation field, and Region 2) a neutral
region with a negligible metal content is considered. We calculate
photoionization equilibrium models for region 1, and constrain the ionization
parameter by the observed N(Al III)/N(Si II) column density ratio. Under these

taken into account, the element abundance ratios in DLAs are quite consistent
with those observed in Milky Way stars and in H II regions of local
low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies. In particular we cannot exclude
the same primary N origin in both DLAs and metal-poor galaxies. No depletion of
heavy elements on dust grains needs to be invoked, although our models do not
exclude the presence of little depletion. Although highly simplified and
relying on the strong assumption of a significantly lower metal content in
region 2, our model appears to be supported by recent data on a local DLA and
it is not in contradiction with the current knowledge on high redshift DLAs. If
correct, it offers a clear simplification in the understanding of heavy element

embedded in a high density environment that is subjected continually to
perturbations reflecting the presence of other nearby galaxies and/or
incoherent internal pulsations. The analysis is similar to earlier analyses of
energy relaxation induced by binary encounters between nearby stars and between
stars and giant molecular clouds in that the perturbations are idealised as a
sum of near-random events which can be modeled as diffusion and dynamical
friction. However, the analysis differs in one important respect: because the
time scale associated with these perturbations need not be short compared with
the characteristic dynamical time t_D for stars in the original galaxy, the
diffusion process cannot be modeled as resulting from a sequence of
instantaneous kicks, i.e., white noise. Instead, the diffusion is modeled as
resulting from random kicks of finite duration, i.e., coloured noise
characterised by a nonzero autocorrelation time t_c. A detailed analysis of
coloured noise generated by sampling an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leads to a
simpling scaling in terms of t_c and an effective diffusion constant D.
Interpreting D and t_c following early work by Chandrasekhar (1941) (the
`nearest neighbour approximation') implies that, for realistic choices of
parameter values, energy relaxation associated with an external environment
and/or internal pulsations could be important on times short compared with the
age of the Universe.

specialize attention to the doped Mott insulator phase of the Hubbard model,

invariant Stratonovich-Hubbard field is introduced to decouple the static spin
components of the interaction at each site. Charge degrees of freedom are then
treated by ``slave'' Hartree-Fock in the presence of a spatially varying random
spin field. The effective action reduces to a classical Heisenberg model at
half filling, insuring that the system has (i) finite-range order at T>0 with
an exponentially diverging correlation length and (ii) a one-electron
Mott-Hubbard gap in the presence of disorder. Away from half-filling properties
are determined by strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations in the amplitude and
orientation of the local spin fields. The saddle point equations of the theory
at zero temperature reduce to inhomogeneous Hartree-Fock, so that disordering
of domain walls at finite temperature is in principle included. We present
preliminary small system results for the intermediate and large interaction

of the fatty acid alkyl chains, $n$ ($n = 15, 17, 19, 21$). The monolayers were

cells of various thickness that were filled with MBBA in the nematic phase. The
mechanism of relaxation from the flow-induced quasi-planar to the
surface-induced homeotropic alignment was studied for the four decreases
linearly with increasing the length of the alkyl chains $n$ which suggests that
the Langmuir-Blodgett film plays a role in the phenomenon. This fact was
confirmed by a sensitive estimation of the anchoring strength of MBBA on the
fatty acid monolayers after anchoring breaking which takes place at the
transition between two electric-field--induced turbulent states, denoted as
DSM1 and DSM2. It was found that the threshold electric field for the anchoring
breaking, which can be considered as a measure of the anchoring strength, also
decreases linearly as $n$ increases. Both methods thus possess a high
sensitivity in resolving small differences in anchoring strength. In cells
coated with mixed Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of two fatty acids ($n=15$ and

which is adapted to accelerating observers in this background. The solutions

dust collapse has been investigated. This radiation is due to the particle
creation in a curved spacetime. In this discussion, the central role is played
by the mapping formula between the incoming and the outgoing null coordinates.
For the self-similar model, this mapping formula has been derived analytically.
But for the model with $C^{\infty}$ density profile, the mapping formula has
been obtained only numerically. In the present paper, we argue that the
singular nature of the mapping is determined by the local geometry around the
point at which the singularity is first formed. If this is the case, it would
be natural to expect that the mapping formula can be derived analytically. In
the present paper, we analytically rederive the same mapping formula for the
model with $C^{\infty}$ density profile that has been earlier derived using a
numerical technique.

string breaking also requires using different operators. A known string

the value of the string amplitude with a circular boundary to all orders in

theory. We find that the gauge theory calculation, for large g^2 N and to all
orders in the 1/N^2 expansion does agree with the leading string theory
calculation, to all orders in g_s and to lowest order in alpha'. We also find a
relation between the expectation value of any closed smooth Wilson loop and the

infinity, and compare this result, again successfully, with string theory.

producing extensions of $F/K$ in which all places of degree one split

either to one chosen rational place, or entirely to non-rational places. We
then apply these methods to the related problem of building asymptotically good
towers of function fields. We construct examples of towers of function fields
in which all rational places split completely throughout the tower. We
construct Abelian towers with this property also.
  Furthermore, all of the above are done explicitly, ie., we give generators

  31.07-05.08, 2000",,,"SPbU-IP-00-17","math.QA",,"  Serious difficulties arise in the construction of chains of twists for
symplectic Lie algebras. Applying the canonical chains of extended twists to
deform the Hopf algebras U(sp(N)) one is forced to deal only with improper
chains (induced by the U(sl(N)) subalgebras). In the present paper this problem
is solved. For chains of regular injections the sets of maximal extended
jordanian twists F_{E,k} are considered. We prove that there exists for
U(sp(N)) the twist F_{B,k} composed of the factors F_{E,k}. It is demonstrated
that the twisting procedure deforms the space of the primitive subalgebra
sp(N-1). The recursive algorithm for such deformation is found. This
construction generalizes the results obtained for orthogonal classical Lie
algebras and demonstrates the universality of primitivization effect for
regular chains of subalgebras. For the chain of maximal length the twists
F_{B,k,max} become full, their carriers contain the Borel subalgebra B(sp(N)).
Using such twisting procedures one can obtain the explicit quantizations for a
wide class of classical r-matrices. As an example the full chain of extended
twists for U(sp(3)) is considered.

Usually sand piles are characterized by a decreasing integer partition and
grain moves are described in terms of transitions between such partitions. We
study here four main transition rules. The more classical one, introduced by
Brylawski (1973) induces a lattice structure $L_B (n)$ (called dominance
ordering) between decreasing partitions of a given integer n. We prove that a
more restrictive transition rule, called SPM rule, induces a natural partition
of L_B (n) in suborders, each one associated to a fixed point for SPM rule. In
the second part, we extend the SPM rule in a natural way and obtain a model
called Chip Firing Game (Goles and Kiwi, 1993). We prove that this new model
has interesting properties: the induced order is a lattice, a natural greedoid
can be associated to the model and it also defines a strongly convergent game.
In the last section, we generalize the SPM rule in another way and obtain other
lattice structure parametrized by some t: L(n,t), which form for -n+2 <= t <= n
a decreasing sequence of lattices. For each t, we characterize the fixed point
of L(n,t) and give the value of its maximal sized chain's lenght. We also note
that L(n,-n+2) is the lattice of all compositions of n.

stay-clear from the beam. Two possible schemes for the spoilers are considered:
one in which the spoilers are capable of tolerating a certain number of
damaging interceptions per collider run (""consumable"" spoilers), and one in
which the spoilers are potentially damaged on every machine pulse and are
self-repairing (""renewable"" spoilers). The collimation efficiency of the system
is evaluated, considering both halo particles which are rescattered into the
beam and muon secondaries which are passed to the interaction region. We
conclude that the new design is a promising candidate for the NLC post-linac
system.

down-conversion is complete, i.e. concerns both amplitude and phase. This is
realised through a homodyne detection of these images which allows for
measurement of the field quadrature components. EPR correlations are shown to
exist between symmetrical pixels of the two images. The best possible
correlation is obtained by adjusting the phase of the local oscillator field
(LO) in the area of maximal amplification. The results for quadrature
components hold unchanged even in absence of any input image i.e. for pure
parametric fluorescence. In this case they are not related to intensity and
phase fluctuations.

present in a superposition state. To achieve this, we consider the practical
problem of creating a coherent superposition state of several qubits. Owing to
considerations of quantum statistics, this requires that the entropy of the
system go down. This, in turn, has two practical implications: (i) the initial
state cannot be controlled; (ii) the temperature of the system must be reduced.
These factors, in addition to decoherence and sensitivity to errors, must be
considered in the implementation of quantum computers.

temporary assumptions. We prove that secure quantum multiparty computations are
possible if and only if classical multi party computations work. But these
strict assumptions are necessary only during the execution of the protocol and
can be loosened after termination of the protocol.
  We consider two settings:
  1. A collusion of players tries to learn the secret inputs of honest players
or tries to modify the result of the computation.
  2. A collusion of players cheats in the above way or tries to disrupt the
protocol, i.e., the collusion tries to abort the computation or leaks
information to honest players. We give bounds on the collusions tolerable after
a protocol has terminated and we state protocols reaching these bounds.

state of a quantum system. I give an overview of the main approaches to quantum
state discrimination. Several strategies exist. In quantum hypothesis testing,
a quantum system is prepared in a member of a known, finite set of states, and
the aim is to guess which one with the minimum probability of error. Error free
discrimination is also sometimes possible, if we allow for the possibility of
obtaining inconclusive results. If no prior information about the state is
provided, then it is impractical to try to determine it exactly, and it must be
estimated instead. In addition to reviewing these various strategies, I
describe connections between state discrimination, the manipulation of quantum
entanglement, and quantum cloning. Recent experimental work is also discussed.
