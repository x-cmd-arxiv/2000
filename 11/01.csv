spheroidal galaxies containing correspondingly massive black holes. [...] In
this study, we exploit the opportunity to eliminate the quasar glare by
performing sensitive spectropolarimetry with the Keck II telescope of a sample
of radio galaxies with redshifts around 2.5. [...] We show that dust-reflected
quasar light generally dominates the restframe ultraviolet continuum of these
sources and that a highly clumped scattering medium results in almost grey
scattering of the active galactic nucleus photons. The observations, however,
do not exclude a substantial star formation rate averaged over a Gyr of
evolution. The sub-mm reradiation from the scattering dust is likely to
represent only a small fraction (~10%) of the total far infrared luminosity. An
analysis of the emission lines excited in the interstellar medium of the host
galaxy by the hard quasar radiation field reveals evidence of a dramatic
chemical evolution within the spheroid during this epoch. Secondary nitrogen
production in intermediate mass stars produces a characteristic signature in
the NV/CIV and NV/HeII line ratios which has been seen previously in the broad
line region of quasars at similar redshifts. We find intriguing correlations
between the strengths of the Ly alpha and NV emission lines and the degree of
ultraviolet continuum polarization which may represent the dispersal of dust
associated with the chemical enrichment of the spheroid.

models have produced results that are in broad agreement with observations.
However, further analyses have revealed that, with progressively higher
numerical resolution, the median or cutoff line width of the simulated Lyman
alpha clouds (i.e. the Doppler parameter) appears to converge to a value
significantly below what is observed at z~3 (by about a factor of 1.5). These
convergence test simulations do not include feedback from star formation. Given
the observed metallicity in the Lyman alpha clouds we suggest that supernovae,
which presumably polluted the IGM with metals, may have deposited a sufficient
amount of energy in the IGM to reconcile the theory with observations. Simple
arguments immediately narrow the redshift range of pollution down to
4<z_{dep}<9. It seems quite certain that dwarf and sub-dwarf galaxies with
total masses in the range 10^{6.5-9.0}Msun have to be largely responsible for
the pollution. Furthermore, it is implied that either star formation is very
efficient or metal yield is very high for these early dwarf galaxies, if the
mean metallicity in the universe at z=3 is as high as <Z>=0.01Zsun. Finally,
assuming the specific supernova heating energy is proportional to the
metallicity of a gas, we note that the picture proposed here would be
consistent with supernovae being the apparently needed heating source for the
intra-cluster gas, if the required heating of the intra-cluster gas is no
greater than 1 keV per particle.

predicted by magnetic disk-locking models that seek to explain the regulation

evidence for excess mid-IR emission. While these three stars may possess
truncated disks consistent with magnetic disk-locking models, the remaining 29
stars in our sample do not. Apparently, stars lacking near-IR excesses in
general do not possess truncated disks to which they are magnetically coupled.
  We discuss the implications of this result for the hypothesis of
disk-regulated angular momentum. Evidently, young stars can exist as slow
rotators without the aid of present disk-locking, and there exist very young
stars already rotating near breakup velocity whose subsequent angular momentum
evolution will not be regulated by disks. Moreover, we question whether disks,

halos drawn from a high-resolution N-body simulation of the LCDM cosmology. We
find that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum, j, in
a halo of mass Mv is well fit by a universal function, M(<j) = Mv \mu
j/(j_0+j). This profile is defined by one shape parameter (\mu or j_0) in
addition to the global spin parameter \lambda. It follows a power-law over most
of the mass, and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced for
small values of \mu. Compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most
halos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the
distribution. The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be
cylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for ~80% of the halos. We
investigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. The first is based on a
revised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended
Press-Schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minor
mergers. Finally, we briefly explore implications of the M(<j) profile on the
formation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabatic
baryonic infall. The implied gas density profile deviates from an exponential
disk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii.
The steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that are
smaller than observed. This is reminiscent of the ""angular-momentum problem""
seen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect j
conservation. A possible solution is to associate the central excesses with
bulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks.

profiles and preliminary implications on disk formation. The specific
angular-momentum distributions within halos in N-body simulations match a
universal shape, M(<j) \propto j/(j_0+j). It is characterized by a power law
over most of the mass, and one shape parameter in addition to the spin
parameter \lambda. The angular momentum tends to be aligned throughout the halo
and of cylindrical symmetry. Even if angular momentum is conserved during
baryonic infall, the resultant disk density profile is predicted to deviate
from exponential, with a denser core and an extended tail. A slightly corrected
version of the scaling relation due to linear tidal-torque theory is used to
explain the origin of a typical power-law profile in shells, j(M) \propto M^s
with s \gsim 1. While linear theory crudely predicts the amplitudes of halo
spins, it is not a good predictor of their directions. Independently, mergers
of halos are found to produce a similar profile due to j transfer from the
orbit to the product halo via dynamical friction and tidal stripping. The halo
spin is correlated with having a recent major merger, though this correlation
is weakened by mass loss. These two effects are due to a correlation between
the spins of neighboring halos and their orbit, leading to prograde mergers.

the fundamental limit to signal detection such that the scientific feasibility

consideration of the field and moon position, it is possible to undertake `dark
time' observing programs under `bright time' conditions. Our recommendations
are particularly appropriate to all-sky survey programs.
  In certain instances, there are gains in observing efficiency with the use of
a polariser, which can significantly reduce the moonlight (or twilight)

possible in background-limited cases because the sky background can be highly
polarised, due to scattering, around ninety degrees away from the moon (or

rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set
of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or
intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key
issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context
as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon
the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the
point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means
of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The
presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high
density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are
recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating
shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and
undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The
prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a
hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is
shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.

fcc metals. Because atomistic computations of the Peierls stress take place in
finite simulation cells, image forces caused by boundaries must either be
relaxed or corrected for if system size independent results are to be obtained.
One of the approaches that has been developed for treating such boundary forces
is by computing them directly and subsequently subtracting their effects, as
developed by V. B. Shenoy and R. Phillips [Phil. Mag. A, 76 (1997) 367]. That
work was primarily analytic, and limited to screw dislocations and special

to arbitrary two-dimensional geometries, through a numerical finite element
computation. We also describe a method for estimating the boundary forces

physics, which predicts that atoms with unpaired electrons develop magnetic
moments. In a solid, the coupling between moments on nearby ions then yields
antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. The second, based on the physics
of electron fluids or 'Fermi liquids', states that Coulomb interactions can
drive the fluid to adopt a more stable configuration by developing a spin
density wave. It is presently unknown which view is appropriate at a `quantum
critical point', where the antiferromagnetic transition temperature vanishes.
Here we describe an atomically local contribution to the magnetic correlations
which develops in the metal CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_{x}$ at the critical gold
concentration ($x_c=0.1$) where the magnetic ordering temperature is tuned to
zero. This contribution implies that a Fermi-liquid destroying spin-localizing
transition, unanticipated for the spin density wave description, coincides with
the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point.

simulations to estimate the discovery reach in Run 2 for the Standard Model and
MSSM Higgs bosons. Based on a simple detector simulation, we have determined
the integrated luminosity necessary to discover the SM Higgs in the mass range
100-190 GeV. The first phase of the Run 2 Higgs search, with a total integrated
luminosity of 2 fb-1 per detector, will provide a 95% CL exclusion sensitivity
comparable to that expected at the end of the LEP2 run. With 10 fb-1 per
detector, this exclusion will extend up to Higgs masses of 180 GeV, and a
tantalizing 3 sigma effect will be visible if the Higgs mass lies below 125
GeV. With 25 fb-1 of integrated luminosity per detector, evidence for SM Higgs
production at the 3 sigma level is possible for Higgs masses up to 180 GeV.
However, the discovery reach is much less impressive for achieving a 5 sigma
Higgs boson signal. Even with 30 fb-1 per detector, only Higgs bosons with
masses up to about 130 GeV can be detected with 5 sigma significance. These
results can also be re-interpreted in the MSSM framework and yield the required
luminosities to discover at least one Higgs boson of the MSSM Higgs sector.
With 5-10 fb-1 of data per detector, it will be possible to exclude at 95% CL
nearly the entire MSSM Higgs parameter space, whereas 20-30 fb-1 is required to
obtain a 5 sigma Higgs discovery over a significant portion of the parameter
space. Moreover, in one interesting region of the MSSM parameter space (at
large tan(beta)), the associated production of a Higgs boson and a b b-bar pair
is significantly enhanced and provides potential for discovering a non-SM-like
Higgs boson in Run 2.

top-quark Yukawa coupling $f_{\rm top}$ at the unification scale $M_*\simeq

the observation of non-zero $(V_{MNS})_{e3}$, together with negative

both electric and magnetic charge, in 3+1 space-time dimensions. It has been
shown long time ago that, at the quantum mechanical level, a composite dyon
made out of a magnetic pole of charge g and a particle of electric charge e
possesses half-integral spin and fermionic statistics, if the constituents are
bosons and the Dirac quantization condition $eg=2\pi n$ holds, with n odd. This
phenomenon is called spin-statistics transmutation. We show that the same
phenomenon occurs at the quantum field theory level for an elementary dyon.
This analysis requires the construction of gauge invariant charged dyon fields.
Dirac's proposal for such fields, relying on a Coulomb-like photon cloud, leads
to quantum correlators exhibiting an unphysical dependence on the Dirac-string.
Recently Froehlich and Marchetti proposed a recipe for charged dyon fields,
based on a sum over Mandelstam-strings, which overcomes this problem. Using
this recipe we derive explicit expressions for the quantum field theory
correlators and we provide a proof of the occurrence of spin-statistics
transmutation. The proof reduces to a computation of the self-linking numbers
of dyon worldlines and Mandelstam strings, projected on a fixed time
three-space. Dyon composites are also analysed. The transmutation discussed in
this paper bares some analogy with the appearance of anomalous spin and
statistics for particles or vortices in Chern-Simons theories in 2+1
dimensions. However, peculiar features appear in 3+1 dimensions e.g. in the
spin addition rule.

Kahler metric and a closed 2-form we associate an N=2 superconformal vertex
algebra (N=2 SCVA) in the sense of our definition. We find a criterion for two
different tori to produce isomorphic N=2 SCVA's. We show that for algebraic
tori isomorphism of N=2 SCVA's implies the equivalence of the derived
categories of coherent sheaves corresponding to the tori or their
noncommutative generalizations (Azumaya algebras over tori). We also find a
criterion for two different tori to produce N=2 SCVA's related by a mirror
morphism. If the 2-form is of type (1,1), this condition is identical to the

the limit of large entropy per unit of conserved charge, is the smallness of
the isentropic speed of sound in the ``mixed phase''. A specific prediction is
that this should lead to a non-isotropic momentum distribution of nucleons in
the reaction plane (for energies around 40 AGeV in our model calculation). On
the other hand, we show that from present effective theories for low-energy QCD
one does not expect the thermal transition rate between various states of the
effective potential to be much larger than the expansion rate, questioning the
applicability of the idealized Maxwell/Gibbs construction. Experimental data
could soon provide essential information on the dynamics of the phase
transition.

developed an improved imaging method that relies on a Basis spline expansion of
the source functions with an improved implementation of constraints. We examine
under what conditions this improved method can distinguish between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian sources. Finally, we investigate pion, kaon, and proton sources
from the p-Pb reaction at 450 GeV/nucleon and from the S-Pb reaction at 200

the S-Pb correlations seem to exhibit a Gaussian core with an extended,
non-Gaussian halo. We also find evidence for a scaling of the source widths
with particle mass in the sources from the p-Pb reaction.

former case, for x=0, we have the Wigner Supermultiplet limit in which the
$2^+_1$ and $2^+_2$ states are degenerate and correspond to K=0 and K=2
rotational states, with equal and opposite static quadrupole moments. Turning
on the spin-orbit interaction with sufficient strength in the valence space
gives an energy splitting to the two $2^+$ states in accord with experiment.
When higher shell admixtures are allowed, we get quite a different behaviour as
a function of x than in the valence space. Of particular interest is a value of
x for which $Q(2^+_1)$ and $Q(2^+_2)$ both nearly vanish, and so does (somewhat
coincidentally) $\mu(2^+_1)$.

expectation $E[f(H)]$, maximised over $S$, gives the capacity of the above
channel with an input power constraint in the case $H$ is known at the receiver
but not at the transmitter. For arbitrary $C$,$D$ exact expressions are
obtained for the expectation and variance of $f(H)$ in the large matrix size
limit. For $C=D=I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix, expressions are in
addition obtained for the full moment generating function for arbitrary
(finite) matrix size in the large signal to noise limit. Finally, we obtain the
channel capacity where the channel matrix is partly known and partly unknown
and of the form $\alpha I+ \beta H$, $\alpha,\beta$ being known constants and
entries of $H$ i.i.d. Gaussian with variance $1/n$. Channels of the form

densities and seismic velocities of compositional models as functions of depth.
In order to do this it is necessary to know the volumes and thermoelastic
properties of the compositional constituents under lower mantle conditions. We
determined the thermal equation of state (EOS) of MgSiO3 perovskite using the
nonempirical variational induced breathing (VIB) interatomic potential with
molecular dynamics simulations at pressures and temperatures of the lower
mantle. We fit our pressure-volume-temperature results to a thermal EOS of the
form P(V,T) = P0(V,T0) + Delta Pth(T), where T0 = 300 K and P0 is the
isothermal Universal EOS. The thermal pressure Delta Pth can be represented by
a linear relationship Delta Pth = a + b T. We find V0 = 165.40 A^3, KT0 = 273
GPa, K'T0 = 3.86, a = -1.99 GPa, and b = 0.00664 GPa K^-1 for pressures of
0-140 GPa and temperatures of 300-3000 K. By fixing V0 to the experimentally
determined value of 162.49 A^3 and calculating density and bulk sound velocity
profiles along a lower mantle geotherm we find that the lower mantle cannot
consist solely of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite with XMg ranging from 0.9-1.0. Using
pyrolitic compositions of 67 vol % perovskite (XMg = 0.93-0.96) and 33 vol %
magnesiowustite (XMg = 0.82-0.86), however, we obtained density and velocity
profiles that are in excellent agreement with seismological models for a
reasonable geotherm.

analyze the radiation pressure by imaging the motion of the atom cloud after
the bounce. The number of photon recoils ranges from 2 to 31. This is
independent of laser power, inversely proportional to the detuning and
proportional to the evanescent-wave decay length. By operating the mirror on an
open transition, we have also observed atoms that bounce inelastically due to a
spontaneous Raman transition. The observed distributions consist of a dense
peak at the minimum velocity and a long tail of faster atoms, showing that the
transition is a stochastic process with a strong preference to occur near the
turning point of the bounce.
