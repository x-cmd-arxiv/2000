Draco stars outside of its measured tidal boundary. The search involves three
methods: 1) Plotting color-magnitude diagrams for individual fields, for
sections of fields, and for combined fields and sections. A color-magnitude
diagram can reveal a population of Draco stars by the presence of the expected
principal sequences. 2) Measuring field-to-field fluctuations and 3) measuring
intra-field fluctuations in the surface density of objects located near the
Draco principal sequences in the color-magnitude diagram. We find evidence for
the presence of Draco stars immediately beyond the measured tidal boundary of
Draco and place an upper limit on the number of such stars in more distant
fields that lie close to the extension of its major axis. The best evidence is
the presence of the Draco principal sequences in the color-magnitude diagram
for some combined fields and sections of fields. The measurements of the
field-to-field fluctuations in the stellar surface density confirm this result.

evolutionary synthesis models, to study the initial mass function (IMF) in the
mass range m > 2 Mo. For spirals (Sa-Sd), Magellanic irregulars (Im) and blue
compact dwarfs (BCD), our determination is consistent with a Salpeter IMF with
an upper mass cutoff M_up = 80 Mo. The history of star formation and the amount
of total gas (per unit mass) of galaxies are found to depend primarily on their
total masses (as traced by the H band luminosities) and only secondarily on
morphological type. The present star formation activity of massive spirals is
up to 100 times smaller than that average over their lifetime, while in low
mass galaxies it is comparable to or higher than that at earlier epochs. Dwarf
galaxies have presently larger gas reservoirs per unit mass than massive
spirals. The efficiency in transforming gas into stars and the time scale for
gas depletion (10 Gyrs) are independent of the luminosity and/or of the
morphological type. These evidences are consistent with the idea that galaxies
are coeval systems,that they evolved as closed-boxes forming stars following a
simple, universal star formation law whose characteristic time scale is small
(1 Gyr) in massive spirals and large (10 Gyr) in low mass galaxies. A similar
conclusion was drawn by Gavazzi and Scodeggio (1996) to explain the
colour-magnitude relation of late-type galaxies. The consequences of this
interpretation on the evolution of the star formation rate and of the gas

put the models into context with the empirical brightness decline relation

scales. This relation can be well understood in the framework of M(Ch)-WDs as a
consequence of the opacity effects in combination with the amount of 56Ni which
determines the brightness. We show that evolution may produce an offset in the

curves; the central emission indicates recent gas infall after a close
galaxy-galaxy pass. These four galaxies may be local counterparts to compact,
blue galaxies at intermediate redshift. The remaining galaxies have a
negligible offset from the reference Tully-Fisher relation, but a shallower
slope (2.6-sigma significance) and a 25% larger scatter. We characterize the
non-outlier sample with measures of distortion and star formation to search for
third parameter dependence in the residuals of the TF relation. Severe
kinematic distortion is the only significant predictor of TF residuals; this
distortion is not, however, responsible for the slope difference from the

massive stars during which the central region collapses, forms a neutron star
(NS), and the outer layers are ejected. Recent explosion scenarios assumed that
the ejection is due to energy deposition by neutrinos into the envelope but
detailed models do not produce powerful explosions. There is mounting evidence
for an asphericity in the SN which is difficult to explain within this picture.
This evidence includes the observed high polarization, pulsar kicks, high
velocity iron-group and intermediate-mass elements material observed in
remnants, etc.
  The discovery of highly magnetars revived the idea that the basic mechanism
for the ejection of the envelope is related to a highly focused MHD-jet formed
at the NS. Our 3-D hydro simulations of the jet propagation through the star
confirmed that the mechanism can explain the asphericities.

mode, a CDM isocurvature mode, a neutrino density isocurvature mode, and a
neutrino velocity isocurvature mode. The most general perturbation is described
by a 5x5, positive-definite, symmetric, matrix-valued function of wave number

nitrogen lines are especially strong, and indicate that the shocked gas in the

atmosphere of this star from ultraviolet spectra. We find that the forbidden to

on the structure of the GRB optical afterglow. In this paper, we use these
structural parameters to calculate the probability of such a microlensing event
in a realistic scenario, where all compact objects in the universe are
associated with observable galaxies. For GRB000301C at a redshift of z=2.04,
the `a posteriori' probability for a microlensing event with an amplitude of
dm>=0.95 mag (as observed) is 0.7% (2.7%) for the most plausible scenario of a
flat Lambda-dominated FRW universe with Omega_m=0.3 and a fraction f_*=0.2
(1.0) of dark-matter in the form of compact objects. If we lower the
magnification threshold to dm>=0.10 mag, the probabilities for microlensing
events of GRB afterglows increase to 17% (57%). We emphasise that this low
probability for a microlensing signature of almost a magnitude does not exclude
that the observed event in the afterglow lightcurve of GRB000301C was caused by
microlensing, especially in light of the fact that a galaxy was found within 2
arcsec from the GRB. In that case, however, a more robust upper limit on the `a
posteriori' probability of ~5% is found. It does show, however, that it will
not be easy to create a large sample of strong GRB afterglow microlensing
events for statistical studies of their physical conditions on micro-arcsec

AALs have ionizations ranging from Mg I to N V, and multi-component profiles
that are blueshifted by ~400 to ~1400 km/s relative to the quasar's broad
emission lines. These data yield the following new results. 1) The density
based on Si II*/Si II lines is ~300 cm-3, implying a distance of ~28 kpc from
the quasar if the gas is photoionized. 2) The characteristic flow time is thus

region, compared to ~15 cm-3 where the N V lines form. 4) The total column
density is N_H < 4 x 10^18 cm-2 in the neutral gas and N_H ~ 2 x 10^20 cm-2 in
the moderately ionized regions. 5) The total mass in the AAL outflow is M ~ 2 x
10^9 Mo, assuming a global covering factor (as viewed from the quasar) of ~10%
>. 6) The absorbing gas only partially covers the background light source(s)
along our line(s) of sight, requiring absorption in small clouds or filaments
<0.01 pc across. The ratio N_H/n_H implies that the clouds have radial (line-
of-sight) thicknesses <0.2 pc. These properties might characterize a sub-class
of AALs that are physically related to quasars but form at large distances. We
propose a model for the absorber in which pockets of dense neutral gas are
surrounded by larger clouds of generally lower density and higher ionization.
This outflowing material might be leftover from a blowout associated with a

radio galaxies embedded in the intracluster medium (ICM) of a galaxy cluster.
We distinguish three regimes. In the early life of a powerful source, the
entire radio cocoon is expanding supersonically and hence drives a strong shock
into the ICM. Eventually, the sides of the cocoon become subsonic and the ICM
is disturbed by the sonic booms of the jet's working surface. In both of these
regimes, X-ray observations would find an X-ray shell. In the strong shock
regime, this shell will be hot and relatively thin. However, in the weak shock
(sonic-boom) regime, the shell will be approximately the same temperature as
the undisturbed ICM. If a cooling flow is present, the observed shell may even
be cooler than the undisturbed ICM due to the lifting of cooler material into
the shell from the inner (cooler) regions of the cluster. In the third and
final regime, the cocoon has collapsed and no well-defined X-ray shell will be
seen. We discuss ways of estimating the power and age of the source once its
regime of behavior has been determined.

gas rich, rotationally supported dIrrs, mostly found at the outskirts of the
Local Group (LG), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)
or dwarf ellipticals (dEs), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.
The initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive dark
matter halos and reproduce nearby dIrrs. Repeated tidal shocks at the
pericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and trigger
dynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.
After only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (LSB) dIrrs are transformed into
dSphs, while high surface brightness (HSB) dIrrs evolve into dEs. This
evolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relation
observed for LG dwarfs. Dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, like
the archetypical dIrr GR8, are turned into Draco or Ursa Minor, the faintest
and most dark matter dominated among LG dSphs. If disks include a gaseous
component, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts of
star formation. The resulting star formation histories are in good qualitative
agreement with those derived using HST color-magnitude diagrams for local
dSphs.

accurate luminosity functions to compare with their Galactic counterparts,
determine metallicities from the slope of the giant branch, identify long
period variables, and estimate ages from the AGB tip luminosity, we must be
able to disentangle the true properties of the population from the
observational effects associated with measurements made in very crowded fields.
  In this paper we present a careful analysis of photometry in crowded regions,
and show how image blending affects the results and interpretation of such
data. Although this analysis is specifically for our NICMOS observations in
M31, the techniques we develop can be applied to any imaging data taken in
crowded fields; we show how the effects of image blending will even limit NGST.
We use three different techniques to analyze the effects of crowding on our
data, including the insertion of artificial stars (traditional completeness
tests) and the creation of completely artificial clusters. They are used to
derive threshold- and critical-blending radii for each cluster, which determine
how close to the cluster center reliable photometry can be achieved. The
simulations also allow us to quantify and correct for the effects of blending
on the slope and width of the RGB at different surface brightness levels.

slopes of their infrared giant branches we estimate [Fe/H]=-1.22+/-0.43 for G1

epochs of optical HST-WFPC2 V-band data and identify at least one LPV based on
color and variability. The location of G1's giant branch in the K-(V-K) CMD is
very similar to that of M107, indicating a higher metallicity than our purely
infrared CMD: [Fe/H]=-0.9+/-0.2.
  For the field surrounding G280, we estimate the metallicity to be -1.3 with a
spread of 0.5 from the slope and width of the giant branch. Based on the
numbers and luminosities of the brightest giants, we conclude that only a small
fraction of the stars in this field could be as young as 2 Gyr, while the
majority have ages closer to 10 Gyr.
  The K-band luminosity functions (LFs) of the upper few magnitudes of G1 and
G280, as well as for the fields surrounding all clusters, are indistinguishable
from the LF measured in the bulge of our Galaxy. This indicates that these
clusters are very similar to Galactic clusters, and at least in the surrounding

actually played by the high production of Pb in low-mass and low-metallicity

  astron.sty",,,"MPA 1317E","astro-ph",,"  The strong activity of radio galaxies should have led to a nearly ubiquitous
presence of fossil radio plasma in the denser regions of the inter-galactic
medium as clusters, groups and filaments of galaxies. This fossil radio plasma
can contain large quantities of relativistic particles (electrons and possibly
protons) by magnetic confinement. These particles might be released and/or
re-energized under environmental influences as turbulence and shock waves.
Possible connections of such processes to the formation of the observed sources
of diffuse radio emission in clusters of galaxies (the cluster radio halos and
the cluster radio relics) are discussed.

stars may have only recently evolved into contact. The binary has an unusually
high mass ratio (0.84), and a relatively long orbital period (0.506 d) for it
spectral type (mid-G). Twelve ultraviolet spectra of OO Aql were obtained in
1988 with the IUE satellite, including a series of consecutive observations
that cover nearly a complete orbital cycle. Chromospheric activity is studied
by means of the Mg II h+k emission at 2800 A. The Mg II emission is found to
vary, even when the emission is normalized to the adjacent continuum flux. This
variation may be correlated with orbital phase in the 1988 observations. It
also appears that the normalized Mg II emission varies with time, as seen in
spectra obtained at two different epochs in 1988 and when compared with two
spectra obtained several years earlier. The level of chromospheric activity in
OO Aql is less than that of other W UMa-type binaries of similar colors, but
this is attributed to its early stage of contact binary evolution. Ultraviolet
light curves were composed from measurements of the ultraviolet continuum in
the spectra. These were analyzed along with visible light curves of OO Aql to
determine the system parameters. The large wavelength range in the light curves
enabled a well-constrained fit to a cool spot in the system.

correspoding to each energy eigenvalue, we find that these timescales may vary
by many orders of magnitude depending on dimension. For example, the time taken

This decrease of the bubble wall velocity affects the result of electroweak

$\sim 10^{-2}$, the resulting baryon asymmetry can either be enhanced or
suppressed, depending on the initial value of the wall velocity. We calculate
the evolution of the phase transition taking into account the release of latent

this effect, in the MSSM it causes a suppression to the final baryon asymmetry.

arising from wrapping N D6-branes on the K3 manifold in Type IIA string theory

2+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with eight supercharges. The main results
uncovered by this exploration are: a) better insight into the non-perturbative

its characterisation in terms of generalisations of an Atiyah-Hitchin-like
manifold; c) the use of Nahm data to describe aspects of the geometry, showing
that the enhancon locus itself has a description as a fuzzy sphere. Part two
discusses the addition of extra D2-branes into the geometry. Two probe

canonical Darboux bases is proposed for the non-relativistic N-body problem by
exploiting a geometrical and group theoretical approach to the definition of
{\it body frame} for deformable bodies. This basis is adapted to the rotation
group SO(3), whose canonical realization is associated with a symmetry
Hamiltonian {\it left action}. The analysis of the SO(3) coadjoint orbits
contained in the N-body phase space implies the existence of a {\it spin frame}
for the N-body system. Then, the existence of appropriate non-symmetry
Hamiltonian {\it right actions} for non-rigid systems leads to the construction
of a N-dependent discrete number of {\it dynamical body frames} for the N-body
system, hence to the associated notions of {\it dynamical} and {\it measurable}
orientation and shape variables, angular velocity, rotational and vibrational
configurations. For N=3 the dynamical body frame turns out to be unique and our
approach reproduces the {\it xxzz gauge} of the gauge theory associated with
the {\it orientation-shape} SO(3) principal bundle approach of Littlejohn and
Reinsch. For $N \geq 4$ our description is different, since the dynamical body
frames turn out to be {\it momentum dependent}. The resulting Darboux bases for
$N\geq 4$ are connected to the coupling of the {\it spins} of particle clusters
rather than the coupling of the {\it centers of mass} (based on Jacobi relative
normal coordinates). One of the advantages of the spin coupling is that, unlike
the center-of-mass coupling, it admits a relativistic generalization.

laser is revisited. Starting from the Scully-Lamb master equation, we present a
fully analytical treatment to determine the correlation function and the
spectrum of the cavity field at steady state. For this purpose, we develop an
analytical approximation method that implicitly incorporates the microscopic
fluctuations of both the phase and intensity of the field, and, in addition,
takes full account of the saturation of the nonlinear gain. Our main result is
a simple formula for the quantum-limited linewidth that is valid from near to
far above threshold and also includes the presence of thermal photons. Close to
the threshold, the linewidth is twice as large as predicted by the standard
phase-diffusion treatment neglecting intensity fluctuations, and even 50% above
threshold the increase is still considerable. In general, quantum fluctuations
of the intensity are present and continue to influence the linewidth as long as
the photon-number distribution is not strictly Poissonian. This inherent
relationship is displayed by a formula relating the linewidth and the Mandel
Q-parameter. More than 100% above treshold the linewidth is found to be smaller
than predicted by the standard treatment, since the simple phase-diffusion
model increasingly overestimates the rate of phase fluctuations by neglecting
gain saturation. In the limit of a very large mean photon number the expected
perfectly coherent classical field is obtained.

the non-renormalization theorem. An N-fold supersymmetry was earlier found for
