developed recently by Malkov (1998, Phys. Rev. E 58, 4911). By adopting this
analytic solution, a numerical treatment of the plasma-physical injection model
at a strong quasi-parallel shock has been devised and incorporated into the
combined gas dynamics and the CR diffusion-convection code. In order to
investigate self-consistently the injection and acceleration efficiencies, we
have applied this code to the CR modified shocks of both high and low Mach
numbers (M=30 and M=2.24) with a Bohm type diffusion model. We find the
injection process is self-regulated in such a way that the injection rate
reaches and stays at a nearly stable value after quick initial adjustment. For
both shocks about 0.1% of the incoming thermal particles are injected into the
CRs. For the weak shock, the shock has reached a steady state within our
integration time and about 10% of the total available shock energy is
transfered into the CR energy density. The strong shock has achieved a higher
acceleration efficiency of about 20% by the end of our simulation, but has not
yet reached a steady-state.

(ii) a ring-like system with a ~6"" inner radius detected only in H2, likely the

core neutron superfluid does not participate in the free precession of the
crust. We apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of free
precession that have appeared in the literature. Assuming crust-only
precession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent with
there not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; the maximum amount of
pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the total
stellar moment of inertia. However, the observations do not rule out the
possibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a single
unit. In this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the
observations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia. Both of
these values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predicted
by many theories of pulsar glitches. We conclude that superfluid pinning, at
least as it affects free precession, needs to be reconsidered.

  We introduce statistical models of the FP and relative fitting methods: the
MIST (Measurement errors and Intrinsic Scatter Three dimensional) fits. The
MIST fits account for the measurement errors on the variables and their
correlations as well as for the intrinsic scatter. We show that the lack of a
model of the intrinsic scatter of the FP is the origin of the systematic
differences between the various fitting methods.
  We also address the problem of estimating the uncertainties of the FP
coefficients and determine a simple relation between the sample size and the
expected accuracy of the coefficients.
  The present study leads to define a `minimum sample size' for a correct
estimate of the uncertainties. For N < 30, both theoretical formulae and
re-sampling techniques, like the bootstrap, do not give reliable estimates.
  The question of the 'universality' of the FP is addressed by applying the
MIST fits to ten samples of cluster galaxies. The FP slopes are actually
consistent between the different samples, but, due to the large uncertainties,
they could also hide significant systematic differences.
  The feasibility of the measurement of the possible variations of the FP
slopes as a function of redshift is also proved.

  millimeter surveys', eds. J. Lowenthal and D. Hughes, World Scientific",,"10.1142/9789812811738_0002",,"astro-ph",,"  There is growing evidence that, at the S(850) < 1 mJy level, the sub-mm
galaxy population (and hence a potentially significant fraction of the sub-mm
background) is associated with the star-forming Lyman-break population already
detected at optical wavelengths. However, the implied star-formation rates in
such objects (typically 3-30 solar masses per year) fall one or two orders of
magnitude short of the level of star-forming activity required to produce the
most massive elliptical galaxies on a timescale ~ 1 Gyr. If a significant
fraction of massive ellipticals did form the bulk of their stars in short-lived
massive starbursts at high redshift, then they should presumably be found among
the brighter, S(850) ~ 10 mJy sub-mm sources which are undoubtedly not part of
the Lyman-break population. A first powerful clue that this is indeed the case
comes from our major SCUBA survey of radio galaxies, which indicates that
massive dust-enshrouded star-formation in at least this subset of massive
ellipticals is largely confined to z > 2.5, with a mean redshift z = 3.5. While
radio selection raises concerns about bias, I argue that our current knowledge
of the brightest (S(850) ~ 10 mJy) sub-mm sources detected in unbiased SCUBA
imaging surveys indicates that they are also largely confined to this same
high-z regime. Consequently, while the most recent number counts imply such
extreme sources can contribute only 5-10% of the sub-mm background, their
comoving number density (in the redshift band 3 < z < 5) is 1-2 x 10^{-5} per
cubic megaparsec, sufficient to account for the formation of all ellipticals of
comparable mass to radio galaxies (~4L-star) in the present-day universe.

simultaneous moderate starbursts in gas-rich disk galaxies in clusters which

helical turbulence with strong imposed shear. After some initial exponential
growth, the magnetic field develops a large scale travelling wave pattern. The
resulting field structure possesses magnetic helicity, which is conserved in a
periodic box by the ideal MHD equations and can hence only change on a
resistive time scale. This constrains strongly the growth time of the large
scale magnetic field, but less strongly the length of the cycle period.
Comparing with the case without shear, the time scale for large scale field
amplification is shortened by a factor Q, which depends on the relative
importance of shear and helical turbulence, and which controls also the ratio
of toroidal to poloidal field. The results of the simulations can be reproduced
qualitatively and quantitatively with a mean-field alpha-Omega dynamo model
with alpha-effect and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity coefficients that are
less strongly quenched than in the corresponding alpha^2-dynamo.

their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with models which constrain their

we find that almost all of them lie in the redshift range 1<z<2. We also
present near-infrared spectroscopy of these galaxies which demonstrate that
their SEDs are not dominated by emission lines, although tentative lines,
consistent with H-alpha at z=1.45 and z=1.61, are found in two objects.
Although the red colours of the 7CRS galaxies can formally be explained by
stellar populations which are either very old or young and heavily reddened,
independent evidence favours the former hypothesis. At z~1.5 at least 1/4 of
powerful radio jets are triggered in massive (>L*) galaxies which formed the
bulk of their stars several Gyr earlier, that is at epochs corresponding to
redshifts z>5. If a similar fraction of all z~1.5 radio galaxies are old, then
extrapolation of the radio luminosity function shows that, depending on the
radio source lifetimes, between 10-100% of the near-IR selected extremely red
object (ERO) population undergo a radio outburst at epochs corresponding to
1<z<2. An ERO found serendipitously in the field of one of the 7CRS radio
sources appears to be a radio-quiet analogue of the 7CRS EROs with an emission
line likely to be [OII] at z=1.20. The implication is that some of the most
massive elliptical galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at z>5 and these
objects probably undergo at least two periods of AGN activity: one at high
redshift during which the black hole forms and another one at an epoch
corresponding to z~1.5.

hexagonal unit cell of the triangular flux-line lattice is replaced by a circle
of the same area, and the periodic solutions to the Ginzburg-Landau equations
within this cell are approximated by rotationally symmetric solutions. The
Ginzburg-Landau equations are solved by a trial function for the order
parameter. The calculated spatial distributions of the order parameter and the
magnetic field are compared with the corresponding distributions obtained by
numerical solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The comparison reveals
good agreement with an accuracy of a few percent for all $\kappa$ values
exceeding $\kappa \approx 1$. The model can be extended to anisotropic
superconductors when the vortices are directed along one of the principal axes.
The reversible magnetization curve is calculated and an analytical formula for
the magnetization is proposed. At low fields, the theory reduces to the London
approach at $\kappa \gg 1$, provided that the exact value of $H_{c1}$ is used.
At high fields, our model reproduces the main features of the well-known
Abrikosov theory. The magnetic field dependences of the reversible
magnetization found numerically and by our variational method practically
coincide. The model also refines the limits of some approximations which have
been widely used. The calculated magnetization curves are in a good agreement
with experimental data on high-T$_c$ superconductors.

provided that there is always a reference frame, which may differ with location
and time, where the matter tensor can be reduced to a mass density with the
other elements zero. We call such matter tensors simple. This restriction means
that the tensor can be put into one to one correspondence with the Dirac

isomorphic to QED, provided that the temporal and a spatial co-ordinate are

Gaussian sum-rules have the advantage of being able to probe excited and ground
states with similar sensitivity. Gaussian sum-rule analysis techniques are
applied to the problematic scalar glueball channel to determine masses, widths
and relative resonance strengths of low-lying scalar glueball states
contributing to the hadronic spectral function. A feature of our analysis is
the inclusion of instanton contributions to the scalar gluonic correlation
function. Compared with the next-to-leading Gaussian sum-rule, the analysis of
the lowest-weighted sum-rule (which contains a large scale-independent
contribution from the low energy theorem) is shown to be unreliable because of
instability under QCD uncertainties. However, the presence of instanton effects
leads to approximately consistent mass scales in the lowest weighted and
next-lowest weighted sum-rules. The analysis of the next-to-leading sum-rule
demonstrates that a single narrow resonance model does not provide an adequate
description of the hadronic spectral function. Consequently, we consider a wide
variety of phenomenological models which distribute resonance strength over a
broad region---some of which lead to excellent agreement between the
theoretical prediction and phenomenological models. Including QCD
uncertainties, our results indicate that the hadronic contributions to the
spectral function stem from a pair of resonances with masses in the range
0.8--1.6 GeV, with the lighter of the two potentially having a large width.

the ambient projective space. More precisely, assume V is arithmetically
Cohen-Macaulay, for instance, a complete intersection. Assume as well that V
projects to a normal-crossings hypersurface, which is the case when V is a
curve with at most ordinary nodes. Then we show that r<m+s+2, where s is the
dimension of V and m is the degree of the vector field. Our method consists of
using first central projections to reduce the problem to when V is a
hypersurface, and then bounds given by Brunella and Mendes.

dynamics of diffusively coupled one and two dimensional cellular nonlinear
networks (CNNs), involving Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua circuit as the basic element,
is considered. Propagation failure in the case of uniform diffusion and
propagation blocking in the case of defects are pointed out. The mechanism
behind these phenomena in terms of loss of stability is explained. Various
spatiotemporal patterns arising from diffusion driven instability such as
hexagons, rhombous and rolls are considered when external forces are absent.
Existence of penta-hepta defects and removal of them due to external forcing is
discussed. The transition from hexagonal to roll structure and breathing
oscillations in the presence of external forcing is also demonstrated. Further
spatiotemporal chaos, synchronization and size instability in the coupled
