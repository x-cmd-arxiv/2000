  10-15 2000",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we review the main and the most recent evidence for the
presence of a core radius in the distribution of the dark matter around spiral
galaxies. Their rotation curves, coadded according to the galaxy luminosity,
conform to an Universal profile which can be represented as the sum of an
exponential thin disk term plus a spherical halo term with a flat density core.
  From dwarfs to giants, these halos feature a constant density region of size
r_0 and core density rho_0 related by rho_0= 4.5 10^{-2} (r_0/kpc)^{-2/3}M_sol
pc^{-3}. At the highest masses rho_0 decreases exponentially, with r_0
revealing a lack of objects with disk masses > 10^{11}M_sol and central
densities > 1.5 10^{-2}(r_0/kpc)^{-3} M_sol pc^{-3}, which implies a maximum
mass of ~2 10^{12} M_sol for halos hosting spirals. The fine structure of dark
matter halos is obtained from the kinematics of a number of suitable
low-luminosity disk galaxies. The inferred halo circular velocity increases
linearly with radius out to the edge of the stellar disk, implying a constant
dark halo density over the entire disk region. The structural properties of
halos around normal spirals are similar to those around dwarf and low surface
brightness galaxies; nevertheless they provide far more substantial evidence of
the discrepancy between the mass distributions predicted in the Cold Dark
Matter scenario and those actually detected around galaxies.

in the redshift-color diagram, consistent with predictions of spectral
synthesis models in which the dominant stellar population is formed at
redshifts z > 1.5. Constructing a luminosity function of the full sample of
  145 E/S0s, we find that there is about 1.1--1.9 magnitude brightening in
rest-frame B band luminosity back to z = 0.8 from z=0, consistent with other
studies.
  Together with the red colors, this brightening favors models in which the
bulk of stars in red field E/S0s formed before z_{for} > 1.5 and have been
evolving rather quiescently with few large starbursts since then.
  Evolution in the number density of field E/S0 galaxies is harder to measure,
and uncertainties in the raw counts and their ratio to local samples might
amount to as much as a factor of two.
  Within that uncertainty, the number density of red E/S0s to z = 0.8 seems
relatively static, being comparable to or perhaps moderately less than that of
local E/S0s depending on the assumed cosmology. A doubling of E/S0 number
density since z = 1 can be ruled out with high confidence (97%) if
\Omega_{m}=1.
  Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the
majority of luminous field E/S0s were already in place by z = 1, that the bulk
of their stars were already fairly old, and that their number density has not
changed by large amounts since then.

starburst in the central region of this galaxy. Supporting evidence for a
superbubble model is; 1) the poststarburst nature in the central body suggests
that a burst of supernova explosions could occur at least $\sim 10^7$ yr ago,
2) the dark lane seen in the central body suggests that we observe this object
from a nearly edge-on view, and, 3) the ring-like morphology is not
inconsistent with an idea that it is a pair of superbubbles. All these pieces

  Supported Accretion Disks","30 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/320968",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a general linear dispersion relation which describes the coupled
behavior of magnetorotational, photon bubble, and convective instabilities in
weakly magnetized, differentially rotating accretion disks. We presume the
accretion disks to be geometrically thin and supported vertically by radiation
pressure. We fully incorporate the effects of a nonzero radiative diffusion
length on the linear modes. In an equilibrium with purely vertical magnetic
field, the vertical magnetorotational modes are completely unaffected by
compressibility, stratification, and radiative diffusion. However, in the
presence of azimuthal fields, which are expected in differentially rotating
flows, the growth rate of all magnetorotational modes can be reduced
substantially below the orbital frequency. This occurs if diffusion destroys
radiation sound waves on the length scale of the instability, and the magnetic
energy density of the azimuthal component exceeds the non-radiative thermal
energy density. While sluggish in this case, the magnetorotational instability
still persists and will still tap the free energy of the differential rotation.
Photon bubble instabilities are generically present in radiation pressure
dominated flows where diffusion is present. We show that their growth rates are
limited to a maximum value which is reached at short wavelengths where the
modes may be viewed as unstable slow magnetosonic waves. We also find that
vertical radiation pressure destabilizes upward propagating fast waves, and
that Alfv\'en waves can be unstable. These instabilities typically have smaller
growth rates than the photon bubble/slow modes. We discuss how all these modes
behave in various regimes of interest, and speculate how they may affect the
dynamics of real accretion disk flows.

We detected three regions of molecular emission in the north-west (NW),
south-east (SE) and centre of NGC 4214 which are in very different and distinct
evolutionary stages (total molecular mass: 5.1 x 10^6 M_sun). These differences
are apparent most dramatically when the CO morphologies are compared to optical
ground based and HST imaging: massive star formation has not started yet in the
NW region; the well-known starburst in the centre is the most evolved and star
formation in the SE complex started more recently. We derive a star formation
efficiency of 8% for the SE complex. Using high--resolution VLA observations of
neutral hydrogen HI and our CO data we generated a total gas column density map
for NGC 4214 (HI + H_2). No clear correlation is seen between the peaks of HI,

modulations at both P_X and P_opt are present in the optical data, with the

also attempted to determine the ``beat'' period, as seen in the repeating

primary drivers of evolution in M94 at the present epoch. Similar processes may

types can be easily detected from observations by using not only the Space

the ground-based interferometers (with a threshold ~30 \mu-as). However,
detection of $\vDelta\vdelta\vtheta_c$ from ground-based observations will be
difficult for nearly all Galactic bulge self-lensing events, and will be
restricted only for small fractions of disk-bulge and halo-LMC events, for

both spins and couplings are frozen. A detailed stability analysis leads also

shown that two types of glass, an attractive and a repulsive one, are predicted
by MCT for this model. The former can form at quite low densities. Most of our
attention is directed at the mechanical properties of the glasses predicted by
this theory. In particular we calculate the elastic shear modulus at zero
frequency and the longitudinal stress modulus in the long wavelength limit.

$\eta_s^{sun}$ which quantify an involvement of the sterile component in the
solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The (2+2)-scheme predicts
$\eta_s^{atm} + \eta_s^{sun} = 1$ and the experimental proof of deviation from
this equality will discriminate the scheme. In this connection the (3+1)-scheme
is revisited in which the fourth (predominantly sterile) neutrino is isolated
from a block of three flavour neutrinos by the mass gap $\Delta m^2_{LSND} \sim
(0.4-10)$ eV$^2$. We find that in the (3+1)-scheme the LSND result can be
reconciled with existing bounds on $\nu_e$- and $\nu_{\mu}$ - disappearance at
95-99 % C.L.. The generic prediction of the scheme is the $\nu_e$- and
$\nu_{\mu}$ - disappearance probabilities at the level of present experimental
bounds. The possibility to strengthen the bound on $\nu_{\mu}$- disappearance
in the KEK - front detector experiment is studied. We consider phenomenology of
the (3 + 1)-scheme, in particular, its implications for the atmospheric
neutrinos, neutrinoless double beta decay searches, supernova neutrinos and
primordial nucleosynthesis.

\partial^{\mu}H_1-H_1 \partial^{\mu} H_2 (suppressed by \Delta\beta), the

the charged Higgs mass and moderate values of \tan\beta the contribution to the
source proportional to H_2 \partial^{\mu}H_1+H_1 \partial^{\mu} H_2 in the

acceptable values of the baryon asymmetry for values of the CP-violating phases

a definite value of momentum there. The convergence of Rabi-floppings in atomic
wave-packet-states is a direct consequence of Doppler effect on optical
transition rates (Rabi-frequencies): it gradually leads to ''irregular''
chaotic-type distributions of momentum in ground and excited energy levels,
smearing the amplitudes of Rabi-floppings. Conjointly with Rabi-floppings, the
coherent accumulation of momentum on each internal energy level monotonically
diminishes too.
