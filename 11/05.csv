model of light nuclei. In this model a possible clue to the solution of the
SNP's is in the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes relative to the
predicted by the Standard Solar Model through the decrease of the solar core
temperature. The former can be realized through the enhancement of the
astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning. The enhancement the upper
bound of which is restricted by the helioseismological data goes dynamically
via the contribution of the nucleon tensor current coupled to the deuteron. The
agreement of the reduced solar neutrino fluxes with the experimental data can
be reached within a scenario of vacuum two-flavour neutrino oscillations
without a fine tuning of the neutrino-flavour oscillation parameters. In the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model of light nuclei an enhancement of the astrophysical
factor for the solar proton burning entails a change of the cross sections for
neutrino and anti-neutrino disintegration of the deuteron at low energies. This
provides a theoretical foundation for a new check of a value of the
astrophysical factor in terrestrial laboratories.

optical spectra in astronomical observations with extremely accurate
subtraction of night sky emission. The observing technique requires that the
telescope is nodded rapidly between targets and adjacent sky positions; object
and sky spectra are recorded on adjacent regions of a low-noise CCD through
charge shuffling. This permits the use of extremely high densities of small
slit apertures (`microslits') since an extended slit is not required for sky
interpolation. The overall multi-object advantage of this technique is as large
as 2.9x that of conventional multi-slit observing for an instrument
configuration which has an underfilled CCD detector and is always >1.5 for high
target densities. The `nod-shuffle' technique has been practically implemented
at the Anglo-Australian Telescope as the `LDSS++ project' and achieves
sky-subtraction accuracies as good as 0.04%, with even better performance
possible. This is a factor of ten better than is routinely achieved with
long-slits. LDSS++ has been used in various observational modes, which we
describe, and for a wide variety of astronomical projects. The nod-shuffle
approach should be of great benefit to most spectroscopic (e.g. long-slit,
fiber, integral field) methods and would allow much deeper spectroscopy on very
large telescopes (10m or greater) than is currently possible. Finally we
discuss the prospects of using nod-shuffle to pursue extremely long
spectroscopic exposures (many days) and of mimicking nod-shuffle observations
with infrared arrays.

diagnostic for the ionization mechanism and physical properties of
emission-line regions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is known
that simple photoionization models underpredict the [O III]4363 intensity,
being inconsistent with observations. In this paper, we report on several
pieces of evidence that a large fraction of the [O III]4363 emission arises
from the dense gas obscured by putative tori: (1) the visibility of high-R_OIII
regions is correlated to that of broad-line regions, (2) higher-R_OIII objects
show hotter mid-infrared colors, (3) higher-R_OIII objects show stronger
highly-ionized emission lines such as [Fe VII]6087 and [Fe X]6374, and (4)
higher-R_OIII objects have broader line width of [O III]4363 normalized by that
of [O III]5007. To estimate how such a dense component contributes to the total
emission-line flux, dual-component photoionization model calculations are
performed. It is shown that the observed values of R_OIII of type 1 AGNs may be
explained by introducing a 5% - 20% contribution from the dense component while
those of type 2 AGNs may be explained by introducing a 0% - 2% contribution. We
also discuss the [O III]4363 emitting regions in LINERs in the framework of our

turbulent MHD flows in ``1+2/3'' dimensions by means of its effect on the
probability density function (PDF) of the density field. We start by reviewing
our previous results for general polytropic flows, according to which the value
of the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ determines the functional shape of the PDF.
A lognormal density PDF appears in the isothermal ($\gamma=1$) case, but a
power-law tail at either large or small densities appears for large Mach
numbers when $\gamma >1$ and $\gamma < 1$, respectively. In the isothermal
magnetic case, the relevant parameter is the field fluctuation amplitude,
$\dbb$. A lognormal PDF still appears for small field fluctuations (generally
the case for {\it large mean fields}), but a significant low-density excess
appears at large fluctuation amplitudes ({\it weak mean fields}), similar to
the behavior at $\gamma > 1$ of polytropic flows. We interpret these results in
terms of simple nonlinear MHD waves, for which the magnetic pressure behaves
linearly with the density in the case of the slow mode, and quadratically in
the case of the fast wave. Finally, we discuss some implications of these
results, in particular the fact that the effect of the magnetic field in
modifying the PDF is strongest when the mean field is weak.

associated with flux variations at the level of percents, are observed at a

increases with energy, the newly discovered QPOs are limited to the softest

the nematic director in the bulk. itself is affected by the flow. The

ceases, circular domains of homeotropic orientation nucleate in the sample and
expand until the whole sample becomes homeotropic. This relaxation process from

are re-interpreted as tangles of graphical calculus. Regularization due to the
design of convolution Hopf gebras is given as a program for further research.

  to typeset (in Unix)",,,,"math.DG math.MG math.SP",,"  The first isospectral pairs of metrics are constructed on balls and spheres.
This long standing problem, concerning the existence of such pairs, has been
solved by a new method called ""Anticommutator Technique."" Among the wide range
of such pairs, the most striking examples are provided on (4k-1)-dimensional
spheres, where k > 2. One of these metrics is homogeneous (since it is the
metric on the geodesic sphere of a 2-point homogeneous space), while the other
is locally inhomogeneous. These examples demonstrate the surprising fact that
no information about the isometries is encoded in the spectrum of Laplacian
acting on functions. In other words, ""The group of isometries, even the local
homogeneity property, is lost to the ""Non-Audible"" in the debate of ""Audible
versus Non-Audible Geometry"".""

"math/0011034","Zoltan I. Szabo","Z. I. Szabo","A cornucopia of isospectral pairs of metrics on spheres with different
  local geometries","The paper has been completely revised. Accepted for publication in
  Annals of Mathematics",,,,"math.DG math.MG math.SP",,"  This article concludes the comprehensive study started in [Sz5], where the
first non-trivial isospectral pairs of metrics are constructed on balls and
spheres. These investigations incorporate 4 different cases since these balls
and spheres are considered both on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups and on their
solvable extensions. In [Sz5] the considerations are completely concluded in
the ball-case and in the nilpotent-case. The other cases were mostly outlined.
In this paper the isospectrality theorems are completely established on
spheres. Also the important details required about the solvable extensions are
concluded in this paper.
  A new so called anticommutator technique is developed for these
constructions. This tool is completely different from the other methods applied
in the field so far. It brought a wide range of new isospectrality examples.
Those constructed on geodesic spheres of certain harmonic manifolds are
particularly striking. One of these spheres is homogeneous (since it is the
geodesic sphere of a 2-point homogeneous space) while the other spheres,
although isospectral to the previous one, are not even locally homogeneous.
This shows how little information is encoded about the geometry (for instance,
about the isometries) in the spectrum of Laplacian acting on functions.

external electromagnetic radiation resonant to rotational transition has been
developed. It has been shown that one can produce an enrichment of spin isomers
and influence their conversion rates in two ways, through coherences and
through level population change induced by radiation. Influence of conversion
is ranged from significant speed up to almost complete inhibition of the
process by proper choice of frequency and intensity of the external field.
