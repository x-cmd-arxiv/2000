the ultraviolet spectra of the X-ray binary Hercules X-1. Recent HST/STIS
observations of these lines suggest that they are kinematically linked to the
orbital motion of the neutron star and exhibit a red-shifted to blue-shifted
evolution of the line shape during the progression of the eclipse from ingress
to egress which is indicative of disk emission. Furthermore, these lines are
single-peaked which implies that they may be formed in a disk wind similar to
those we have proposed as producing the broad emission lines seen in the UV
spectra of active galactic nuclei. We compute line profiles as a function of
eclipse phase and compare them to the observed line profiles. Various effects
may modify the appearance of the lines including resonant scattering in the
wind itself, self-shadowing of the warped disk from the central continuum, and
self-obscuration of parts of the disk along the observer's line-of-sight. These
latter two effects can cause orbital and precessional phase dependent
variations in the emission lines. Hence, examination of the line profiles as a
function of these phases can, in principle, provide additional information on
the characteristics of the disk warp.

ancient Galactic stellar halo prior to disk formation, based on the present
orbits of metal-poor stars observed in the solar neighborhood. The method
relies on the adiabatic invariance of the action integrals of motion for the
halo population during the slow accumulation of a disk component, subsequent to
earlier halo formation. The method is then applied to a sample of local stars
with [Fe/H]<=-1.5, likely to be dominated by the halo component, taken from
Beers et al.'s recently revised and supplemented catalog of metal-poor stars
selected without kinematic bias. We find that even if the Galactic potential is
made spherical by removing the disk component in an adiabatic manner, the halo
density distribution in the inner halo region (R <= 15 kpc) remains moderately
flattened, with axial ratio of about 0.8 for stars in the abundance range
[Fe/H]<=-1.8 and about 0.7 for the more metal-rich interval -1.8<[Fe/H]<=-1.5.
The outer halo remains spherical for both abundance intervals. We also find
that this initial flattening of the inner halo is caused by the anisotropic
velocity dispersions of the halo stars. These results suggest that the
two-component nature of the present-day stellar halo, characterized by a highly
flattened inner halo and nearly spherical outer halo, is a consequence of both
an initially two-component density distribution of the halo (perhaps a
signature of dissipative halo formation) and of the adiabatic flattening of the
inner part by later disk formation. Further implications of our results for the
formation of the Galaxy are also discussed, in particular in the context of the
hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation.

Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/320636",,"astro-ph",,"  The fragmentation of molecular clouds (MC) into protostellar cores is a
central aspect of the process of star formation. Because of the turbulent
nature of super-sonic motions in MCs, it has been suggested that dense
structures such as filaments and clumps are formed by shocks in a turbulent
flow. In this work we present strong evidence in favor of the turbulent origin
of the fragmentation of MCs. The most generic result of turbulent fragmentation
is that dense post shock gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocity
dispersion than lower density gas, since shocks correspond to regions of
converging flows, where the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is
dissipated. Using synthetic maps of spectra of molecular transitions, computed
from the results of numerical simulations of super--sonic turbulence, we show
that the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas density generates an
observable relation between the rms velocity centroid and the integrated
intensity (column density), Sigma(V_0)-I, which is indeed found in the
observational data. The comparison between the theoretical model (maps of
synthetic 13CO spectra), with 13CO maps from the Perseus, Rosette and Taurus MC
complexes, shows excellent agreement in the Sigma(V_0)-I relation. The
Sigma(V_0)-I relation of different observational maps with the same total rms
velocity are remarkably similar, which is a strong indication of their origin
from a very general property of the fluid equations, such as the turbulent
fragmentation process.

revisited using extensive numerical and scaling analyses. The basic network
shapes and their recurrence especially in the aggregation structure are then
addressed. The roles of boundary and initial conditions are carefully analyzed
as well as the key effect of quenched disorder embedded in random pinning of
the landscape surface. It is found that the above features strongly affect the
scaling behavior of key morphological quantities. In particular, we conclude
that randomly pinned regions (whose structural disorder bears much physical
meaning mimicking uneven landscape-forming rainfall events, geological
diversity or heterogeneity in surficial properties like vegetation, soil cover
or type) play a key role for the robust emergence of aggregation patterns
bearing much resemblance to real river networks.

of the boson-fermion classification resulting in abnormal statistics. We
discuss an appropriate index that counts such short multiplets.
  A broad class of hybrid models which extend the Landau-Ginzburg models to
include a nonflat metric on the target space is considered. Our index turns out
to be related to the index of the Dirac operator on the soliton reduced moduli
space (the moduli space is reduced by factoring out the translational modulus).
The index vanishes in most cases implying the absence of shortening. In
particular, it vanishes when there are only two critical points on the compact
target space and the reduced moduli space has nonvanishing dimension.
  We also generalize the anomaly in the central charge to take into account the

ultra-relativistic perfect fluid, which does not contribute, on classical
level, to the evolution of the isotropic and homogeneous metric. If we suppose
that there is some desert in the particle spectrum just below the Planck mass,
then the effect of conformal trace anomaly is dominating at the corresponding
energies. With some additional constraints on the particle content of the
underlying gauge model (which favor extended or supersymmetric versions of the
Standard Model rather than the minimal one), one arrives at the stable
inflation. We review the model and report about the calculation of the
gravitational waves on the background of the anomaly-induced inflation. The
result for the perturbation spectrum is close to the one for the conventional
inflaton model, and is in agreement with the existing Cobe data (see also
[hep-th/0009197]).

anomaly cancellation in this context is shown to require fractional anomaly
data that can only arise from a twisted sector on the seven-planes, thus
determining the twisted spectrum up to a small ambiguity. These results open
the door to the construction of arbitrary M-theory orbifolds, including those

results originally due to A. Ocneanu are here described in a very elementary
way (manipulation of square or rectangular matrices). We recall the concept of
essential matrices (intertwiners) for a graph and describe their module
properties with respect to right and left actions of fusion algebras. In the
case of the graph E6, essential matrices build up a right module with respect
to its own fusion algebra but a left module with respect to the fusion algebra
of A11. We present two original results: 1) Our first contribution is to show
how to recover the Ocneanu graph of quantum symmetries of the Dynkin diagram E6
from the natural multiplication defined in the tensor square of its fusion
algebra (the tensor product should be taken over a particular subalgebra); this
is the Cayley graph for the two generators of the twelve dimensional algebra E6
\otimes_A3 E6 and E6 refer to the commutative fusion algebras of the
corresponding graphs). 2) To every point of the graph of quantum symmetries one
can associate a particular matrix describing the `` torus structure'' of the
chosen Dynkin diagram; following Ocneanu, one obtains in this way, in the case
of E6, twelve such matrices of dimension 11x11, one of them is a modular
invariant and encodes the partition function of the corresponding conformal
field theory. Our own next contribution is to provide a simple algorithm for
the determination of these matrices.

self-consistency are studied in some detail. A coupled set of Dyson-Schwinger
equations for the renormalized baryon and meson propagators in the $\sigma
-\omega$ model is solved self-consistently according to the dressed
Hartree-Fock scheme, where the hadron propagators in both the baryon and meson
self-energies are required to also satisfy this coupled set of equations. It is
found that the self-consistency affects the baryon spectral function
noticeably, if only the interaction with $\sigma$ mesons is considered.
However, there is a cancellation between the effects due to the $\sigma$ and
$\omega$ mesons and the additional contribution of $\omega$ mesons makes the
above effect insignificant. In both the $\sigma$ and $\sigma -\omega$ cases the
effects of self-consistency on meson spectral function are perceptible, but
they can nevertheless be taken account of without a self-consistent
calculation. Our study indicates that to include the meson propagators in the
self-consistency requirement is unnecessary and one can stop at an early step
of an iteration procedure to obtain a good approximation to the fully
self-consistent results of all the hadron propagators in the model, if an
appropriate initial input is chosen. Vertex corrections and their effects on
ghost poles are also studied.

to solve a counting problem to determine l.
  In this paper, we study the multi-object quantum search algorithm (in
continuous time), but in a more structured way by taking into account the
availability of partial information. The modeling of available partial
information is done simply by the combination of several prescribed, possibly
overlapping, information sets with varying weights to signify the reliability
of each set. The associated statistics is estimated and the algorithm
efficiency and complexity are analyzed.
  Our analysis shows that the search algorithm described here may not be more
efficient than the unstructured (generalized) multi-object Grover search if
there is ``misplaced confidence''. However, if the information sets have a
``basic confidence'' property in the sense that each information set contains
at least one search item, then a quadratic speedup holds on a much smaller data
space, which further expedite the quantum search for the first item.

We provide numerical evidence that the time of the break between the quantum

a characteristic system action. However, this log break-time rule applies only
while the quantum-classical deviations are smaller than order hbar. We find
that the quantum observables remain well approximated by classical Liouville

introduce the decoherence effects of a many degree-of-freedom environment.
