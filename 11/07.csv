structure formation, caused during the merging events of galaxy clusters, or by
the accretion onto galaxy clusters. We argue, that this is a highly plausible
explanation for the observed cluster radio relics, which are the regions of
diffuse radio emission found in clusters of galaxies, without any likely parent
radio galaxy seen nearby. An implication of this model is the existence of a
population of diffuse, ultra-steep spectrum, very low frequency radio sources
located inside and possibly outside of clusters of galaxies, tracing the
revival of aged fossil radio plasma by the shock waves associated with

  1. A sophisticated and consistent description of line blocking and
blanketing. Our solution concept renders the line blocking influence on the
ionizing fluxes (mainly the EUV and UV are affected) in identical quality as
the synthetic high resolution spectra representing the observable region. Line
blanketing is properly accounted for in the energy balance.
  2. A considerably improved and enhanced atomic data archive providing the
basis for a detailed multilevel NLTE treatment of the metal ions (from C to Zn)
and an adequate representation of line blocking and the radiative line
acceleration.
  3. A revised inclusion of EUV and X-ray radiation produced by cooling zones
originating from shock heated matter.
  This new tool not only provides an easy to use method for O-star diagnostics,
whereby physical constraints on the properties of stellar winds, stellar
parameters, and abundances can be obtained via a comparison of observed and
synthetic spectra, but also allows the astrophysically important information
about the ionizing fluxes of hot stars to be determined automatically. Results
illustrating this are discussed by means of a basic model grid calculated for
O-stars with solar metallicity. To further demonstrate the astrophysical
potential of our new method we provide a first detailed spectral diagnostic

theoretical equilibrium radius of large, perfectly absorbing, 150 K grains

have a height of at least 1 AU to account for the fractional dust luminosity of

most stars arrive on the main sequence surrounded by a disk; this disk then
decays in about 400 Myr. Because (i) the dust particles disappear and must be
replenished on a much shorter time scale and (ii) the collision of
planetesimals is a good source of new dust, we suggest that the rapid decay of
the disks is caused by the destruction and escape of planetesimals. We suggest
that the dissipation of the disk is related to the heavy bombardment phase in
our Solar System. Whether all stars arrive on the main sequence surrounded by a
disk cannot be established: some very young stars do not have a disk. And not
all stars destroy their disk in a similar way: some stars as old as the Sun

Using a new age indicator, Hgamma_sigma<130, which is particularly effective at
breaking the degeneracy between age and metallicity, we confirm the discrepancy
between the spectroscopic age and the CMD age of 47 Tuc, in that the
spectroscopic age is much older. Nebular emission appears unlikely to be a
source for weakening the observed Balmer lines. We then explore a number of key
parameters affecting the temperature of Turn-Off stars, which are the main

Hubble parameter (H_0) over cosmological distances, and B0218+357 is one of the
most promising systems for an application of this technique. In particular this
system has an accurately measured time delay (10.5+/-0.4 d; Biggs et al. 1999)
and preliminary mass modelling has given a value for H_0 of 69 +13/-19
km/s/Mpc. The error on this estimate is now dominated by the uncertainty in the
mass modelling. As this system contains an Einstein ring it should be possible
to constrain the model better by imaging the ring at high resolution. To
achieve this we have combined data from MERLIN and the VLA at a frequency of 5
GHz. In particular MERLIN has been used in multi-frequency mode in order to
improve substantially the aperture coverage of the combined data set. The
resulting map is the best that has been made of the ring and contains many new
and interesting features. Efforts are currently underway to exploit the new
data for lensing constraints using the LensClean algorithm (Kochanek & Narayan
1992).

of this energy through Joule heating in the ionosphere can be studied via the

frequency spectrum of this index has motivated investigation of whether it can
be described as fractal coloured noise. One frequently-applied test for
self-affinity is to demonstrate linear scaling of the logarithm of the
structure function of a time series with the logarithm of the dilation factor
$\lambda$. We point out that, while this is conclusive when applied to signals
that are self-affine over many decades in $\lambda$, such as Brownian motion,
the slope deviates from exact linearity and the conclusions become ambiguous
when the test is used over shorter ranges of $\lambda$. We demonstrate that non
self-affine time series made up of random pulses can show near-linear scaling
over a finite dynamic range such that they could be misinterpreted as being
self-affine. In particular we show that pulses with functional forms such as
those identified by Weimer within the $AL$ index, from which $AE$ is partly
derived, will exhibit nearly linear scaling over ranges similar to those
previously shown for $AE$ and $AL$. The value of the slope, related to the
Hurst exponent for a self-affine fractal, seems to be a more robust
discriminator for fractality, if other information is available.

1354-64 (BW Cir) at X-ray, optical and, for the first time, radio wavelengths;
this includes upper limits to the linear and circular polarisation of the radio
data. The X-ray outburst was unusual in that the source remained in the
low/hard X-ray state throughout; the X-ray peak was also preceded by at least
one optical outburst, suggesting that it was an `outside-in' outburst - similar
to those observed in dwarf novae systems, although possibly taking place on a
viscous timescale in this case. It therefore indicates that the optical
emission was not dominated by the reprocessing of X-rays but that instead we
see the instability directly. While the radio source was too faint to detect
any extended structure, spectral analysis of the radio data and a comparison
with other similar systems suggests that mass ejections, probably in the form
of a jet, took place and that the emitted synchrotron spectrum may have
extended as far as infrared wavelengths. Finally, we compare this 1997 outburst
of GS 1354-64 with possible previous outbursts and also with other hard state
objects, both transient and persistent. It appears that a set of
characteristics -- such as a weak, flat spectrum radio jet, a mHz QPO
increasing in frequency, a surprisingly high optical:X-ray luminosity ratio and
the observed optical peak preceding the X-ray peak -- may be common to all hard

revealed an anomalous ridge of inelastic scattering centered ~0.2 A-1 from the
zone center (Gehring et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5216 (2000)). This ridge of
scattering resembles a waterfall when plotted as a phonon dispersion diagram,
and extends vertically from the transverse acoustic (TA) branch near 4 meV to
the transverse optic (TO) branch near 9 meV. No zone center optic mode was
found. We report new results from an extensive neutron scattering study of pure
PZN that exhibits the same waterfall feature. We are able to model the dynamics
of the waterfall using a simple coupled-mode model that assumes a strongly
q-dependent optic mode linewidth Gamma1(q) that increases sharply near 0.2 A-1
as one approaches the zone center. This model was motivated by the results of
Burns and Dacol in 1983, who observed the formation of a randomly-oriented
local polarization in PZN at temperatures far above its ferroelectric phase
transition temperature. The dramatic increase in Gamma1 is believed to occur
when the wavelength of the optic mode becomes comparable to the size of the
small polarized micro-regions (PMR) associated with this randomly-oriented
local polarization, with the consequence that longer wavelength optic modes
cannot propagate and become overdamped. Below Tc=410 K, the intensity of the
waterfall diminishes. At lowest temperatures ~30 K the waterfall is absent, and
we observe the recovery of a zone center transverse optic mode near 10.5 meV.

These growing networks are built by adding nodes successively and linking each
to an earlier node of degree k with attachment probability A_k. When A_k grows
slower than linearly with k, the number of nodes with k links, N_k(t), decays
faster than a power-law in k, while for A_k growing faster than linearly in k,
a single node emerges which connects to nearly all other nodes. When A_k is
asymptotically linear, N_k(t) tk^{-nu}, with nu dependent on details of the
attachment probability, but in the range 2<nu<infty. The combined age and
degree distribution of nodes shows that old nodes typically have a large
degree. There is also a significant correlation in the degrees of neighboring
nodes, so that nodes of similar degree are more likely to be connected. The
size distributions of the in-components and out-components of the network with
respect to a given node -- namely, its ""descendants"" and ""ancestors"" -- are

t and it provides basic insights about the genealogy of the network.

propositions states that if there is a second Killing vector, which together
with the one generating the axial symmetry, forms the basis of a
two-dimensional Lie algebra, then the two Killing vectors must commute, thus
generating an Abelian group. In this paper a similar result, valid under
considerably weaker assumptions, is derived: any two-dimensional Lie
transformation group which contains a one-dimensional subgroup whose orbits are
circles, must be Abelian. The method used to prove this result is extended to
apply three-dimensional Lie transformation groups. It is shown that the
existence of a one-dimensional subgroup with closed orbits restricts the
Bianchi type of the associated Lie algebra to be I, II, III, VII_0, VIII or IX.
Some results on n-dimensional Lie groups are also derived and applied to show
there are severe restrictions on the structure of the allowed four-dimensional

to extract SPFs from the imaginary-time correlation functions numerically
obtained by the Monte Carlo method. Three important aspects of MEM are (i) it
does not require a priori assumptions or parametrizations of SPFs, (ii) for
given data, a unique solution is obtained if it exists, and (iii) the
statistical significance of the solution can be quantitatively analyzed.
  The ability of MEM is explicitly demonstrated by using mock data as well as
lattice QCD data. When applied to lattice data, MEM correctly reproduces the
low-energy resonances and shows the existence of high-energy continuum in
hadronic correlation functions. This opens up various possibilities for
studying hadronic properties in QCD beyond the conventional way of analyzing
the lattice data. Future problems to be studied by MEM in lattice QCD are also
summarized.

class of models where soft supersymmetry breaking terms are determined by quasi
model independent anomaly mediated contributions, with possibly non-vanishing
scalar masses at the one loop level. We show that the latter contribution
depends on the detailed prescription of the regularization process which is
assumed to represent the Planck scale physics of the underlying fundamental
theory. The usual anomaly mediation case with vanishing scalar masses at one
loop is not found to be generic. However gaugino masses and A-terms always
vanish at tree level if supersymmetry breaking is moduli dominated with the
moduli stabilized at self-dual points, whereas the vanishing of the B-term
depends on the origin of the mu-term in the underlying theory. We also discuss
the supersymmetric spectrum of O-I and O-II models, as well as a model of
gaugino condensation. For reference, explicit spectra corresponding to a Higgs

product of constant matrix algebra and the Moyal-Weyl deformation. We propose
scenarios in which the two become intertwined and inseparable. Therefore the
usual separation of ordinary or noncommutative space from the internal discrete
space responsible for non-Abelian symmetry is really the exceptional case of an
unified structure. We call it non-Abelian geometry. This general structure
emerges when multiple D-branes are configured suitably in a flat but varying B
field background, or in the presence of non-Abelian gauge field background. It
can also occur in connection with Taub-NUT geometry. We compute the deformed

temperature limit, where the $1+d$ dimensions are the ordinary flat Minkowski
spacetimes and the $L$ extra two-dimensional tori are chosen to be the
noncommutative torus with noncommutativity $\theta$. The corrections to the
Kaluza-Klein mass formula are evaluated and used to compute the Casimir energy
with the help of the Schwinger perturbative formula in the zeta-function
regularization method. The results show that the one-loop Casimir energy is
independent of the radius of torus if L=1. However, when $L>1$ the Casimir
energy could give repulsive force to stabilize the extra noncommutative torus
if $d-L$ is a non-negative even integral. This therefore suggests a possible
stabilization mechanism of extra radius in high temperature, when the extra
spaces are noncommutative.
