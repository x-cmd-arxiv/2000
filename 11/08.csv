have found that the geometry of the Universe is very close to flat, but
slightly closed models are favoured. In this paper we will briefly review how
the CMB anisotropies depend on the curvature, explaining any assumptions we
could make and showing that this skewness towards closed models can be easily
explained by degeneracies in the cosmological parameters. While it is difficult
to give independent constraints on the cosmological constant and/or different

other observational data will introduce new and tighter constraints, like
$\Omega_\Lambda > 0$ at high significance.

gravitational force points outward near the origin in the equatorial plane. (In
our coordinates an outward gravitational force corresponds to $\partial\ln

attainable by uniform rotation, and that for fixed values of baryon number the
maximum mass configurations are all characterized by an off-center density

combination has been suggested to be a useful method to identify dusty
starburst galaxies at any redshift on the basis of optical data alone. We
compare the average e(a) optical spectrum with synthetic spectra that include
both the stellar and the nebular contribution, allowing dust extinction to
affect differentially the stellar populations of different ages. We find that
reproducing the e(a) spectrum requires the youngest stellar generations to be
significantly more extinguished by dust than older stellar populations, and
implies a strong ongoing star formation activity at a level higher than in
quiescent spirals. A model fitting the optical spectrum does not necessarily
produce the observed FIR luminosity and this can be explained by the existence
of stellar populations which are practically obscured at optical wavelengths.
Models in which dust and stars are uniformly mixed yield a reddening of the
emerging emission lines which is too low compared to observations: additional
foreground reddening is required.

probabilistic Receptor Affinity Distribution model of olfaction. Our system
consists on N sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing
linear threshold element. The system's aim is to model discrimination of a
single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants, within a
range of odorant concentrations. We show that this is possible provided p does
not exceed a critical value p_c, and calculate the critical capacity \alpha_c =
p_c/N. The critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which
the discrimination is to be accomplished. If the olfactory bulb may be thought
of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the
discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis
of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb. The
mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the
capacity for linear separability of continuous curves, embedded in a large
dimensional space. This is accomplished here by a numerical study, using a
method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable or not,
together with a finite size scaling analysis.

Using a special energy injection mechanism, homogeneous fluidized stationary
states are obtained. Molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis of
the inelastic hard-disk model show that there is a large asymmetry in the

Large velocity correlations appear in the postcollisional states, due to the
dissipative character of the collision rule. These correlations can be well
characterized by a state dependent pair correlation function at contact.
  It is also found that velocity correlations are present for pairs that are
about to collide. Particles arrive to collisions with a higher probability that
their velocities are parallel rather that antiparallel. These dynamical
correlations lead to a decrease of the pressure and of the collision frequency
as compared to their Enskog values. A phenomenological modified equation of

term view, we ask what the ultimate limits of such a system might be. To this
end, we consider a very general version of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation
(with a 3-tensor position-dependent mass and arbitrary nonlinearity). Such
equations can be used for example in discussing Bose-Einstein condensates in
heterogeneous and highly nonlinear systems. We demonstrate that at low momenta
linearized excitations of the phase of the condensate wavefunction obey a
(3+1)-dimensional d'Alembertian equation coupling to a (3+1)-dimensional
Lorentzian-signature ``effective metric'' that is generic, and depends
algebraically on the background field. Thus at low momenta this system serves
as an analog for the curved spacetime of general relativity. In contrast at
high momenta we demonstrate how to use the eikonal approximation to extract a
well-controlled Bogoliubov-like dispersion relation, and (perhaps unexpectedly)
recover non-relativistic Newtonian physics at high momenta. Bose-Einstein
condensates appear to be an extremely promising analog system for probing

general relativity to calculate the complete gravitational wavetrain emitted
during the inspiral phase of compact binaries. The QE method exploits the fact
that the the gravitational radiation inspiral timescale is much longer than the
orbital period everywhere outside the ISCO. Here we demonstrate the validity
and advantages of the QE scheme by solving a model problem in relativistic
scalar gravitation theory. By adopting scalar gravitation, we are able to
numerically track without approximation the damping of a simple, quasi-periodic
radiating system (an oscillating spherical matter shell) to final equilibrium,
and then use the exact numerical results to calibrate the QE approximation
method. In particular, we calculate the emitted gravitational wavetrain three
different ways: by integrating the exact coupled dynamical field and matter
equations, by using the scalar-wave monopole approximation formula
(corresponding to the quadrupole formula in general relativity), and by
adopting the QE scheme. We find that the monopole formula works well for weak
field cases, but fails when the fields become even moderately strong. By
contrast, the QE scheme remains quite reliable for moderately strong fields,
and begins to breakdown only for ultra-strong fields. The QE scheme thus
provides a promising technique to construct the complete wavetrain from binary
inspiral outside the ISCO, where the gravitational fields are strong, but where
the computational resources required to follow the system for more than a few
orbits by direct numerical integration of the exact equations are prohibitive.

only for the decay modes into gauge bosons, but most notably in the case of the

most. Therefore, detection of FCNC top quark decays in a future high-energy,

only the Higgs channels can have rates reaching the detectable level (10^{-5}),
with a maximum of order 10^{-4} which is compatible with the charged Higgs
bounds from radiative B-meson decays. We compare with the previous results

through an optical fiber is a key element in the so called information
revolution. However, like all exponential growth laws, there are physical
limits to be considered. The nonlinear nature of the propagation of light in
optical fiber has made these limits difficult to elucidate. Here we obtain
basic insights into the limits to the information capacity of an optical fiber
arising from these nonlinearities. The key simplification lies in relating the
nonlinear channel to a linear channel with multiplicative noise, for which we
are able to obtain analytical results. In fundamental distinction to the linear
additive noise case, the capacity does not grow indefinitely with increasing
signal power, but has a maximal value. The ideas presented here have broader
implications for other nonlinear information channels, such as those involved
in sensory transduction in neurobiology. These have been often examined using
additive noise linear channel models, and as we show here, nonlinearities can
change the picture qualitatively.
