we now have a sample of 18 WAT-containing clusters with more than 10 redshifts.
This sample contains a substantial portion of the WAT clusters in the VLA 20 cm
survey of Abell clusters, including 75% of WAT clusters in the complete survey
(z<=0.09), and 20% of WAT clusters with z>0.09. It is a representative sample
which should not contain biases other than selection by radio morphology. We
graphically present the new data using histograms and sky maps. A
semi-automated procedure is used to search for emission lines in the spectra in
order to add and verify galaxy redshifts. We find that the average apparent
fraction of emission line galaxies is about 9% in both the clusters and the
field. We investigate the magnitude completeness of our redshift surveys with
CCD data for a test case, Abell 690. This case indicates that our galaxy target
lists are deeper than the detection limit of a typical MX exposure, and they
are 82% complete down to R=19.0. The importance of the uniformity of the
placement of fibers on targets is posited, and we evaluate this in our
datasets. We find some cases of non-uniformities which may influence dynamical
analyses. A second paper will use this database to look for correlations
between the WAT radio morphology and the cluster's dynamical state.

marginal. No significant periodicity is detected at both 6 and 20 cm. Since the
sampling function is irregular we performed a number of tests to insure that
the observed periodicity is not the result of noise. Similar results were found
for a maximum entropy method and periodogram with CLEAN method. The probability
of false detection for several different noise distributions is less than 5%

investigations of this possibility have used simple models to show that the 2
degree Field (2dF) redshift survey could yield several tens of new lenses, and
that the larger Sloan Digital Sky Survey should contain an order of magnitude
more. However the particular selection effects of the samples were not included
in these calculations, limiting the robustness of the predictions; thus a more
detailed simulation of the 2dF survey was undertaken here. The use of an
isophotal magnitude limit reduces both the depth of the sample and the expected
number of lenses, but more important is the Automatic Plate Measuring survey's
star-galaxy separation algorithm, used to generate the 2dF input catalogue. It
is found that most quasar lenses are classed as merged stars, with only the few
lenses with low-redshift deflectors likely to be classified as galaxies.
Explicit inclusion of these selection effects implies that the 2dF survey
should contain 10 lenses on average. The largest remaining uncertainty is the
lack of knowledge of the ease with which any underlying quasars can be
extracted from the survey spectra.

of warm gas in the SMC, which supports the idea that this HVC is part of the
tidally stripped Leading Arm of the Magellanic Stream. The abundance pattern
implies that the HVC contains dust grains that have been processed
significantly. It is likely that the grain mantles have been modified or
stripped back to expose the grain cores. We have identified more than 30 lines
of H2 arising in the HVC from rotational levels J = 0 to J = 3. Synthetic
spectra and a curve-of-growth fit to these lines with b = 12 km/sec indicate
that log N(H2) = 16.80+/-0.10 and f(H2) = 2N(H2)/[N(H I)+2N(H2)] = 0.0016. From

the nature of outburst mechanism and to looking for GRB progenitors. Several
types of progenitors were proposed for GRBs. Most promising objects are
collapsars, compact object binaries, Helium star mergers and recently discussed
supernovae. In this paper we consider four proposed binary star progenitors of
GRBs: double neutron star (NS-NS), black hole neutron star (BH-NS), black hole
white dwarf (BH-WD) mergers and Helium star mergers (He-BH). Helium star
mergers are a possible outcome of common envelope evolution of a compact object
entering the envelope of a giant with a helium core.
  Using population synthesis we calculate number of the binary progenitors and
show that BH-WD and Helium star mergers dominate population of the proposed
binary progenitors. Comparison of distribution of different binary mergers
around galaxies they are born in, with localization of GRB afterglows in their
host galaxies shows that only Helium mergers may be responsible for GRBs with
observed afterglows while it excludes NS-NS, BH-NS and BH-WD systems as GRB
progenitors. Assuming that all GRBs come from Helium star mergers and comparing

by oxygen burning; this leads to larger ratios of ""Si""/O in the ejecta.
Enhancement of the mass ratio between complete and incomplete Si-burning
regions in the ejecta may explain the abundance ratios among iron-peak elements
in metal-poor stars. Also the enhanced ""Si""/O ratio may explain the abundance
ratios observed in star burst galaxies. We also discuss other implications of
enhanced [Ti/Fe] and [Fe/O] for Galactic chemical evolution and the abundances

magnetospheres, in which the poloidal magnetic field is generated by a toroidal
electric current in a thin disk with the inner edge, by solving the vacuum
Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild background. In this work, to obtain a
concise analytical form of the magnetic stream function, we use the
approximation that the inner edge is far distant from the event horizon. The
global magnetospheric structure with the closed-loop and open field lines
threading the inner and outer parts of the disk is explicitly shown, claiming
that the model is useful as a starting point to study astrophysical problems
involving inward disk-driven winds to a black hole and outward ones to
infinity. The asymptotic shape of the field lines at the event horizon becomes
nearly cylindrical, while at infinity it becomes conical. The magnetic spot in
the disk connected with the black hole through the loop field lines occupies a
very narrow region with the ring area roughly equal to the horizon area. By
taking account of the existence of a uniform (external) magnetic field, we also
obtain the model for collimated open field lines. Then, it is found that the
magnetic connection between the black hole and the disk breaks down if the
uniform field is strong enough. Considering slow rotation of the magnetosphere
and angular momentum transfer by inward winds from the disk, the final
discussion is devoted to gradual disruption of the closed loops due to radial
accretion of disk plasma toward the black hole.

similar re-observational strategy applied to the cluster A2199 revealed that
the background radial profile was consistent with a flat distribution, and
therefore the original method of extracting cluster EUV signals by the
subtraction of an aymptotically determined background was valid. It is shown
here that the same conclusions hold for the current sample. A model of the
background was obtained from its known properties and the {\it in situ}
measurements, and the subtracted cluster fluxes remain in agreement with those
reported in our discovery papers. They are also consistent with results from
the most conservative procedure of direct point-to-point subtraction of the
{\it in situ} background and proper error propagation, which still preserves
the existence of the EUV excess and its rising radial trend. We present
evidence which argues against the soft excess as due to peculiarities in the

cosmic microwave background (CMB) results from BOOMERANG and MAXIMA, which show
an unexpectedly low second acoustic peak, resulting in a best-fit baryon
density that is 50% larger than the prediction of big-bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN). This apparent discrepancy can be avoided if the universe has a
non-standard ionization history in which the recombination of hydrogen is
significantly delayed relative to the standard model. While future CMB
observations may eliminate this discrepancy, it is useful to develop a general
framework for analyzing non-standard ionization histories. We develop such a
framework, examining non-standard models in which the hydrogen binding energy
E_b and the overall expression for the time rate of change of the ionized
fraction of electrons are multiplied by arbitrary factors. This set of models
includes a number of previously-proposed models as special cases. We find a
wide range of models with delayed recombination that are able to fit the CMB
data with a baryon density in accordance with BBN, but there are even allowed
models with earlier recombination than in the standard model. A generic
prediction of these models is that the third acoustic CMB peak should be very
low relative to what is found in the standard model. This is the case even for
the models with earlier recombination than in the standard model, because here
the third peak is lowered by an increased diffusion damping at recombination
relative to the standard model. Interestingly, the specific height of the third
peak depends sensitively on the model parameters, so that future CMB
measurements will be able to distinguish between different non-standard
recombination scenarios.

astrometrically stable at the micro-arcsecond level for use in the SIM (Space

make this a rather challenging task. Taking a variety of considerations into
account we argue for K giants as the best type of stars for the grid, mainly
because they can be located at much larger distances than any other type of
star due to their intrinsic brightness. We show that it is possible to identify
suitable candidate grid K giants from existing astrometric catalogs. However,
double stars have to be eliminated from these candidate grid samples, since
they generally produce much larger astrometric jitter than tolerable for the
grid. The most efficient way to achieve this is probably by means of a radial
velocity survey. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we repeatedly
measured the radial velocities for a pre-selected sample of 86 nearby Hipparcos
K giants with precisions of 5-8 m/s. The distribution of the intrinsic radial
velocity variations for the bona-fide single K giants shows a maximum around 20
m/s, which is small enough not to severely affect the identification of stellar
companions around other K giants. We use the results of our observations as
input parameters for Monte-Carlo simulations on the possible design of a radial
velocity survey of all grid stars. Our favored scenario would result in a grid
which consists to 68% of true single stars and to 32% of double or multiple
stars with periods mostly larger than 200 years, but only 3.6% of all grid
stars would display astrometric jitter larger than 1 microarcsecond. This

through the network from one scientist to another, and a variety of measures of
connectedness within a network, such as closeness and betweenness. We further

strength of collaborative ties and propose a measure of this strength based on
the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists, and the number of other

arrays. The two characteristic energy scales in these systems are the Josephson

electron charge to a neutral island. The phenomena described in this review
stem from the competition between single electron effects with the Josephson
effect. One example is the (quantum) Superconductor-Insulator phase transition
which occurs by varying the ratio between the coupling constants and/or by
means of external magnetic/electric fields. We will describe how the phase
diagram depends on the various control paramters and the transport properties
close to the quantum critical point. The relevant topological excitations on

exhibit quantum behaviour. We will report on the various experiments and

volume interactions that exist between various parts of a polymer chain by
incorporating a narrow Gaussian repulsive potential between pairs of beads on
the Rouse chain (cond-mat/0002448). The narrow Gaussian potential is
characterized by two parameters: z* - which accounts for the strength of the
interaction, and d* - which accounts for the extent of the interaction. In the
limit of d* going to zero, the narrow Gaussian potential tends to the more
commonly used delta-function repulsive potential. The influence of the
parameter d*, in the limit of infinite chain length, on equilibrium and linear
viscoelastic properties, and on universal ratios involving these properties, is
examined here. A renormalization group calculation of the end-to-end vector
suggests that the value chosen for the variable d* will not affect critical
exponents, or universal ratios. A similar trend is also observed for results
obtained with an approximate solution, which is based on the assumption that
the non-equilibrium configurational distribution function is Gaussian.

transformed to Landau gauge. After Fourier transformation, large momentum
amplitudes are suppressed (filtered) by a variable amount, and the
configurations are transformed back to x-space. Spectacular peaks in electric
and magnetic field strengths are found, which share many properties with either
almost pointlike instantons in regular gauge or with extended anti-instantons
in singular gauge. The environment around those peaks are visualized with
respect to the action, to the topological charge density, to the gauge fields
and to electric and magnetic field strengths. The density of the peaks is of
order 1 / fm**4, and it scales according to the string tension under a
variation of the coupling constant. The evolution of the peaks under the amount
of Fourier filtering is visualy compared to the evolution under cooling, and
the gauge dependence of the peaks is discussed. Advantages and shortcomings of
this method are discussed, with emphasis on possible strong distortions of the
action and topological charge density, which become gauge dependent. Finally, I
compare the character of the SU(2)-configurations to those of noncompact
abelian theory.

relations between the corresponding microscopic spectral densities of QCD3 and
QCD4. Replica calculations, which are exact for QCD4 at half-integer
topological charge, thus result in exact expressions for the microscopic
spectral density of the QCD3 Dirac operator. Second, we derive Virasoro
constraints for the QCD3 partition function. They uniquely determine the
small-mass expansion of the partition function and the corresponding sum rules
for inverse Dirac eigenvalues. Due to de Wit-'t Hooft poles, the replica limit
only reproduces the small mass expansion of the resolvent up to a finite number
of terms. Third, the large mass expansion of the resolvent is obtained from the
replica limit of a loop expansion of the QCD3 partition function. Because of
Duistermaat-Heckman localization exact results are obtained for the microscopic

Au interactions for various charge multiplicities can be reproduced by a
hadronic initial state with reduction in the masses of the vector mesons in the
thermal bath. Though such an effect may also be achieved by a large broadening
of the spectral function we show that the photon spectra is insensitive to
this. It is found that for higher multiplicities a good description of the data
can also be obtained with quark gluon plasma initial state if the reduction of
the vector meson masses in the mixed and hadronic phases is taken into account.
We observe that a thermal source with initial temperature ~ 200 MeV can
reproduce the observed enhancement in the low mass region of the dilepton
spectra. It is not possible to state which one of the two initial states (QGP
or hadronic) is compatible with the data. These findings are in agreement with
our earlier results obtained from the analysis of the WA98 photon spectra. We
estimate the number of pion-pion collisions near the rho-peak of the dilepton
spectra and argue that thermal equilibrium may have been achieved in the
system, justifying the use of hydrodynamical model to describe the space time
evolution.

the nuclear EOS. These effects are quite large and dominate over the

of neutron/proton effective masses of relevance for transport properties of

by fluctuating pressure gradients is fundamental to transport and mixing in
turbulence. It is essential in cloud formation and atmospheric transport,
processes in stirred chemical reactors and combustion systems, and in the
industrial production of nanoparticles. The perspective of particle
trajectories has been used successfully to describe mixing and transport in
turbulence, but issues of fundamental importance remain unresolved. One such
issue is the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction of fluid particle accelerations,
based on the 1941 scaling theory of Kolmogorov (K41). Here we report
acceleration measurements using a detector adapted from high-energy physics to
track particles in a laboratory water flow at Reynolds numbers up to 63,000. We
find that universal K41 scaling of the acceleration variance is attained at
high Reynolds numbers. Our data show strong intermittency---particles are
observed with accelerations of up to 1,500 times the acceleration of gravity
(40 times the root mean square value). Finally, we find that accelerations
manifest the anisotropy of the large scale flow at all Reynolds numbers
studied.

incompressible flows, both Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic. For
uniform-density fluids with standard Newtonian viscous terms, taking the
divergence of the equation of motion leaves a Poisson equation for the pressure
to be solved. But Poisson equations require boundary conditions. For the case
of rectangular periodic boundary conditions, pressures determined in this way
are unambiguous. But in the presence of ""no-slip"" rigid walls, the equation of
motion can be used to infer both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on
the pressure P, and thus amounts to an over-determination. This has
occasionally been recognized as a problem, and numerical treatments of
wall-bounded shear flows usually have built in some relatively ad hoc dynamical
recipe for dealing with it, often one which appears to ""work"" satisfactorily.
Here we consider a class of solenoidal velocity fields which vanish at no-slip
walls, have all spatial derivatives, but are simple enough that explicit
analytical solutions for P can be given. Satisfying the two boundary conditions
separately gives two pressures, a ""Neumann pressure"" and a ""Dirichlet pressure""
which differ non-trivially at the initial instant, even before any dynamics are
implemented. We compare the two pressures, and find that in particular, they
lead to different volume forces near the walls. This suggests a reconsideration
of no-slip boundary conditions, in which the vanishing of the tangential
velocity at a no-slip wall is replaced by a local wall-friction term in the
equation of motion.

nonuniquely, by another model that expresses conditions of instruments that

result, model A of key distribution can be enveloped in various ways to reveal
alternative models that Eve can try to implement, in conflict with model A and
its promise of security. A different enveloping model can help Alice and Bob by
expressing necessities of synchronization that they manipulate to improve their
detection of eavesdropping. Finally we show that models based on pre-quantum

arbitrary changes on the system parameters, which can be successfully described

off-resonant probability density is characterized by an oscillatory pattern
modulated by the resonant case which governs the duration of the transient
regime. This is evidence that off-resonant and resonant tunneling are two
correlated processes, whose transient regime is characterized by the same
transient time constant of two lifetimes.
