size, in three different cosmological models. We confirm earlier calculations
that on the scales studied the kinetic effect is much smaller than the thermal
(except close to the thermal null point), with an rms dispersion smaller by
about a factor five in the Rayleigh-Jeans region. We study the redshift
dependence of the rms distortion and the pixel distribution at the present
epoch. We compute the angular power spectra of the maps, including their
redshift dependence, and compare them with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect and with the expected cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum as
well as with determinations by other authors. We correlate the kinetic effect
with the thermal effect both pixel-by-pixel and for identified thermal sources
in the maps to assess the extent to which the kinetic effect is enhanced in
locations of strong thermal signal.

which segregation show the strongest dependence. Also, we have explored the
results of our analysis applied to the central regions of the clusters and
their outskirts. We consider a sample of clusters of galaxies with temperature
estimates to derive the projected mass density profile and the 500 density

respectively. The X-ray surface brightness profiles are used to obtain the
projected gas density assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium model. Our results
suggest that the morphological segregation in clusters is controlled by the
local galaxy density in the outskirts. On the other hand, the global projected
mass density, shows the strongest correlation with the fraction of
morphological types in the central high density region, with a marginal
dependence on the local galaxy density.

from these long-slit spectra show rapid rotation (V = 70 km/s at a distance of
0.1 arcsec = 4.9 pc from the nucleus) and increasing velocity dispersion toward
the nucleus (where sigma = 295 +/- 30 km/s). We model the observed stellar
kinematics assuming an axisymmetric mass distribution with both two and three
integrals of motion. Both modeling techniques point to the presence of a
central dark compact mass (which presumably is a supermassive black hole) with
confidence > 99%. The isotropic two-integral models yield a best-fitting black
hole mass of (6.0 +/- 1.4) x 10^7 M_sun and mass-to-light ratio (M/L_V) of 5.38
+/- 0.08, and the goodness-of-fit (chi^2) is insensitive to reasonable values
for the galaxy's inclination. The three-integral models, which
non-parametrically fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distribution as a
function of position in the galaxy, suggest a black hole mass of (3.9 +/- 0.4)
x 10^7 M_sun and M/L_V of 5.56 +/- 0.02 (internal errors), and the edge-on
models are vastly superior fits over models at other inclinations. The internal
dynamics in NGC 1023 as suggested by our best-fit three-integral model shows
that the velocity distribution function at the nucleus is tangentially
anisotropic, suggesting the presence of a nuclear stellar disk. The nuclear
line of sight velocity distribution has enhanced wings at velocities >= 600
km/s from systemic, suggesting that perhaps we have detected a group of stars
very close to the central dark mass.

is the chief cause of scatter in the f_B vs. z diagram: the spread caused by
the richness dependence is comparable to the trend in f_B over a typical
redshift baseline, so that conclusions drawn from smaller samples have varied
widely. The two parameters, z, and a consistently defined projected galaxy

apparent periodicity discovered by Broadhurst et al. (1990). Simulation
particles are tagged as `galaxies' so as to reproduce observed present-day

hypothetical observers to create mock catalogues with the geometry and the
distance distribution of the Broadhurst et al. data. We produce 1936 (2625)
quasi-independent catalogues from our $\tau$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) simulation. A
couple of large clumps in a catalogue can produce a high peak at low
wavenumbers in the corresponding one-dimensional power spectrum, without any
apparent large-scale periodicity in the original redshift histogram. Although
the simulated redshift histograms frequently display regularly spaced clumps,
the spacing of these clumps varies between catalogues and there is no
`preferred' period over our many realisations. We find only a 0.72 (0.49) per
cent chance that the highest peak in the power spectrum of a $\tau$CDM
($\Lambda$CDM) catalogue has a peak-to-noise ratio higher than that in the
Broadhurst et al. data. None of the simulated catalogues with such high peaks
shows coherently spaced clumps with a significance as high as that of the real

obtained at 2.06 microns using BEAR, an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer,
at a spectral resolution of 74 km/s. Sixteen stars were confirmed as helium
stars by detecting the He I 2.058 microns line in emission, providing a
homogeneous set of fully resolved line profiles.
  These observations allow us to discard some of the earlier detections of such
stars in the central cluster and to add three new stars. The sources detected
in the BEAR data were compared with adaptive optics images in the K band to
determine whether the emission was due to single stars. Two sub-classes of
almost equal number are clearly identified from the width of their line
profiles, and from the brightness of their continuum.
  Most of the emission lines show a P Cygni profile. From these results, we
propose that the latter group is formed of stars in or near the LBV phase, and
the other one of stars at the WR stage. The division into two groups is also
shown by their spatial distribution, with the narrow-line stars in a compact
central cluster (IRS 16) and the other group distributed at the periphery of
the central cluster of hot stars. In the same data cube, streamers of
interstellar helium gas are also detected.
  The helium emission traces the densest parts of the SgrA West Mini-Spiral.
Several helium stars have a radial velocity comparable to the velocity of the
interstellar gas in which they are embedded. In the final discussion, all these
findings are examined to present a possible scenario for the formation of very
massive stars in the exceptional conditions of the vicinity of the central
Black Hole.

absorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. Their gas
extinction is found to be large (Av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision of
their star formation rate (SFR) to an average value of ~ 40 Mo/yr. Large
extinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in one
field observed by ISO. Gas metal abundances in LCGs have about half the solar
value. We argue that LCGs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.
LCGs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-day
bulges. As in present-day galactic bulges, LCG stars show a wide range of
abundances. Thus, observing LCGs allows us to directly witness an important
stage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior to
that of the disk. The gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likely
to be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled out
from interacting companion galaxies. Some LCGs also show evidence for the
beginning of a disk formation. If the above scenario holds for most LCGs, we
estimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulk
of their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 Gyr, at
redshifts less than ~ 1. Since they are heavily extincted, we predict their IR
luminosities to be relatively large, around Lir = 10^11 Lsun, i.e. near or
slightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by ISO in the same
redshift range. Taking into account the integrated IR luminosity of the LCG
galaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic SFR
density in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1.

earthquake energy distribution described by the Gutenberg-Richter seismic
moment-frequency law and analyze shallow earthquakes (depth h < 70 km) in the
Harvard catalog over the period 1977-2000 in 18 seismic zones. The whole GPD is
found to approximate the tails of the seismic moment distributions quite well
above moment-magnitudes larger than mW=5.3 and no statistically significant
regional difference is found for subduction and transform seismic zones. We
confirm that the b-value is very different in mid-ocean ridges compared to
other zones (b=1.50=B10.09 versus b=1.00=B10.05 corresponding to a power law
exponent close to 1 versus 2/3) with a very high statistical confidence. We
propose a physical mechanism for this, contrasting slow healing ruptures in
mid-ocean ridges with fast healing ruptures in other zones. Deviations from the
GPD at the very end of the tail are detected in the sample containing
earthquakes from all major subduction zones (sample size of 4985 events). We
propose a new statistical test of significance of such deviations based on the
bootstrap method. The number of events deviating from the tails of GPD in the
studied data sets (15-20 at most) is not sufficient for determining the
functional form of those deviations. Thus, it is practically impossible to give
preference to one of the previously suggested parametric families describing
the ends of tails of seismic moment distributions.

form at certain surfaces of unconventional superconductors. Through studies of
the temperature and field dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth
lambda_ab at low temperature, we have found strong evidence for the presence of
these states in clean single crystal YBCO and BSCCO. Crystals cut to expose a
[110] interface show a strong upturn in lambda_ab at around 7K, when the field
is oriented so that the supercurrents flow around this surface. In YBCO this
upturn is completely suppressed by a field of ~0.1 T.

in Hg1223 with femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy are reported.
  From the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the photoinduced
reflection, the existence of two gaps is deduced, one temperature dependent Dc
that closes at Tc, and another temperature independent ''pseudogap'' Dp. The
zero-temperature magnitudes of the two gaps are Dc/kTc = 6 +/- 0.5 and Dp/kTc =
6.4 +/- 0.5 respectively. The quasiparticle lifetime is found to exhibit a
divergence as T -> Tc from below, which is attributed to the existence of a
superconducting gap which closes at Tc. Above Tc the relaxation time is longer
than expected for metallic relaxation, which is attributed to the presence of
the ''pseudogap''. The QP relaxation time is found to increase significantly at
low temperatures. This behavior is explained assuming that at low temperatures
the relaxation of photoexcited quasiparticles is governed by a bi-particle
recombination process.

phase of high-Tc cuprates by using the t-J model with a potential that
stabilizes vertical charge stripes. Charge and spin-correlation functions and
optical conductivity are calculated by using finite-temperature Lanczos method.
At zero temperature, the antiferromagnetic correlation between a spin in a
charge stripe and that in a spin domain adjacent to the stripe is weak, since
the charge stripe and the spin domain are almost separated. With increasing
temperature, the correlation increases and then decreases toward high
temperature. This is in contrast to other correlations that decrease
monotonically. From the examination of the charge dynamics, we find that this
anomalous temperature dependence of the correlation is the consequence of a
crossover from one-dimensional electronic states to two-dimensional ones.

on the magnitude of the contribution that the resistive tails make to the IV

asymmetry of the universe can be generated via a primordial leptogenesis

and leptons live at brane intersections, and are thus located at different
positions in the extra dimensions. Replication of families follows naturally
from the fact that the branes generically intersect at several points. Gauge
and Yukawa couplings can be computed in terms of the compactification radii.
Hierarchical Yukawa couplings appear naturally, since amplitudes involving
three different intersections are proportional to exp{-A_{ijk}}, where A_{ijk}
is the area of a string world-sheet extending among the intersections. The
models are non-supersymmetric but the string scale may be lowered down to 1-10
TeV. The proton is however stable due to a set of discrete symmetries arising
from world-sheet selection rules, exact to all orders in perturbation theory.
The scenario has some distinctive features like the presence of KK, winding and
other new excited states (`gonions'), with masses below the string scale and
accessible to accelerators. The models contain scalar tachyons with the quantum
numbers of standard SU(2) x U(1) Higgs doublets, and we propose that they
induce electroweak symmetry breaking in a somewhat novel way. Specific string
models with D4-branes wrapping on T^2 x (T^2)^2/Z_N, leading to three-family
semirealistic spectra, are presented, in which the above properties are
exemplified.

gauge bosons sector after the Higgs mechanism contains the massive charged
gauge fields, two massless and two massive neutral gauge fields. It is also
shown that, in the tree level, the neutrino couples to one of two `photons',
the electron interacts with both `photons' and there occurs a nontrivial
$\nu_R$-interaction on noncommutative space-times. Our noncommutative GWS model
is reduced to the GWS theory in the commutative limit. Thus in the neutral
gauge bosons sector there are only one massless photon and only one $Z^0$ in
the commutative limit.

the structure of mesons [a_0(980), f_0(975)] and baryons [Lambda(1405)] with

  Hilbert space","A mild update. In particular, I. D. Ivanovic's earlier derivation of
  the expansion is properly acknowledged. 16 pages, one PS figure, 1 table,
  written in RevTeX",,"10.1088/1464-4266/3/3/314",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss a real-valued expansion of any Hermitian operator defined in a
Hilbert space of finite dimension N, where N is a prime number, or an integer
power of a prime. The expansion has a direct interpretation in terms of the
operator expectation values for a set of complementary bases. The expansion can
be said to be the complement of the discrete Wigner function.
  We expect the expansion to be of use in quantum information applications
since qubits typically are represented by a discrete, and finite-dimensional
physical system of dimension N=2^p, where p is the number of qubits involved.
As a particular example we use the expansion to prove that an intermediate
measurement basis (a Breidbart basis) cannot be found if the Hilbert space
dimension is 3 or 4.

  physical idea and argument to define the generalization of the entanglement
  of formation for multi-party systems",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present the generalization of the entanglement of formation for
three-party systems in a pure state. For three qubit system we derive out its
explicit and closed expression which is a linear combination of the binary
entropy functions with various arguments, and these arguments are clearly
determined in terms of the components of state vector of three qubits. As a
reasonable measure of entanglement, the main behaviors and elementary
properties of this generalized entanglement of formation are showed through
discussing some important and interesting examples. Moreover, we propose how to
extend our definition to a mixed state in according to the familiar idea. Then,
we suggest the generalization of the entanglement of formation for multi-party
systems which is consistent with the regular definition for two-party systems
and our definition for three-party systems.

in a harmonic trap. The spectrum is calculated using both the exact summation
and also the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. In the latter case, relatively
simple analytical expressions are obtained for the absorption lineshape at
large number of trapped atoms. At zero temperature, the approximated lineshape
is characterized by a $(1-z^2)^{5/2}$ dependence which agrees well with the
exact numerical calculations. At non-zero temperature, the spectrum becomes
broader, although remains non-Gaussian as long as the fermion gas is
degenerate. The changes in the trap frequency for an electronically excited
atom can introduce an additional line broadening.
