halo globular cluster Palomar 13. The absolute proper motion of Pal 13 with
respect to the background galaxies, derived from moderate scale photographic
plates separated by a 40-year baseline, is $(\mu_{\alpha cos \delta},
\mu_{\delta}) = (+2.30, +0.27) \pm (0.26, 0.25)$ milliarc-seconds per year. The
resultant total space velocity (315 km s$^{-1}$) implies that Pal 13 is in the
inner part of its orbit near perigalacticon. Orbital integration reveals the
cluster to possess an inclined, very eccentric, retrograde orbit. These data
confirm that Pal 13 is a paradigm ""young halo"" globular cluster.
  The derived proper motions for cluster stars are used to produce membership
probabilities and a cleaned CCD UBV catalogue for Pal 13. With this data set we
have made small revisions to Pal 13's distance, metallicity, position and light
profile. The membership of four previously reported RR Lyrae variables and a
proportionally large group of blue straggler stars are confirmed. As expected,
the blue stragglers are centrally concentrated.
  The small size of this cluster, combined with the shape of its light profile,
which shows a clear departure from a classical King function beyond the tidal
radius, suggests that Pal 13 is in the final throes of destruction. This could
explain the large blue straggler specific frequency, as destructive processes
would preferentially strip less massive stars.

form highly ordered arrays. For rectangular arrays the depinning force and
commensurability effects are anisotropic with a much lower depinning threshold
for vortex motion in the easy flow directions. We find evidence for a crossover
in pinning behavior in rectangular pinning arrays as the field is increased. We
also show analytically, and confirm with simulations, that for $B = 2B_{\phi}$
the strongest pinning can be achieved for rectangular pinning arrangements

transitions between different phases are observed which coincide with changes

radiative neutrino mechanism. Neutrino mixings are experimentally suggested to
be maximal in both atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations. By using $L_e -
L_\mu - L_\tau$ ($\equiv L^\prime$)-conservation, which, however, only ensures
the maximal solar neutrino mixing, we find that two-loop radiative mechanism
dynamically generates the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and that the
estimate of $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_{atm} \sim\epsilon m_e/m_\tau$
explains $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_{atm} \ll 1$ because of $m_e/m_\tau \ll
1$, where $\epsilon$ measures the breaking of the $L^\prime$-conservation.
Together with $\Delta m^2_{atm} \approx 3\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$, this estimate
yields $\Delta m^2_\odot \sim 10^{-7}$ eV$^2$ for $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, which
corresponds to the LOW solution to the solar neutrino problem. Neutrino mass
scale is given by $(16\pi^2)^{-2} m_em_\tau /M$ ($M \sim$ 1 TeV), which is of

the associated canonical formalism, solving the problem in previous
formulations of conformal $p$-brane actions where the Hamiltonian can not be

the Weyl symmetry. In the construction of the corresponding supersymmetric
generalization of this conformal $p$-brane action we show that the associated

these approximations, complex predecessors of orbits created in the bifurcation
(``ghost orbits'') can produce clear signatures in the semiclassical spectra.
We demonstrate that these orbits themselves can undergo bifurcations, resulting
in complex, non-generic bifurcation scenarios. We do so by studying an example
taken from the Diamagnetic Kepler Problem. By application of normal form
theory, we construct an analytic description of the complete bifurcation
scenario, which is then used to calculate the pertinent uniform approximation.
The ghost orbit bifurcation turns out to produce signatures in the

would.

obtained by using Darboux transformations with both constant spectral
parameters and variable ""spectral parameters"". These solutions give the
Yang-Mills-Higgs fields in anti-de Sitter space-time. Some examples in SU(2)
case are considered and qualitative asymptotic behaviors of the solutions as t
tends to infinity are discussed in detail.

rotationnal band of the heavy nucleus $^{254}$No recently observed
experimentally. The calculated quadrupole deformation is consistent with the
experimental value of $\beta=0.27$ and is almost constant over the whole band.
We also reproduce fairly well the excitation spectra and moments of inertia of
this isotope up to the maximal experimentally observed state of spin 20. The
rather high stability of this nucleus against fission is illustrated by the
deformation energy curve providing very high fission barriers at zero spin
within the HFB and HFB plus Lipkin-Nogami formalisms. The variation of these
barriers with increased angular velocities is also studied.

the sharers Alice and Bob are allowed to carry out local quantum operations and
classical communication. We prove that the information that Alice and Bob can
gain about a hidden bit is exponentially small in $n$, the number of qubits in
each share, and can be made arbitrarily small for hiding multiple bits. We
indicate an alternative efficient low-entanglement method for preparing the
shared quantum states. We discuss how our scheme can be implemented using
present-day quantum optics.
