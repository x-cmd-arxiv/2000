noncircular motions in the triaxial bar potential and motions in circular

are shown to have similar observational manifestations in the line-of-sight
velocity field of the gas. A reliable criterion is needed fo the observational
data to be properly interpreted. To find such a criterion, we analyze
two-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamics models of gas motions in barred disk
galaxies. The gas line-of-sight velocity and surface brightness distributions
in the plane of the sky are constructed for various inclinations of the
galactic plane to the line-of-sight and bar orientation angles. We show that
using models of circular motions for inclinations $i > 60^\circ$ to analyze the
velocity field can lead to the erroneous conclusions of a ``tilted (polar)
disk'' at the circumnuclear region. However, it is possible to distinguish bars
from tilted disks by comparing the mutual orientations of the photometric and
dynamical axes. As an example, we consider the velocity field of the ionized
gas in the galaxy NGC 972.

of the most metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies known, Tol
1214-277 (Z ~ Zsun/25). The data show that roughly half of the total luminosity
of the BCD originates from a bright and compact starburst region located at the
northeastern tip of a faint dwarf galaxy with cometary appearance. The
starburst has ignited less than 4 Myr ago and its emission is powered by
several thousands O7V stars and ~ 170 late-type nitrogen Wolf-Rayet stars
located within a compact region with < 500 pc in diameter. For the first time
in a BCD, a relatively strong [Fe V] 4227 emission line is seen which together
with intense He II 4686 emission indicates the presence of a very hard
radiation field in Tol 1214-277. We argue that this extraordinarily hard
radiation originates from both Wolf--Rayet stars and radiative shocks in the
starburst region. The structural properties of the low-surface-brightness (LSB)
component underlying the starburst have been investigated by means of surface
photometry down to 28 B mag/sq.arcsec. We find that, for a surface brightness
level fainter than ~ 24.5 B mag/sq.arcsec, an exponential fitting law provides
an adequate approximation to its radial intensity distribution. The broad-band
colors in the outskirts of the LSB component of Tol 1214-277 are nearly
constant and are consistent with an age below one Gyr. This conclusion is
supported by the comparison of the observed spectral energy distribution (SED)
of the LSB host with theoretical SEDs.

of flux measurements would be unimodal. On the other hand, sinusoidal or
square-wave modulation (either periodic or stochastic) may lead to a bimodal
histogram. We here present evidence that the neutrino flux histogram is in fact
bimodal. We analyze all available data from gallium experiments, coordinating
results from the GALLEX and GNO experiments into one data set, and adopting
results from the SAGE experiment as another data set. The two histograms, from
the two data sets, are consistent in showing peaks in the range 45-75 SNU and
90-120 SNU, with a valley in between. By combining the data into one data set,
we may form more detailed histograms; these strengthen the case that the flux
is bimodal. A preliminary statistical analysis indicates that the bimodal
character of the solar neutrino flux is highly significant. Since the upper
peak is close to the expected flux (120-140 SNU), we may infer that the
neutrino deficit is due to time-varying attenuation of the flux produced in the
core. We estimate the time scale of this variation to be in the range 10-60
days. Attenuation that varies on such a time scale is suggestive of the
influence of solar rotation, and points towards a process involving the solar
magnetic field in conjunction with a nonzero neutrino magnetic moment.

of the gas is locked into dense and gravitationally bound cores, which collapse
as proto-stars. This process can be studied with numerical simulations of
super-sonic self-gravitating turbulence.
  In this work, we use numerical simulations of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD),
super-sonic, super-Alfv\'{e}nic and self-gravitating turbulence to compute the
mass distribution of collapsing proto-stellar cores, which are selected as
local density maxima. We find that the mass distribution of collapsing cores is
consistent with the stellar initial mass function (IMF), suggesting that
super-sonic turbulence may be responsible for the generation of the IMF.
  To support this conclusion we also show that the physical properties of the
numerically selected cores are in agreement with the properties of observed
NH$_3$ cores and that their magnetic field strength is consistent with Zeeman
splitting measurements.
  In turbulent MCs, star formation occurs via the gravitational collapse of
super-critical cores, formed by the turbulent flow, sub-critical cores being
irrelevant for the process of star formation.
