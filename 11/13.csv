and they may have interesting cosmological consequences. As was first proved by
Carter and Peter, the equations of motion for chiral cosmic strings in
Minkowski space are integrable (just as for Nambu-Goto strings). Their
solutions are labeled by a function $k(\sigma - t)$ where $t$ is time and
$\sigma$ is the invariant length along the string, and the constraints on $k$,
which determines the charge on the string, are that $0 \leq k^2 \leq 1$. We
review the origin of this parameter and also discuss some general properties of
such strings which can be deduced from the equations of motion. The metric
around infinite chiral strings is then constructed in the weak field limit, and
studied as a function of $k$. We also consider the angular momentum of circular
chiral loops, and extend previous work to consider the evolution and
self-intersection properties of a more general family of chiral cosmic string
loops for which $k^2(\sigma-t)$ is not constant.

early-type galaxies drawn mostly from cluster and group environments using a
homogeneous data-set which is well-calibrated onto the Lick/IDS system. The
small intrinsic scatter in Mg at a given sigma gives upper limits on the spread
in age and metallicity of 49% and 32% respectively, if the spread is attributed
to one quantity only and if the variations in age and metallicity are
uncorrelated. The age/metallicity distribution as inferred from the Hbeta vs
<Fe> diagnostic diagram reinforces this conclusion, as we find mostly galaxies
with large luminosity weighted ages spanning a range in metallicity. In our
sample we do not find significant evidence for an anti-correlation of ages and
metallicities which would keep the index-sigma relations tight while hiding a
large spread in age and metallicity. As a result of correlated errors in the
age-metallicity plane, a mild age-metallicity anti-correlation cannot be
completely ruled out given the current data. Correcting the line-strengths
indices for non-solar abundance ratios following the recent paper by Trager et
al., leads to higher mean metallicity and slightly younger age estimates while
preserving the metallicity sequence. The [Mg/Fe] ratio is mildly correlated
with the central velocity dispersion and ranges from [Mg/Fe]=0.05 to 0.3 for
galaxies with sigma > 100 km/s. Under the assumption that there is no age
gradient along the index-sigma relations, the abundance-ratio corrected
Mg-sigma, <Fe>-sigma and Hbeta-sigma relations give consistent estimates of
Delta [M/H]/ Delta log sigma = 0.9 (+- 0.1). The slope of the Hbeta-sigma
relation limits a potential age trend as a function of sigma to 2-3 Gyrs along
the sequence.(abriged)

powered by black holes accreting rapidly through a disk. The supernova-like
outburst that accompanies some gamma-ray bursts suggest that some long-duration
GRBs may be driven by the accretion of a rotating stellar core onto a central
black hole. Such a system can be produced when a compact remnant spirals into
the helium core of its binary companion. During the inspiral, orbital angular
momentum is injected into the core. By the time the compact remnant reaches the
center of the helium core, it too has gained angular momentum as well as mass,
producing a rapidly accreting black hole (or neutron star) at the center of a
rotating stellar core. In this paper, we use a 3-dimensional smooth particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) code to follow such a merger process and make quantitative
estimates of the initial mass and spin of the central compact remnant, as well
as the angular momentum in the accreting helium core. From these results, we
estimate GRB explosion energies. In all mergers, magnetically driven jets are
expected to produce GRB explosions with energies above 10^{51} ergs. For
neutrino-annihilation-driven explosions, the GRB energy increases dramatically
with helium star mass: the merger of a 2 M_sun compact remnant with a 4 M_sun
helium star only produces a 10^{47} ergs explosion in \sim 500 s whereas the
merger of a 2 M_sun compact remnant with a 16 M_sun helium star produces a

of star formation rate (SFR). However, the effect of the dust-to-gas ratio
(i.e., amount of the dust) on the conversion law from IR luminosity to SFR has
not so far been considered. Then, in this paper, we present a convenient
analytical formula including this effect. In order to obtain the dependence on
the dust-to-gas ratio, we extend the formula derived in our previous paper, in
which a theoretical formula converting IR luminosity to SFR was derived. That
formula was expressed as ${\rm SFR}/(M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1})=\{3.3\times
10^{-10}(1- \eta)/(0.4-0.2f+0.6\epsilon)\} (L_{\rm IR}/L_\odot)$, where f is
the fraction of ionizing photons absorbed by hydrogen, $\epsilon$ is the
efficiency of dust absorption for nonionizing photons, $\eta$ is the cirrus
fraction of observed dust luminosity, and $L_{\rm IR}$ is the observed
luminosity of dust emission in the 8-1000-$\mu$m range. Our formula explains
the IR excess of the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. In the current
paper, especially, we present the metallicity dependence of our conversion law
between SFR and $L_{\rm IR}$. This is possible since both f and $\epsilon$ can
be estimated via the dust-to-gas ratio, which is related to metallicity. We
have confirmed that the relation between the metallicity and the dust-to-gas
ratio is applied to both giant and dwarf galaxies. Finally, we apply the result
to the cosmic star formation history. We find that the comoving SFR at z=3
calculated from previous empirical formulae is underestimated by a factor of
4-5.

preheating. Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the
nearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the
inflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal
state with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice
simulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after
preheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of
generic rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models.
Notably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric
resonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to
exponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly
thermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher
momenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group
into subsets with almost identical characteristics (e.g. group effective
temperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the
groups depend on the couplings between them. We also studied the onset of chaos
after preheating by calculating the Lyapunov exponent of the scalar fields.

acting on a C*-algebra B. We construct a Hilbert module F over the reduced
crossed product of G and B, using a pair (E, R), where E is an equivariant
Hilbert module over B and R is a dense subspace of E with certain properties.
The generalized fixed point algebra is the C*-algebra of compact operators on
F. Any Hilbert module over the reduced crossed product arises by this
construction for a pair (E, R) that is unique up to isomorphism.
  A necessary condition for the existence of R is that E be square-integrable.
The consideration of square-integrable representations of Abelian groups on
Hilbert space shows that this condition is not sufficient and that different
choices for R may yield different generalized fixed point algebras.
  If B is proper in Kasparov's sense, there is a unique R with the required
properties. Thus the generalized fixed point algebra only depends on E.

As a consequence the calculated B(E2) $6_{1}^{+}\to 4_{1}^{+}$ is much stronger
than the $6_{2}^{+}\to 4_{1}^{+}$ and the Gamow-Teller matrix element to the
$6_{2}^{+}$ state vanishes. When using some popular interaction e.g. FPD6 in
single j shell the ordering of the even signature and odd signature states gets
reversed, so that the Gamow-Teller matrix element to the $6^{+}_{1}$ state
vanishes and the $6_{2}^{+}\to 4_{1}^{+}$ E2 transition is the strong one. When
configuration mixing is introduced, the E2 transition $6_{2}^{+}\to 4_{1}^{+}$
persists in being large. However the Gamow-Teller strengths reverse, with the
large matrix element to the $6_{1}^{+}$ state in agreement with experiment.
Static properties $\mu$ and Q for the two $6^{+}$ states are also considered.

produced in peripheral heavy ion reactions around Fermi energy is investigated.
The experimental finding of enhancement of mid-rapidity matter shows the
necessity to include correlations beyond BUU which was performed in the
framework of nonlocal kinetic theory. Different theoretical improvements are
discussed. While the in-medium cross section changes the number of collisions,
it leaves the transferred energy almost unchanged. In contrast the nonlocal
scenario changes the energy transferred during collisions and leads to an
enhancement of mid-rapidity matter. The renormalisation of quasiparticle
energies can be included in nonlocal scenarios and leads to a further
enhancement of mid-rapidity matter distribution. This renormalisation is
accompanied by a dynamical softening of the equation of state seen in longer
oscillation periods of the excited compressional collective mode. We propose to
include quasiparticle renormalisation by using the Pauli-rejected collisions
which circumvent the problem of backflows in Landau theory. Using the maximum
relative velocity of projectile and target like fragments we associate
experimental events with impact parameters of the simulations. For peripheral
collisions we find a reasonable agreement between experiment and theory. For
more central collisions, the velocity damping is higher in one-body simulations
than observed experimentally, because of missing cluster formations in the
kinetic theory used.

visit n cities (randomly distributed over a unit square) before learning that
some cities can be omitted. We find the optimized average length of the pruned
tour follows E(\bar{L}_{pruned}) = \sqrt{np} (0.872-0.105p) f(np) where p is
the probability of a city needing to be visited, and f(np) -> 1 as np ->

is found to follow E(L_{a priori}) =\sqrt{n/p}\beta (p) where \beta
(p)=1/(1.25-0.82 ln(p)) is measured for 0.05 < p < 0.6. Scaling arguments and
indirect measurements suggest that \beta (p) tends towards a constant for
p<0.03. Our stochastic annealing algorithm is based on limited sampling of the
pruned tour lengths, exploiting the sampling error to provide the analogue of
thermal fluctuations in simulated (thermal) annealing. The method has general
application to the optimization of functions whose cost to evaluate rises with
the precision required.
