case of NS and disk counterrotation, the energy release during accretion can
reach $0.67\dot{M}c^2$. The sense of NS rotation is a factor that strongly
affects the observed ratio of nuclear energy release during bursts to
gravitational energy release between bursts in X-ray bursters. The possible

galaxy, 3 x 4 kpc, rotates almost at right angles to this. The line-strength
maps show that the metallicity of the stellar population decreases from a
central value greater than solar, to one-half solar at a radius of 2 kpc. The
decoupled core and main body of the galaxy have the same luminosity-weighted
age, of ~14 Gyr, and the same elevated magnesium-to-iron ratio. The two
kinematically distinct components have thus shared a common star formation
history. We infer that the galaxy underwent a sequence of mergers associated
with dissipative star formation that ended >12 Gyr ago. The misalignment
between the photometric and kinematic axes of the main body is unambiguous
evidence of triaxiality. The similarity of the stellar populations in the two

simple, well-motivated models of galaxy identification and star formation,
while our second simulation also includes a simple ``blow-out'' model of galaxy
outflows in which supernova driven winds from newly formed disk galaxies
punch-out and shock the intergalactic medium while leaving the host galaxies
intact. A direct comparison between these simulations suggests that there are
two major mechanisms by which outflows affect dwarf formation. Firstly, the
formation of an outflow slows down the further accretion of gas onto a galaxy,
causing an overall decrease of approximately 50% in the total gas mass accreted
by the objects in our simulations. Additionally, our simulations uncover a
significant population of approximately 10^9 solar mass objects whose formation
is suppressed by the mechanism of ``baryonic stripping,'' in which outflows
from early galaxies strip the gas out of nearby overdense regions that would
have otherwise later formed into dwarf galaxies. This mechanism may be
important in explaining the observed discrepancy between the number of dwarf
galaxies predicted and observed in the local group and provide a natural
explanation for the formation of empty halos which may be required by the
existence of the extremely gas-poor extra-galactic High-Velocity Clouds.

and two diffuse interstellar bands put constraints on the interstellar
reddening which is estimated to be E(B-V)=0.85\pm0.3. The available visual and

distortion, which determines a change of the surface symmetry. As further

top-pion penguins dominate the new physics corrections, and both new gluonic
and electroweak penguins contribute effectively to most decay modes. For
tree-dominated decay modes $B \to \pi \pi, \rho \pi, etc,$ the new physics
corrections are less than 10%. For decays $B \to K^{(*)} \pi$, $K^{(*)} \eta$,
$etc$, the new physics enhancements can be rather large (from $- 70%$ to $\sim
200%$) and are insensitive to the variations of $N_c^{eff}$, $k^2$, $\eta$ and
$m_{\tilde{\pi}}$ within the reasonable ranges. For decays $B^0 \to \phi \pi$,
$\phi \eta^{(')}$, $K^* \bar{K}^0$ and $\rho^+ K^0$, $\delta {\cal B}$ is
strongly $N_c^{eff}-$dependent: varying from -90% to $\sim 1680%$ in the range
of $N_c^{eff}=2-\infty$. The new physics corrections to the CP-violating
asymmetries ${\cal A}_{CP}$ vary greatly for different B decay channels. For
five measured CP asymmetries of $B \to K \pi, K \eta', \omega \pi$ decays,
$\delta {\cal A}_{CP}$ is only about 20% and will be masked by large
theoretical uncertainties. The new physics enhancements to interesting $B \to K
\eta'$ decays are significant in size ($\sim 50%$), insensitive to the
variations of input parameters and hence lead to a plausible interpretation for
the unexpectedly large $B \to K \eta'$ decay rates. The TC2 model predictions
for branching ratios and CP-violating asymmteries of all fifty seven $B \to PP,

scale of extra dimensions of $\sim$ 3 TeV, and thus the observation of such
dimensions lies beyond the reach of accelerators in the near future. The
correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from extra dimensions
is discussed and one finds that with the current limit on the scale of extra
dimensions from the Fermi constant, the correction to $g_{\mu}-2$ does not
compete with the potentially large contributions from the supersymmetric
electro-weak correction. The possibility of generating Kaluza-Klein excitations
associated with large radius compactifications at the LHC is discussed. It is
shown that if such excitations are indeed produced their resonance structure
will encode information on the number of compactified dimensions as well as on
the nature of the specific orbifold compactification. A brief discussion of
difficulties such as rapid proton decay that one encounters in theories with

hierarchy through quantum fluctuations of a single D3 brane, which represents
our world embedded in a bulk five-dimensional space time. In this scenario, the
quantum fluctuations of the D3-brane world in the bulk direction, quantified to
leading order via a `recoil' world-sheet logarithmic conformal field theory
approach, result in the dynamical appearance of a supersymmetry breaking
(obstruction) scale alpha. This may be naturally taken to be at the TeV range,
in order to provide a solution to the conventional gauge-hierarchy problem. The
bulk spatial direction is characterized by the dynamical appearance of an
horizon located at +- 1/alpha, inside which the positive energy conditions for
the existence of stable matter are satisfied. To ensure the correct value of
the four-dimensional Planck mass, the bulk string scale M_s is naturally found
to lie at an intermediate energy scale of 10^{14} GeV. As an exclusive feature
of the D3-brane quantum fluctuations (`recoil') we find that, for any given
M_5, there is a discrete mass spectrum for four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK)
modes of bulk graviton and/or scalar fields. KK modes with masses 0 <= m <
sqrt{2}alpha << M_s are found to have wavefunctions peaked, and hence
localized, on the D3 brane at z=0.

Einstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet theory. This solitonic brane is delta-function
like, and has the property that gravity is completely localized on the brane.
That is, there are no propagating degrees of freedom in the bulk, while on the
brane we have purely 4-dimensional Einstein gravity. Thus, albeit the classical
background is 5-dimensional, the quantum theory (perturbatively) is
4-dimensional. Our solution can be embedded in the supergravity context, where
we have completely localized supergravity on the corresponding solitonic brane,
which is a BPS object preserving 1/2 of the original supersymmetries. By
including a scalar field, we also construct a smooth domain wall solution,
which in a certain limit reduces to the delta-function-like solitonic brane
solution (this is possible for the latter breaks diffeomorphisms only
spontaneously). We then show that in the smooth domain wall background the only
normalizable mode is the 4-dimensional graviton zero mode, while all the other
(including massive Kaluza-Klein) modes are not even plane-wave normalizable.
Finally, we observe that in compactifications of Type IIB on 5-dimensional
Einstein manifolds other than a 5-sphere the corresponding dual gauge theories
on D3-branes are not conformal in the ultra-violet, and at the quantum level we
expect the Einstein-Hilbert term to be generated in their world-volumes. We
conjecture that in full string theory on Type IIB side this is due to higher
curvature terms, which cannot be ignored in such backgrounds. A stronger
version of this conjecture also states that (at least in some cases) in such
backgrounds D3-branes are solitonic objects with completely localized
(super)gravity in their world-volumes.

probabilities to the different polarization bases during both transmission and
reception, thus reducing the fraction of discarded data.
  A second major ingredient of our scheme is a refined analysis of accepted
data: We divide the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis
employed and estimate an error rate for each subset *separately*.
  We then show that such a refined data analysis guarantees the security of our
scheme against the most general eavesdropping strategy, thus generalizing
  Shor and Preskill's proof of security of BB84 to our new scheme. Up till now,
most proposed proofs of security of single-particle type quantum key

semiclassical approximation we may study the quadratic fluctuations over the
instanton which represents in this context the localised finite-action
solutions of the euclidean equation of motion. The determinants of the
quadratic differential operators are evaluated by means of the zeta-function
method. We write in closed form the eigenfunctions as well as the energy
eigenvalues corresponding to such operators by using the shape-invariance
symmetry. The effect of the multi-instantons configurations is also included in
this approach.
