bulge-to-disk size and luminosity ratios, and other quantitative measurements
for the prominence of the bulge are derived. The bulge and disk parameters have
been estimated using a seeing convolved Sersic r^(1/n) bulge and a seeing
convolved exponential disk. In general, early-type spiral galaxy bulges have
Sersic values of n>1, and late-type spiral galaxy bulges have values of n<1. In
the B-band, only 8 galaxies have a bulge shape parameter n consistent with the
exponential value of 1, and only 5 galaxies do in the K-band. Application of
the r^(1/n) bulge models results in a larger mean r_e/h ratio for the
early-type spiral galaxies than the late-type spiral galaxies. Although, this
result is shown not to be statistically significant. The mean B/D luminosity
ratio is, however, significantly larger (> 3-sigma) for the early-type spirals
than the late-type spirals. This apparent contradiction with the r_e/h values
can be explained with an iceberg-like scenario, in which the bulges in
late-type spiral galaxies are relatively submerged in their disk. This can be
achieved by varying the relative bulge/disk stellar density while maintaining
the same effective bulge-to-disk size ratio.
  The absolute bulge magnitude - log(n) diagram is used as a diagnostic tool
for comparative studies with dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies.
At least in the B-band, these objects occupy distinctly different regions of
this parameter space. While the dwarf ellipticals appear to be the faint
extension to the brighter elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral galaxies
are not.

prograde and near-parabolic orbit perturber of mass approximately 0.5 Solar

physically associated with Beta Pic prior to the encounter. Thus we also
consider the possibility that the perturber could be bound to Beta Pic: a
consideration also of general interest where dust discs are known to exist in
binary star systems. In some of our models, we can relate groupings of
perturbed particles to the large-scale structure of the Beta Pic disc. The
groupings correspond to: high eccentricity and inclination particles that reach
apocentre and maximum height in the southwest, moderately eccentric and low
inclination particles that reach apocentre in the northeast, and relatively
unperturbed particles inside approximately 200au radius.

interaction between the stellar field and the accreting matter can have a
strong effect on the disk structure, the transfer of mass and angular momentum
between the disk and the star, and the production of bipolar outflows, e.g.,
plasma jets. We study a key element of this interaction - the time evolution of
the magnetic field configuration brought about by the relative rotation between
the disk and the star - using simplified, largely semianalytic, models. We
first discuss the rapid inflation and opening up of the magnetic field lines in
the corona above the accretion disk, which is caused by the differential
rotation twisting. Then we consider additional physical effects that tend to
limit this expansion, such as the effect of plasma inertia and the possibility
of reconnection in the disk's corona, the latter possibly leading to repeated
cycles in the evolution. We also derive the condition for the existence of a
steady state for a resistive disk and conclude that a steady state
configuration is not realistically possible. Finally, we generalize our
analysis of the opening of magnetic field lines by using a non-self-similar
numerical model that applies to an arbitrarily rotating (e.g. keplerian) disk.

distributions, the Halpha line profiles, and the trigonometric parallax
measurements are combined and compared to model atmosphere calculations to
determine the effective temperature and the radius of each object, and also to
constrain the atmospheric composition. New evolutionary sequences with C/O
cores with thin and thick hydrogen layers are used to derive masses and ages.
We confirm the existence of a range in Teff between 5000 and 6000K where almost
all white dwarfs have H-rich atmospheres. There is little evidence for mixed
H/He dwarfs, with the exception of 2 He-rich DA stars, and 5 C2H white dwarfs
which possibly have mixed H/He/C atmospheres. The DQ sequence terminates near
6500K, below which they are believed to turn into C2H stars. True DC stars
slightly above this temperature are found to exhibit H-like energy
distributions despite the lack of Halpha absorption. Attempts to interpret the
chemical evolution show the problem to be complex. Convective mixing is
necessary to account for the non-DA to DA ratio as a function of temperature.
The presence of helium in cool DA stars, the existence of the non-DA gap, and
the peculiar DC stars are also explained in terms of convective mixing,
although our understanding of how this mechanism works needs to be revised. The
oldest object in our sample is about 7.9 Gyr or 9.7 Gyr old depending on

the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The excellent spatial resolution, very low
background, and brightness of the IR fluctuations yielded the most distant SBF
measurements to date. Twelve nearby galaxies were also observed and used to
calibrate the F160W (1.6 micron) SBF distance scale. Of these, three have
Cepheid variable star distances measured with HST and eleven have optical
I-band SBF distance measurements. A distance modulus of 18.5 mag to the Large
Magellanic Cloud was adopted for this calibration. We present the F160W SBF
Hubble diagram and find a Hubble constant Ho=76 +/- 1.3 (1-sigma statistical)
+/- 6 (systematic) km/s/Mpc. This result is insensitive to the velocity model
used to correct for local bulk motions. Restricting the fit to the six most
distant galaxies yields the smallest value of Ho=72 +/- 2.3 km/s/Mpc consistent
with the data. This 6% decrease in the Hubble constant is consistent with the
hypothesis that the Local Group inhabits an under-dense region of the universe,
but is also consistent with the best-fit value of Ho=76 km/s/Mpc at the
1.5-sigma level.

largely insensitive to both the real-space description of the atomic basis
orbitals and different ways of optimizing the tight-binding parameters.
Tight-binding parameters that are optimized to give the best effective masses
significantly improve the energies of the excitonic states due to the better
single-particle energies. However, the Coulomb interaction does not vary much
between different parameterizations. In addition, the sensitivity of the
Coulomb interaction to the choice of atomic or bitals decreases with increasing
dot size. Quantitatively, tight-binding treatments of correlation effects are
reliable for dots with radii larger than 15--20 angstrom. The calculated
excitonic gaps are in good agreement with recent photoluminescence data for Si

long-ranged, extending over the whole dot when there is no local (onsite)
orthogonality between the electron and hole wave functions. By contrast, for Si

temperature T$_c$ only in the next-to-leading order (i.e., in O(1/N$^2$) of the

they have only little influence on the value of T$_c$ obtained in the leading
order O(1/N) in the optimal and overdoped region, i.e., for dopings larger than
the instability towards a flux phase. This result disagrees with recent
spin-fluctuation mediated pairing theories. The discrepancies can be traced
back to the fact that in our case the coupling between electrons and spins is
determined by the t-J model and not adjusted and that the spin susceptibility
is rather broad and structureless and not strongly peaked at low energies as in
spin-fluctuation models. Relating T$_c$ and transport we show that the
effective interactions in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels are
not simply related within the 1/N expansion by different Fermi surface averages
of the same interactin as in the case of phonons or spin fluctuations. As a
result, we find that large values for T$_c$ and rather small scattering rates
in the normal state as found in the experiments can easily be reconciled with
each other. We also show that correlation effects heavily suppress transport
relaxation rates relative to quasiparticle relaxation rates in the case of

for a class of combinatorial puzzle problems, such as tiling a tray by a fixed

search with reversible local operations on doubly linked lists. By this trick,
every step of the search affects the data incrementally.
  The second trick is to add a ghost square that represents the identity of
each polyomino. Thus puts the rule that each polyomino be used once on the same
footing as the rule that each square be covered once. The coding simplifies to
a more abstract form which is equivalent to 0-1 integer programming. More
significantly for the total computation time, the search can naturally switch
between placing a fixed polyomino or covering a fixed square at different
stages, according to a combined heuristic.
  Finally the author reports excellent performance for his algorithm for some
familiar puzzles. These include tiling a hexagon by 19 hexiamonds and the N

experimentally they are the only color-suppressed modes which have been

emitted meson $J\psi$ is heavy. We analyze the decay $B\to J\psi K$ within the
framework of QCD factorization in the heavy quark limit. We show explicitly the
scale and $\gamma_5$-scheme independence of decay amplitudes and infrared
safety of nonfactorizable corrections at twist-2 order. Leading-twist
contributions from the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the mesons
are too small to accommodate the data; the nonfactorizable corrections to naive
factorization are small and not significant. We study the twist-3 effects due
to the kaon and find that the coefficient $a_2(J\psi K)$ is largely enhanced by
the nonfactorizable spectator interactions arising from the twist-3 kaon LCDA
$\phi^K_\sigma$, which are formally power-suppressed but chirally,
logarithmically and kinematically enhanced. Therefore, factorization breaks
down at twist-3 order. Higher-twist effects of $J\psi$ are briefly discussed.
Our result also resolves the long-standing sign ambiguity of $a_2(J\psi K)$,
which turns out to be positive for its real part.

the parton model, the relativistic quark model for hadrons, and the ``rest of

the notion of the {\em Maslov index} of a semi-Riemannian geodesic, which is a
homological invariant and it substitutes the notion of geometric index in
Riemannian geometry. Under generic circumstances, the Maslov index of a
geodesic is computed as a sort of {\em algebraic count} of the conjugate points
along the geodesic. For non positive definite metrics the index of the index
form is always infinite; in this paper we prove that the space of all
variations of a given geodesic has a {\em natural} splitting into two infinite
dimensional subspaces, and the Maslov index is given by the difference of the
index and the coindex of the restriction of the index form to these subspaces.
In the case of variable endpoints, two suitable correction terms, defined in
terms of the endmanifolds, are added to the equality. Using appropriate change
of variables, the theory is entirely extended to the more general case of {\em
symplectic differential systems}, that can be obtained as linearizations of the

anisotropic components of correlation functions in turbulent systems with
pressure. The anisotropic components are conveniently labeled by the angular
momentum index $\ell$ of the irreducible representation of the SO(3) symmetry
group. Such exponents govern the rate of decay of anisotropy with decreasing
scales. It is a fundamental question whether they ever increase as $\ell$
increases, or they are bounded from above. The equations of motion in systems
with pressure contain nonlocal integrals over all space. One could argue that
the requirement of convergence of these integrals bounds the exponents from
above. It is shown here on the basis of a solvable model (the ``linear pressure
model""), that this is not necessarily the case. The model introduced here is of
a passive vector advection by a rapidly varying velocity field. The advected
vector field is divergent free and the equation contains a pressure term that
maintains this condition. The zero modes of the second-order correlation
function are found in all the sectors of the symmetry group. We show that the
spectrum of scaling exponents can increase with $\ell$ without bounds, while
preserving finite integrals. The conclusion is that contributions from higher
and higher anisotropic sectors can disappear faster and faster upon decreasing
the scales also in systems with pressure.

better realized for neutrons than for protons. This behavior comes from balance
effects amongst the central nuclear potential parameters. In general, we found
an isospin asymmetry of the nuclear pseudo-spin interaction, opposed to the
nuclear spin-orbit interaction which is quasi isospin symmetric.

phase from reflected GPS signals for altimetric purposes and the advantages of
using interferometric combinations of the signals at different

  We focus on the coherence properties of the signals, including the PIP
interferometric combination of phases in the different frequencies. In this
work we will concentrate on a static, 8 m high receiver (at least in regards to
the simulations), and an infinitely removed static source. As the ocean moves,
the received field will pick up a random phase. We want to understand the
behavior of this phase, as the goal is to carry out altimetric measurements
using phase ranging. We will also show that this random phase carries
geophysical information (intuitively, the bigger the significant wave height,
the larger the phase excursions).

a number of semiempirical compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory,

methods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the
reference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very
recently proposed mPW1K functional), the compound methods appear to perform
well. Only the 'half-and-half' functionals BH&HLYP and mPWH&HPW91, and the
empirical mPW1K functional, consistently find all required stationary points;
the other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH&HLYP
and mPWH&HPW91 somewhat overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a lesser
extent, mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1
functionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the
HCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central barriers.
HCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved in
HCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals
considered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound
thermochemistry methods.

Validation calculations on a variety of third-row and fourth-row diatomics
suggest them to be comparable in quality to the all-electron cc-pVTZ and
cc-pVQZ basis sets for lighter elements. Especially the SDB-cc-pVQZ basis set
in conjunction with a core polarization potential (CPP) yields excellent
agreement with experiment for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements.

explicit treatment of 13 valence electrons appears to be desirable, while it
seems inevitable for In compounds. For Ga and Ge, we propose correlation
consistent basis sets extended for (3d) correlation. For accurate calculations
on organometallic complexes of interest to homogenous catalysis, we recommend a
combination of the standard cc-pVTZ basis set for first- and second-row

this approach dimensionless ratios E(rho) / E(sigma) of entanglement measures
may depend on what state is chosen as the basic unit of entanglement. This
observation leads us to suggest three novel approaches to the quantification of
entanglement. These approaches lead to unit-free definitions for the
entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement, and suggest natural
measures of entanglement for multipartite systems. We also show that the
behaviour of one of these novel measures, the entanglement of computation, is
related to some open problems in computational complexity.
