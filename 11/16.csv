correlated with the tilted Gould Belt than with other Galactic structures. As
many as 40 +- 5 sources are statistically associated with the Belt at |b|> 5

excited from the secondary star and accelerates the binary evolution. The
accretion rate is therefore much higher than in an ordinary cataclysmic binary
at the same orbital period, as is the luminosity of the white dwarf primary. In
the steady state, the enhanced luminosity is just sufficient to maintain the
wind from the secondary. The accretion rate and luminosity predicted by the
wind-driven model for T Pyx are in good agreement with the observational
evidence. X-ray observations with Chandra or XMM may be able to confirm T Pyx's
status as a SSS.
  T Pyx's lifetime in the wind-driven state is on the order of a million years.
Its ultimate fate is not certain, but the system may very well end up
destroying itself, either via the complete evaporation of the secondary star,

the companion's wind. The spectra and light curves for the inverse Compton
emission from the shock-terminated wind are compared with those for an

decreasing the asymmetry of the gamma-ray light curve around periastron, which
arises because of the asymmetrical variation of the scattering angle.

outside-in outbursts occur for mass transfer rates lower than in the standard
model as required by observations; (2) the presence of long (wide) and short
(narrow) outbursts with similar peak luminosities is a natural property of the
model. Mass-transfer fluctuations by factors ~ 2 can explain the occurrence of
both long and short outbursts above the cataclysmic variable period gap,
whereas below 2 hr only short normal outbursts are expected (in addition to
superoutbursts which are not dealt with in this article). With additional
heating by the stream and tidal torques, such fluctuations can also explain the
occurrence of both outside-in and inside-out outbursts in SS Cyg and similar
systems. The occurrence of outside-in outbursts in short orbital-period, low
mass-transfer-rate systems requires the disc to be much smaller than the
tidal-truncation radius. In this case the recurrence time of both inside-out

Energy Cosmic Rays in the framework of Top-Down models. We show that, for high
energy of decays and in a wide range of spectra of injected protons, their
extragalactic flux is consistent with the observed fluxes of cosmic rays in the
energy range 0.1 E_{GZK}< E < 10E_{GZK}. For suitable energy and spectra of
injected protons, the contribution of galactic sources is moderate, in this
energy range, but it dominates at smaller and larger energies. In such models
we can expect that at these energies the anisotropy of cosmic rays distribution
over sky will be especially small.
  Some possible manifestations of decays of super massive particles such as,
for example, primordial black holes with masses M_{pbh} ~ 10^{-5} g, are
considered. In particular, we show that partial conversion of energy released
during these decays at redshifts z ~ 1000 to Ly-alpha photons can delay the
hydrogen recombination and distort the spectrum of fluctuations of the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

  It has also been suggested that the problem of non-singular galactic halos
might be explained if dark matter originates non-thermally from the decay of
particles, Y, such that there is a free-streaming length of the order of
0.1Mpc. Here we explore the possibility that quantum fluctuations might account
for the Y particles as well as the X particles. For the case of non-thermal
WIMP dark matter with unsuppressed weak interactions we find that there is a
general problem with deuterium photo-dissociation, disfavouring WIMP dark
matter candidates. For the case of more general dark matter particles, which
may have little or no interaction with conventional matter, we discuss the
conditions under which X and Y scalars or fermions can account for non-thermal
dark matter and cosmic rays. For the case where X and Y scalars are
simultaneously produced, we show that galactic halos are likely to have a
dynamically significant component of X scalar cold dark matter in addition to
the dominant non-thermal dark matter component.

curvature or, equivalently, its Yamabe invariant is non-negative. We show that
F-structures of rank zero appear rather frequently:every compact complex
elliptic surface admits one as well as any simply connected 5-manifold. We use
these results to study the minimal entropy problem. We show the following two
theorems: suppose M is obtained by taking connected sums of copies of CP^2
(with any orintation), S^2 \times S^2 and the K3 surface. Then M has zero
minimal entropy. Moreover, M admits a metric with zero topological entropy if
and only if M is diffeomorphic to S^4, CP^2, S^2 \times S^2, CP^2#CP^2 or

nuclear systems. It turns out that the $^3$H-$^3$He binding energy difference
is essentially ruled by $\Delta a_{CSB}$ and not very sensitive to CSB from $P$
waves. However, the Coulomb displacement energies (which are the subject of the
Nolen-Schiffer anomaly) receive about 50% of their CSB contribution from $NN$
partial waves beyond $^1S_0$. Consequently, the predictions by the various CSB
models differ here substantially (10-20%). Unfortunately, the evaluation of the
leading Coulomb contributions carry a large uncertainty such that no
discrimination between the competing CSB models can presently be made. To
decide the issue we suggest to look into nuclear few-body reactions that are

  systems","12 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1088/0305-4470/34/35/318",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate optimal separable approximations (decompositions) of states
rho of bipartite quantum systems A and B of arbitrary dimensions MxN following
the lines of Ref. [M. Lewenstein and A. Sanpera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2261
(1998)]. Such approximations allow to represent in an optimal way any density
operator as a sum of a separable state and an entangled state of a certain
form. For two qubit systems (M=N=2) the best separable approximation has a form
of a mixture of a separable state and a projector onto a pure entangled state.
We formulate a necessary condition that the pure state in the best separable
approximation is not maximally entangled. We demonstrate that the weight of the
entangled state in the best separable approximation in arbitrary dimensions
provides a good entanglement measure. We prove in general for arbitrary M and N
that the best separable approximation corresponds to a mixture of a separable
and an entangled state which are both unique. We develop also a theory of
optimal separable approximations for states with positive partial transpose
(PPT states). Such approximations allow to decompose any density operator with
positive partial transpose as a sum of a separable state and an entangled PPT
state. We discuss procedures of constructing such decompositions.

commitment given by Mayers, Lo, and Chau from the viewpoint of quantum
information theory. It is shown that there is a trade-off relation between
information acquired by Bob during the commitment phase and the ability to
change a commit bit by Alice during the opening phase. It is clarified that a
protocol that is unbiased to both Alice and Bob cannot be, at the same time,
secure against both parties. Fundamental physical constraints that govern this
no-go theorem are also discussed.

A 63, 034301 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevA.63.034301",,"quant-ph",,"  The quantum channel subject to local interaction with two-level environment
is studied. The two-level environment is regarded as a quantum bit (qubit) as
well as a pair of particles owned by Alice and Bob. The amount of entanglement
initially shared by Alice and Bob is distributed among these three qubits due
to the interaction. In this model, we show that the singlet fraction of the
decohered quantum channel is uniquely determined by the distributed
entanglement. When the decohered quantum channel is used under the standard
teleportation scheme, the optimal teleportation fidelity is well understood by
considering the remaining entanglement between environment and transmitted
state.

quantum source coding theorem, arbitrarily long strings of signals may be
encoded asymptotically into S qubits/signal (the Schumacher limit) in such a
way that entire strings may be recovered with arbitrarily high fidelity.
Suppose that classical storage is free while quantum storage is expensive and
suppose that the states of E do not fall into two or more orthogonal subspaces.
We show that if E can be compressed with arbitrarily high fidelity into A
qubits/signal plus any amount of auxiliary classical storage then A must still
be at least as large as the Schumacher limit S of E. Thus no part of the
quantum information content of E can be faithfully replaced by classical
information. If the states do fall into orthogonal subspaces then A may be less
than S, but only by an amount not exceeding the amount of classical information
specifying the subspace for a signal from the source.
