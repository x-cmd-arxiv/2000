remain. Notable is also that the sensitivity of the stellar luminosity function

structure grew via gravitational infall from primordial adiabatic
perturbations. Both of these observations seem to indicate that we are on the
right track with inflation. But what is the new physics responsible for
inflation? This question can be answered with observations of the polarization
of the CMB. Inflation predicts robustly the existence of a stochastic
background of cosmological gravitational waves with an amplitude proportional
to the square of the energy scale of inflation. This gravitational-wave
background induces a unique signature in the polarization of the CMB. If
inflation took place at an energy scale much smaller than that of grand
unification, then the signal will be too small to be detectable. However, if
inflation had something to do with grand unification or Planck-scale physics,
then the signal is conceivably detectable in the optimistic case by the Planck
satellite, or if not, then by a dedicated post-Planck CMB polarization
experiment. Realistic developments in detector technology as well as a proper
scan strategy could produce such a post-Planck experiment that would improve on
Planck's sensitivity to the gravitational-wave background by several orders of
magnitude in a decade timescale.

luminosities approximately equal to present-day L*, with a range from 0.2 L* to
about 4 L*. These host galaxies have magnitudes and sizes consistent with those
of the Lyman break galaxies at similar redshifts and at similar rest
wavelengths, but are about two magnitudes fainter than high-z powerful radio
galaxies. The hosts of our high-z sample are comparable to or less luminous
than the hosts of the low-z RQQs with similar nuclear absolute magnitudes.
However, the high z galaxies are more compact than the hosts of the low z
quasars, and probably have only 10 - 20% of the stellar mass of their low-z

indicate that they contain black holes with masses around 10^8 Msolar.
Comparison to their nuclear magnitudes implies accretion rates that are near or
at the Eddington limit. Although these high z hosts already contain
supermassive black holes, the galaxies will need to grow significantly to
evolve into present-day L* galaxies. These results are basically consistent
with theoretical predictions for the hierarchical buildup of the galaxy host

the first week the spectra are characterised by prominent broad emission lines
with narrow peaks superimposed on a very blue continuum(T~24000K). In the
following two weeks broad, blueshifted absorption components appeared in the
spectra and the temperature dropped. By day 44, broad emission components in H
and He reappeared in the spectra. These persisted to 100-130d, becoming
increasingly asymmetric. We agree with Leonard et al. (2000) that the broad
emission lines indicate interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar
material (CSM) and deduce that progenitor of SN 1998S appears to have gone
through at least two phases of mass loss, giving rise to two CSM zones.
Examination of the spectra indicates that the inner zone extended to <90AU,
while the outer CSM extended from 185AU to over 1800AU. Analysis of high
resolution spectra shows that the outer CSM had a velocity of 40-50 km/s.
Assuming a constant velocity, we can infer that the outer CSM wind commenced
more than 170 years ago, and ceased about 20 years ago, while the inner CSM
wind may have commenced less than 9 years ago. During the era of the outer CSM
wind the outflow was high, >2x10^{-5}M_{\odot}/yr corresponding to a mass loss
of at least 0.003M_{\odot} and suggesting a massive progenitor. We also model
the CO emission observed in SN 1998S. We deduce a CO mass of ~10^{-3} M_{\odot}
moving at ~2200km/s, and infer a mixed metal/He core of ~4M_{\odot}, again

model which explains these states as transient excitonic states in metals. The
physical background of transient excitons is the finite time a system needs to
react to an external perturbation, in other words, the time which is needed to
build up a polarization cloud. This process can be probed with modern
ultra-short laser pulses. We calculate the time-dependent density-response
function within the jellium model and for real Cu. From this knowledge it is
possible within linear response theory to calculate the time needed to screen a
positive charge distribution and -- on top of this -- to determine excitonic
binding energies. Our results lead to the interpretation of the experimentally
detected states as transient excitonic states.

the constraint on each lattice site are promoted to time-dependent fields.
Consequently, only the amplitude (radial part) of the slave boson fields
survives. It has the special property that it is equal to its square in the
physical subspace. This renders the functional integral for the radial field
Gaussian, even when non-local Coulomb-type interactions are included. We
propose i) a continuum integral representation for the set-up of further
approximation schemes, and ii) a discrete representation with an Ising-like
radial variable, valid for long-ranged interactions as well. The latter scheme
can be taken as a starting point for numerical evaluations.

using methodologies from theoretical computer science. We are especially
concerned with situations where an adversary bidder knows the bidding
algorithms of all the other bidders. In the two-bidder case, we derive an
optimal randomized bidding algorithm, by which the disadvantaged bidder can
procure at least half of the auction objects despite the adversary's a priori
knowledge of his algorithm. In the general $k$-bidder case, if the number of
objects is a multiple of $k$, an optimal randomized bidding algorithm is found.
If the $k-1$ disadvantaged bidders employ that same algorithm, each of them can
obtain at least $1/k$ of the objects regardless of the bidding algorithm the
adversary uses. These two algorithms are based on closed-form solutions to
certain multivariate probability distributions. In situations where a
closed-form solution cannot be obtained, we study a restricted class of bidding
algorithms as an approximation to desired optimal algorithms.

the main ideas to optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse
results of previously answered queries. This leads to the problem of rewriting
aggregate queries using views. Due to a lack of theory, algorithms for this
problem were rather ad-hoc. They were sound, but were not proven to be
complete.
  Recently we have given syntactic characterizations for the equivalence of
aggregate queries and applied them to decide when there exist rewritings.
However, these decision procedures do not lend themselves immediately to an
implementation. In this paper, we present practical algorithms for rewriting
queries with $\COUNT$ and $\SUM$. Our algorithms are sound. They are also
complete for important cases. Our techniques can be used to improve well-known
procedures for rewriting non-aggregate queries. These procedures can then be
adapted to obtain algorithms for rewriting queries with $\MIN$ and $\MAX$. The
algorithms presented are a basis for realizing optimizers that rewrite queries
using views.

essence of the approach is that we make use of general term-orderings (instead
of level mappings), like it is done in transformational approaches to logic
program termination analysis, but that we apply these orderings directly to the
logic program and not to the term-rewrite system obtained through some
transformation. We define some variants of acceptability, based on general
term-orderings, and show how they are equivalent to LD-termination. We develop
a demand driven, constraint-based approach to verify these
acceptability-variants.
  The advantage of the approach over standard acceptability is that in some
cases, where complex level mappings are needed, fairly simple term-orderings
may be easily generated. The advantage over transformational approaches is that
it avoids the transformation step all together.

structure of the GN model in this approximation has the property that there is
a tricritical point at a fixed temperature and chemical potential separating
regions where the chiral transition is first order from that where it is second
order. We consider evolutions starting in local thermal and chemical
equilibrium in the massless unbroken phase for conditions pertaining to
traversing a first or second order phase transition. We assume boost invariant
kinematics and determine the evolution of the order parameter $\sigma$, the
energy density and pressure as well as the effective temperature, chemical
potential and interpolating number densities as a function of the proper time
$\tau$. We find that before the phase transition, the system behaves as if it
were an ideal fluid in local thermal equilibrium with equation of state
$p=\epsilon$. After the phase transition, the system quickly reaches its true
broken symmetry vacuum value for the fermion mass and for the energy density.

far out of equilibrium as soon as the plasma traverses the chiral phase
transition. We have also determined the spatial dependence of the ""pion""

associate a new multi-parameter deformation, H_k, of the smash product of G
with the polynomial algebra on V. The algebra H_k, called a symplectic
reflection algebra, is related to the coordinate ring of a universal Poisson
deformation of the quotient singularity V/G. If G is the Weyl group of a root
system in a vector space h and V=h\oplus h^*, then the algebras H_k are
`rational' degenerations of Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebra.
  Let G=S_n, the Weyl group of g=gl_n. We construct a 1-parameter deformation
of the Harish-Chandra homomorphism from D(g)^g, the algebra of invariant
polynomial differential operators on gl_n, to the algebra of S_n-invariant
differential operators with rational coefficients on C^n. The second order
Laplacian on g goes, under the deformed homomorphism, to the Calogero-Moser
differential operator with rational potential. Our crucial idea is to
reinterpret the deformed homomorphism as a homomorphism: D(g)^g \to {spherical
subalgebra in H_k}, where H_k is the symplectic reflection algebra associated
to S_n. This way, the deformed Harish-Chandra homomorphism becomes nothing but
a description of the spherical subalgebra in terms of `quantum' Hamiltonian
reduction.
  In the classical limit k -> \infty, our construction gives an isomorphism
between the spherical subalgebra in H_\infty and the coordinate ring of the
Calogero-Moser space. We prove that all simple H_\infty-modules have dimension
n!, and are parametrised by points of the Calogero-Moser space. The algebra
H_\infty is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a distinguished rank n!

new insight into the statistical properties of the spectra. We analyse
numerically the correlations in level sequences at high level numbers (>10^5)
for several examples of right triangle billiards. We find that the strength of
the correlations is closely related to the genus of the invariant surface of
the classical billiard flow. Surprisingly, the genus plays and important role
on the quantum level also. Based on this observation a mechanism is discussed,
which may explain the particular quantum-classical correspondence in right
triangle billiards. Though this class of systems is rather small, it contains
examples for integrable, pseudo integrable, and non integrable (ergodic,
mixing) dynamics, so that the results might be relevant in a more general
context.

mechanism. Since the perturbation due to the electric field of the nucleus is
exactly known, firm conclusions can be drawn from such measurements.
Electromagnetic matrix elements and astrophysical S-factors for radiative
capture processes can be extracted from experiments. We describe the basic
theory, new results concerning higher order effects in the dissociation of
neutron halo nuclei, and briefly review the experimental results obtained up to
now. Some new applications of Coulomb dissociation for nuclear astrophysics and
nuclear structure physics are discussed.

  off-diagonal density array","14 pages. Replaces physics/0011039",,,,"physics.atom-ph physics.chem-ph",,"  Early work extending the Kohn-Sham theory to excited states utilized an
ensemble average of the Hamiltonian considered as a functional of the
corresponding average density. We propose and develop an alternative that
utilizes the matrix elements of the density operator taken between any two
states of the included space. The new theory is also based on a variational
principle for the trace of the Hamiltonian over a selected space of states
viewed, however, as a functional of the associated array of matrix elements of
the density. It leads to a matrix generalization of Kohn-Sham theory. To
illustrate the formalism, we study a suitably defined weak-coupling limit and
derive from it an eigenvalue equation that has the form of the random phase
approximation. The result can be identified with a similar equation derived
directly from the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation that has been applied
recently with considerable success to molecular excitations. We prove, within
the defined approximations, that the eigenvalues can be interpreted as true
excitation energies.

2 cloning machine, and establish a correspondence between these measurements at
the output and effective measurements on the original input. We show that one
can implement sharp effective measurement elements by measuring only two out of
the three output systems. Additionally, certain complete sets of sharp
measurements on the input can be realised by measurements on the two clones.
Furthermore, we introduce a scheme that allows to restore the original input in
one of the output bits, by using measurements and classical communication -- a
protocol that resembles teleportation.

  trajectory treatment","Changed content, Added references and Corrected typos",,"10.1016/S0301-0104(01)00304-4",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum feedback can stabilize a two-level atom against decoherence
(spontaneous emission), putting it into an arbitrary (specified) pure state.
This requires perfect homodyne detection of the atomic emission, and
instantaneous feedback. Inefficient detection was considered previously by two
of us. Here we allow for a non-zero delay time $\tau$ in the feedback circuit.
Because a two-level atom is a nonlinear optical system, an analytical solution
is not possible. However, quantum trajectories allow a simple numerical
simulation of the resulting non-Markovian process. We find the effect of the
time delay to be qualitatively similar to that of inefficient detection. The
solution of the non-Markovian quantum trajectory will not remain fixed, so that
the time-averaged state will be mixed, not pure. In the case where one tries to
stabilize the atom in the excited state, an approximate analytical solution to
the quantum trajectory is possible. The result, that the purity ($P=2{\rm
Tr}[\rho^{2}]-1$) of the average state is given by $P=1-4\gamma\tau$ (where
$\gamma$ is the spontaneous emission rate) is found to agree very well with the
numerical results.
