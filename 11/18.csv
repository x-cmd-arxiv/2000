RXJ0925.7-4758 with the X-ray CCD cameras (Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer;
SIS) on-board the ASCA satellite. We have applied theoretical spectral models
to CAL87, and constrained the white dwarf mass and intrinsic luminosity as 0.8
- 1.2 M_solar and 4 x 10^{37}- 1.2 x 10^{38} erg s^{-1}, respectively. However,
we have found the observed luminosity is an order of magnitude smaller than the
theoretical estimate, which indicates the white dwarf is permanently blocked by
the accretion disk, and we are observing a scattering emission by a fully
ionized accretion disk corona (ADC) whose column density is ~ 1.5 x 10^{23}
cm^{-2}. Through simulation, we have shown that the orbital eclipse can be
explained by the ADC model, such that a part of the extended X-ray emission
from the ADC is blocked by the companion star filling its Roche lobe. We have
found that very high surface gravity and temperature, ~ 10^{10} cm s^{-2} and ~
100 eV respectively, as well as a strong absorption edge at ~ 1.02 keV, are
required to explain the X-ray energy spectrum of RXJ0925.7-4758. These values
are only possible for an extremely heavy white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar
limit. Although the super soft source luminosity should be ~ 10^{38} erg s^{-1}
at the Chandrasekhar limit, the observed luminosity of RXJ0925.7-4758 is nearly
two orders of magnitude smaller even assuming an extreme distance of ~10 kpc.
To explain the luminosity discrepancy, we propose a model that very thick
matter which was previously ejected from the system, as a form of jets,
intervenes the line of sight, and reduces the luminosity significantly due to
Thomson scattering.

free space, which is characterized by self-similarity. Reconnection triggered
by locally enhanced resistivity assumed at the center of the current sheet can
self-similarly and unlimitedly evolve until external factors affect the
evolution. The possibility and stability of this type of evolution are verified
by numerical simulations in a very wide spatial dynamic range. Actual
astrophysical reconnection in solar flares and geomagnetospheric substorms can
be treated as an evolutionary process in free space, because the resultant
scale is much larger than the initial scale. In spite of this fact, most of the
previous numerical works focused on the evolutionary characters strongly
affected by artificial boundary conditions on the simulation boundary. Our new
model clarifies a realistic evolution for such cases. The characteristic
structure around the diffusion region is quite similar to the Petschek model
which is characterized by a pair of slow-mode shocks and the fast-mode
rarefaction-dominated inflow. However, in the outer region, a vortex-like
return flow driven by the fast-mode compression caused by the piston effect of
the plasmoid takes place. The entire reconnection system expands

proximity-induced superconductors and ballistic and diffusive one-dimensional
metals. Here we report that electrically-contacted single-wall nanotubes can
serve as powerful probes of Kondo physics, demonstrating the universality of
the Kondo effect. Arising in the prototypical case from the interaction between
a localized impurity magnetic moment and delocalized electrons in a metallic
host, the Kondo effect has been used to explain enhanced low-temperature
scattering from magnetic impurities in metals, and also occurs in transport
through semiconductor quantum dots. The far higher tunability of dots (in our
case, nanotubes) compared with atomic impurities renders new classes of
Kondo-like effects accessible. Our nanotube devices differ from previous
systems in which Kondo effects have been observed, in that they are
one-dimensional quantum dots with three-dimensional metal (gold) reservoirs.
This allows us to observe Kondo resonances for very large electron number (N)
in the dot, and approaching the unitary limit (where the transmission reaches
its maximum possible value). Moreover, we detect a previously unobserved Kondo
effect, occurring for even values of N in a magnetic field.

flow, the domains have on average an elliptic shape. The time evolution of the

to lower the density of small eigenvalues for $H^2$ as compared to the Wilson
gauge action. This makes the calculation feasible on 64 nodes of CRAY-T3E. Also
presented is the pion mass on a small volume ($6^3 \times 12$ with a Wilson

equilibrium. We elucidate the phase diagram near the critical temperature in
the space of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic potential terms of
fourth order in the pairing gap. Within the color and flavor antisymmetric
channel with zero total angular momentum, the phase diagram contains an
isoscalar (IS) color-antitriplet phase and a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase,
reached by a second order transition from the normal state, as well as states
reached by a first order transition. We complement the general Ginzburg-Landau
approach by deriving the high-density asymptotic form of the Ginzburg-Landau
free energy from the weak-coupling gap equation. The dynamically-screened,
long-range color magnetic interactions are taken into account in solving the
gap equation. We find that in the limit of weak coupling, the IS phase is less
favorable near the transition temperature than the CFL phase. In view of the
fact that deconfined quark matter must be color charge neutral, we incorporate
the constraint of overall color neutrality into the Ginzburg-Landau theory and
the gap equation. This constraint yields a disparity in the chemical potential
between colors and reduces the size of the gap, in the presence of the
anisotropy of the order parameters in color space. In comparison with the case
in which there are no chemical potential differences between colors and hence
the superfluid generally has nonzero net color charge, we find that while the
constraint of color neutrality has only negligible effects on the gap in the
weak coupling regime, it appreciably destabilizes the IS phase in the strong
coupling regime without affecting the CFL phase.

that lie close and possible below the threshold for pion decay, and therefore
describe dibaryons. The quantum corrections stabilize these solutions, the mass
density of which have the correct exponential fall off at large distances.

important 7-Li(p,n_0) and 7-Li(p,n_1) reactions are evaluated from the
experimental data, with their angular distributions represented using Lengendre
polynomial expansions. The decay of the remaining reaction flux is estimated
from GNASH nuclear model calculations. The evaluated ENDF-data are described in
detail, and illustrated in numerous figures. We also illustrate the use of
these data in a representative application by a radiation transport simulation
with the code MCNPX.

field theory which dramatically simplifies computations. This redundancy is
best exploited by using dibaryon fields as fundamental degrees of freedom. In
turn, this suggests a new power counting scheme which sums range corrections to
all orders. We explore this method with a few simple observables: the deuteron
charge form factor, n p -> d gamma, and Compton scattering from the deuteron.
Higher dimension operators involving electroweak gauge fields are not
renormalized by the s-wave strong interactions, and therefore do not scale with
inverse powers of the renormalization scale. Thus, naive dimensional analysis
of these operators is sufficient to estimate their contribution to a given
process.

four dimensional gravitational conformal anomaly and the fine structure
constant; the role of Noncommutative Geometry, Negative Probabilities and
Cantorian-Fractal spacetime in the Young's two-slit experiment. We then
generalize the recent construction of the Quenched-Minisuperspace bosonic
$p$-brane propagator in $D$ dimensions ($AACS$ [18]) to the full
multidimensional case involving all $p$-branes : the construction of the
Multidimensional-Particle propagator in Clifford spaces ($C$-spaces) associated
with a nested family of $p$-loop histories living in a target $D$-dim
background spacetime . We show how the effective $C$-space geometry is related
to $extrinsic$ curvature of ordinary spacetime. The motion of rigid
particles/branes is studied to explain the natural $emergence$ of classical
spin. The relation among $C$-space geometry and ${\cal W}$, Finsler Geometry
and (Braided) Quantum Groups is discussed. Some final remarks about the
Riemannian long distance limit of $C$-space geometry are made.

It is intended to stimulate further research and interest in the topic while
also presenting a few original thoughts on certain aspects of the subject. In
particular, the paper focuses on the development of Euclidean geometry, the
intense study of the parallel axiom in the 1800's, the development of time as a
dimension leading to Kaluza-Klein theory, and finally the explosion of work in
the combined areas of string theory, M-theory, and F-theory in the past 30
years.

nonlinear maps a phase space representation is mapped to another phase space
representation thereby extending the standard concept of covariance. This
extended covariance allows Dirac-Jordan transformation theory to naturally
emerge from the Hilbert space representations in the Weyl quantization.
