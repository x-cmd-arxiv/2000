the planetary nebula IC 4846, which reveal, for the first time, its complex
structure and the existence of collimated outflows. The object consists of a
moderately elongated shell, two (and probably three) pairs of collimated
bipolar outflows at different orientations, and an attached circular shell. One
of the collimated pairs is constituted by two curved, extended filaments whose
properties indicate a high velocity, bipolar precessing jet. A difference of
\~10 km/s is found between the systemic velocity of the precessing jets and the
centroid velocity of the nebula, as recently report for Hu 2-1. We propose that
this difference is due to orbital motion of the ejection source in a binary
central star. The orbital separation and period estimates for the binary star
are less than or equal to 30 AU and 100 yr, respectively. These are similar to
those previously estimated for Hu 2-1, linking the central stars of both
planetary nebulae to interacting binaries. Extraordinary similarities also
exist between IC 4846 and the bewildering planetary nebula NGC 6543, suggesting
a similar formation history for both objects.

a fluid is cooled or compressed in such a fashion that it does not crystallise.
Almost all types of materials are capable of glass formation -- polymers, metal
alloys, and molten salts, to name a few. Given such diversity, organising
principles which systematise data concerning glass formation are invaluable.
One such principle is the classification of glass formers according to their
fragility\cite{fragility}. Fragility measures the rapidity with which a
liquid's properties such as viscosity change as the glassy state is approached.
Although the relationship between features of the energy landscape of a glass
former, its configurational entropy and fragility have been analysed previously
(e. g.,\cite{speedyfr}), an understanding of the origins of fragility in these
features is far from being well established. Results for a model liquid, whose
fragility depends on its bulk density, are presented in this letter. Analysis
of the relationship between fragility and quantitative measures of the energy
landscape (the complicated dependence of energy on configuration) reveal that
the fragility depends on changes in the vibrational properties of individual
energy basins, in addition to the total number of such basins present, and
their spread in energy. A thermodynamic expression for fragility is derived,
which is in quantitative agreement with {\it kinetic} fragilities obtained from
the liquid's diffusivity.

principles of controlling (""engineering"") the reservoir spectrum and the
spectral broadening incurred by repeated measurements. This control can yield
either the inhibition (Zeno effect) or the acceleration (anti-Zeno effect) of
the quasi-exponential decay of the observed state by means of frequent
measurements. In the discussed scheme, a photon is bouncing back and forth
between two perfect mirrors, each time passing a polarization rotator. The
horizontal and vertical polarizations can be viewed as analogs of an excited
and a ground state of a two level system (TLS). A polarization beam splitter
and an absorber for the vertically polarized photon are inserted between the
mirrors, and effect measurements of the polarization. The polarization angle
acquired in the electrooptic polarization rotator can fluctuate randomly, e.g.,
via noisy modulation. In the absence of an absorber the polarization
randomization corresponds to TLS decay into an infinite-temperature reservoir.
The non-Markovian nature of the decay stems from the many round-trips required
for the randomization. We consider the influence of the polarization
measurements by the absorber on this non-Markovian decay, and develop a theory
of the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in this system.

game, one player (Alice) can always win with propability 2/3. But when the
other player (Bob) is allowed to apply quantum strategy, the original unfair
game turns into a fair and zero-sum game. Further more, the procedure in which
Bob perform his quantum strategy does not include any ingredient of
entanglement.
