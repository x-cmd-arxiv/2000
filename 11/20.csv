binned amplitude from the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy

primordial power spectrum is marginally consistent with a scale-invariant
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. However, we deduce a rise in power compared to a
scale-invariant power spectrum for $0.001 h/{Mpc} \la k \la 0.01 h/{Mpc}$. Our
results are consistent with large-scale structure data, and seem to suggest
that the current observational data allow for the possibility of unusual

the surface of a spinning neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) has
observable effects on the waveforms of millisecond X-ray flux oscillations
produced e.g. during type-I bursts or in the millisecond pulsar SAX
J1808.4--3658. We study these effects in the framework of a simplified model in
which there is a single emitting spot on the stellar surface, which is visible
both directly and in X-rays scattered from the disk. The main signature of
scattering from a thin disk is that the pulse of scattered flux leads (if the
star rotates in the same sense as the disk) or lags (in the contrary case) the
primary pulse of direct emission by a quarter of a spin cycle. This is caused
by Doppler boosting of radiation in the sub-relativistic Keplerian flow. The
disk-scattered flux is revealed better in energy-resolved waveforms and the
phase dependence of the polarized flux component. The phenomenon discussed
permits direct testing of the presence of standard thin disks near the neutron
stars in LMXBs and should be observable with future X-ray timing experiments
having a few times better sensitivity than RXTE and also with sensitive X-ray
polarimeters.

  C. M. Urry eds., in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The radiation observed by blazars is believed to originate from the
transformation of bulk kinetic energy of relativistic jets into random energy.
A simple way to achieve this is to have an intermittent central power source,
producing shells of plasma with different bulk Lorentz factors. These shells
will collide at some distance from the center, producing shocks and then
radiation. This scenario, called internal shock model, is thought to be at the
origin of the gamma-rays observed in gamma-ray bursts and can work even better
in blazars. It accounts for the observed key characteristics of these objects,
including the fact that radiation must be preferentially produced at a few
hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the center, but continues to be produced
all along the jet. At the kpc scale and beyond, the slowly moving parts of a
(straight) jet can be illuminated by the beamed radiation of the core, while
the fast parts of the jet will see enhanced cosmic microwave radiation. In both
cases the Inverse Compton process can be the dominant radiation process,
leading to a copious production of high energy (X-rays and beyond) radiation in
both radio loud quasars and radio-galaxies.

335 and PG 1244+026) are well fit by the ionised disc model, and these are
often better fits than the alternative models considered. The sixth galaxy, NGC
4051, has additional spectral complexity that cannot be well described by a
simple ionised disc model or any of the other alternative models. All six of
the NLS1s we considered show evidence for a broad Fe Kalpha line, but none of
the line centroids are consistent with emission from highly ionised Fe. This is
most likely due to the line being redshifted because of relativistic effects.
We note that sources with larger ionisation parameters tend to have larger Fe
Kalpha EWs. We interpret this as evidence that ionised Fe features are making
their presence felt in the spectra. Since most of our sources have steep
spectra, highly ionised features are predicted even by the new variable density
reflection models. The one source we analyse with a photon index less than two
has the lowest ionisation parameter in our sample. We conclude that our result
is the strongest evidence yet that NLS1 might have ionised accretion discs.
This result gives further weight to the hypothesis that these objects contain
rapidly accreting black holes.

shows a small peak just below the surface, the origin of which is traced back
to a local chemical ordering at the surface. Close to the surface the partial
radial distribution functions as well as the distributions of the bond-bond
angles show features which are not observed in the interior of the systems. By
calculating the distribution of the length of the Si-O rings we can show that
these additional features are related to the presence of two-membered rings at
the surface. The surface density of these structures is around 0.6/nm^2 in good
agreement with experimental estimates. From the behavior of the mean-squared
displacement at low temperatures we conclude that at the surface the cage of

diffusion constant is somewhat larger than the one in the bulk and with
decreasing temperature the relative difference grows. The total vibrational

hardening) with a lowering temperature is explained. The effect is caused by a
growth of the exchange interaction between dangling $d$-electron states of
dislocation cores and paramagnetic obstacles (e.g., Ni atoms in FeNi alloys)
which occurs below the Curie temperature. The spins of the two electrons align
along the magnetization due to the exchange interaction with the surrounding
atoms of the ferromagnetic. The exchange interaction between the dislocations
and obstacles is enhanced in Invars due to a strong growth of the magnetic
moments of atoms under the action of elastic strains near the dislocation
cores. Parameters characterizing the exchange interaction are determined for
the case of the Fe$_{0.65}$Ni$_{0.35}$ Invar. The influence of the internal
magnetic field on the dislocation detachment from the obstacles is taken into
account. The obtained temperature dependence of the critical resolved shear
stress in the Fe$_{0.65}$Ni$_{0.35}$ Invar agrees well with the available
experimental data. Experiments facilitating a further check of the theoretical
model are suggested.

$\Delta\rho/\rho$) is anomalously enhanced at lower tempemeratures compared
with conventional Fermi liquids, and thus Kohler's rule is strongly violated.
Moreover, it should be noted that an intimate relation between the MR and the
Hall coefficient ($R_H$), $\Delta\rho/\rho \propto (R_H/\rho)^2$, holds well
experimentally, and is called the ""modified Kohler's rule"". In this letter, we
study this long-standing problem in terms of the nearly antiferromagnetic (AF)
Fermi liquid. We analyze the exact expression for the MR by including the
vertex corrections (VC's) to keep the conservation laws, and find the
approximate ""scaling relation"" $\Delta\rho/\rho \propto \xi_{AF}^4 /\rho^2$
($\xi_{AF}$ being the AF correlation length.) in the presence of AF
fluctuations. The factor $\xi_{AF}^4$, which comes from the VC's for the
current, gives the additional temperature dependence. By taking account of the
relation $R_H \propto \xi_{AF}^2$ [Kontani et al., PRB 59 (1999) 14723.], we
can naturally explain the modified Kohler's rule. In conclusion, based on the
Fermi liquid theory, the famous {\it seemingly} non-Fermi liquid behaviors of
the Hall coefficient and the MR in high-Tc cuprates are naturally understood on
an equal footing.

force is derived by using the Fermi liquid transport theory based on the Kubo
formula. The obtained gauge-invariant expression is exact for any strength of
the interaction, as for the most singular term with respect to 1/\gamma^\ast
(\gammak^\ast being the quasiparticle damping rate). By virtue of the
exactness, the conserving laws are satisfied rigorously in the present
expression, which is indispensable for avoiding unphysical solutions. Based on
the derived expression, we can calculate the MR within the framework of the
Baym-Kadanoff type conserving approximation, by including all the vertex
corrections required by the Ward identity. The present expression is
significant especially for strongly correlated systems because the current
vertex corrections will be much important. On the other hand, if we drop all
the vertex corrections in the formula, we get the MR of the relaxation time
approximation (RTA), which is commonly used because of the simplicity. However,
the RTA is dangerous because it may give unphysical results owing to the lack
of conserving laws. In conclusion, the present work enables us to study the MR
with satisfying the conserving laws which is highly demanded in strongly
correlated electrons, such as high-Tc superconductors, organic metals, and
heavy Fermion systems. In Appendix D, we reply to the comment by O. Narikiyo

in the Yukawa term yields a simpler ``dyadic structure'' in the Fourier

remarkable simplification in all structure functions with respect to previous

when all polydisperse particles have a single, size-independent, stickiness

disordered one dimensional lattices. The density matrix renormalization group
method is used to explore the charge density and the sensitivity of the ground
state energy with respect to the boundary condition (the persistent current)
for a wide range of parameters (carrier density, interaction and disorder).
Analytical approaches are developed and allow to understand some mechanisms and
limiting conditions. For weak interaction strength, one has a Fermi glass of
Anderson localized states, while in the opposite limit of strong interaction,
one has a correlated array of charges (Mott insulator). In the two cases, the
system is strongly insulating and the ground state energy is essentially
invariant under a twist of the boundary conditions. Reducing the interaction
strength from large to intermediate values, the quantum melting of the solid
array gives rise to a more homogeneous distribution of charges, and the ground
state energy changes when the boundary conditions are twisted. In individual
chains, this melting occurs by abrupt steps located at sample-dependent values
of the interaction where an (avoided) level crossing between the ground state
and the first excitation can be observed. Important charge reorganizations take
place at the avoided crossings and the persistent currents are strongly
enhanced around the corresponding interaction value. These large delocalization
effects become smeared and reduced after ensemble averaging. They mainly
characterize half filling and strong disorder, but they persist away of this
optimal condition.

in one dimension lower -- bending a segment into a flat object -- which lead to
interesting problems on strings. We develop efficient algorithms for the

symmetric we understand spacetimes that possess two commuting spacelike Killing
vectors, one of them rotational and the other one translational. The result of
our gauge fixing is a constraint-free model whose phase space has four
field-like degrees of freedom and that depends on three constant parameters.
Two of these constants determine the global angular momentum and the linear
momentum in the axis direction, while the third parameter is related with the
behavior of the metric around the axis. We derive the explicit expression of
the metric in terms of the physical degrees of freedom, calculate the reduced
equations of motion and obtain the Hamiltonian that generates the reduced
dynamics. We also find upper and lower bounds for this reduced Hamiltonian that
provides the energy per unit length contained in the system. In addition, we
show that the reduced formalism constructed is well defined and consistent at
least when the linear momentum in the axis direction vanishes. Furthermore, in
that case we prove that there exists an infinite number of solutions in which
all physical fields are constant both in the surroundings of the axis and at
sufficiently large distances from it. If the global angular momentum is
different from zero, the isometry group of these solutions is generally not
orthogonally transitive. Such solutions generalize the metric of a spinning
cosmic string in the region where no closed timelike curves are present.

vector wave scattering by small bodies of an arbitrary shape with the emphasis
on practical applicability of the formulas obtained and on the mathematical
rigor of the theory. For the scalar wave scattering by a single body, our main
results can be described as follows: (1) Analytical formulas for the scattering
amplitude for a small body of an arbitrary shape are obtained; dependence of
the scattering amplitude on the boundary conditions is described. (2) An
analytical formula for the scattering matrix for electromagnetic wave
scattering by a small body of an arbitrary shape is given. Applications of
these results are outlined (calculation of the properties of a rarefied medium;
inverse radio measurement problem; formulas for the polarization tensors and
capacitance). (3) The multi-particle scattering problem is analyzed and
interaction of the scattered waves is taken into account. For the
self-consistent field in a medium consisting of many particles ~ 10^{23},
integral-differential equations are found. The equations depend on the boundary
conditions on the particle surfaces. These equations offer a possibility of
solving the inverse problem of finding the medium properties from the
scattering data. For about 5 to 10 bodies the fundamental integral equations of
the theory can be solved numerically to study the interaction between the
bodies.

algebra $A$ and the flip automorphism is an automorphism of $A\otimes A$
sending $x\otimes y$ into $y\otimes x$. If $\alpha$ is an inner perturbation of
a UHF flow on $A$, there is a sequence $(u_n)$ of unitaries in $A\otimes A$
such that $\alpha_t\otimes \alpha_t(u_n)-u_n$ converges to zero and the flip is
the limit of $\Ad u_n$. We consider here whether the converse holds or not and
solve it with an additional assumption: If $A\otimes A\cong A$ and $\alpha$
absorbs any UHF flow $\beta$ (i.e., $\alpha\otimes\beta$ is cocycle conjugate
to $\alpha$), then the converse holds; in this case $\alpha$ is what we call a
universal UHF flow.

one-dimensional gas corresponding to the eigenvalue distribution of the
classical random matrix ensembles by restricting the logarithmic pair
interaction to a finite number $k$ of nearest neighbors. We calculate
analytically the spacing distributions and the two-level statistics. In
particular we show that the number variance has the asymptotic form
$\Sigma^2(L)\sim\chi L$ for large $L$ and the nearest-neighbor distribution
decreases exponentially when $s\to \infty$, $P(s)\sim\exp (-\Lambda s)$ with
$\Lambda=1/\chi=k\beta+1$, where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature of the gas
($\beta=$1, 2 and 4 for the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry class
respectively). In the simplest case of $k=\beta=1$, the model leads to the
so-called Semi-Poisson statistics characterized by particular simple
correlation functions e.g. $P(s)=4s\exp(-2s)$. Furthermore we investigate the
spectral statistics of several pseudointegrable quantum billiards numerically
and compare them to the Semi-Poisson statistics.

the one which reproduces the low lying part of the experimental baryon spectrum

inadequate: the usual interpretation of the mathematical formalism in terms of

nothing that can be called a measurement happens at the moment of observation.
Attempts to force such observations into the standard mould lead to absurd
results: ""a watched pot never boils"". Experiments show both that this result is
correct when the experiment does indeed consist of a series of measurements,
and that it is not when the experiment consists of a period of observation:
quantum jumps do happen. The possibilities for improving the formalism by
incorporating transitions in the basic postulates are reviewed, and a
satisfactory postulate is obtained by modifying a suggestion of Bell's. This
requires a distinction between the external description of the whole of a
physical system and internal descriptions which are themselves physical events
in the system. It is shown that this gives correct results for simple unstable
systems and for the quantum-jump experiments.
