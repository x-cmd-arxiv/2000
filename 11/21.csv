implications are obtained. 1) The pulsar spindown in SN 1987A is caused by
radiating gravitational waves rather than by magnetic dipole radiation and/or
relativistic pulsar winds. 2) A mildly deformed shock wave would be formed at
the core-collapse and explosion in SN 1987A, which is consistent with the
conclusion given in Nagataki (2000). 3) The gravitational waves from the pulsar
should be detected in several years using a Fabry-Perot-Michelson
interferometer as the gravitational detector, such as LIGO and TAMA. 4) The
neutrino oscillation model is not a promising model for the explanation of the
kick velocity of the pulsar in SN 1987A. The hydrodynamical instability model
is more favored.

resolve 111 X-ray sources with luminosities between 7x10^{28} ergs/s and

much more heavily absorbed, with N_H in the range of 10^22 to 10^23 cm^-2. The
main objective of this paper is to study the Orion Trapezium and its close

two-temperature thermal spectrum with a soft component of kT ~ 0.8 keV and a
hard component of kT ~ 2 to 3 keV. We discuss these results in the context of
stellar wind models. We detect eight additional, mostly variable X-ray sources
in the close vicinity of the Trapezium. Five of these X-rays sources are
identified with proplyds and we argue that the X-ray emission originates from
class I, II and III protostars at the cores of the proplyds.

not consistent with single ""glitch"" type events, nor are they consistent with

research is discussed, with emphasis on the Boomerang and Maxima balloon

inflation-based cosmic structure formation paradigm. Here we primarily focus on
a simplified inflation parameter set, {omega_b,omega_{cdm},Omega_{tot},
Omega_Q,w_Q, n_s,tau_C, sigma_8}. After marginalizing over the other cosmic and
experimental variables, we find the current CMB+LSS+SN1 data gives
Omega_{tot}=1.04\pm 0.05, consistent with (non-baroque) inflation theory.
Restricting to Omega_{tot}=1, we find a nearly scale invariant spectrum, n_s

range, but the baryon density, omega_b=0.030\pm 0.004, is slightly larger than
the current nucleosynthesis estimate. Substantial dark energy is inferred,
Omega_Q\approx 0.68\pm 0.05, and CMB+LSS Omega_Q values are compatible with the
independent SN1 estimates. The dark energy equation of state, parameterized by
a quintessence-field pressure-to-density ratio w_Q, is not well determined by
CMB+LSS (w_Q<-0.3 at 95%CL), but when combined with SN1 the resulting w_Q<-0.7
limit is quite consistent with the w_Q=-1 cosmological constant case. Though
forecasts of statistical errors on parameters for current and future

the final limb crossing. These changes are not seen in contemporaneous spectra
of control stars in the FORS1 slit, but are qualitatively consistent with

conclusion that the local Hubble patch we can access has little mean curvature

The MHD kink instability generates coils in the tube and subsequent magnetic
reconnection injects relativistic electrons. Electrons diffuse away from a coil
at an energy-dependent rate producing a flat spectral index at large distances
from it. Our fit to the data of \citet{gray95a} shows that the magnetic field
$\sim 0.4 \> \rm mG$ is large compared to the ambient $\sim 7 \mu \> \rm G$
field, indicating that the flux tube is force-free. If the {\em relative} level
of turbulence in the Snake and the general interstellar medium are similar,
then electrons have been diffusing in the Snake for about $3 \times 10^5 \> \rm
yr$, comparable to the timescale at which magnetic energy is annihilated in the
major kink. Estimates of the magnetic field in the G359.19-0.05 molecular
complex are similar to our estimate of the magnetic field in the Snake
suggesting a strong connection between the physics of the anchoring molecular
regions and the Snake. We suggest that the physical processes considered here
may be relevant to many of the radio filaments near the Galactic Center. We
also suggest further observations of the Snake and other filaments that would
be useful for obtaining further insights into the physics of these objects.

1473 K - in rare-earth manganite series of compounds reveals a very interesting
feature : normally observed insulating pattern beyond Tc (Curie Point) gives
way to a reentrant metallic pattern around a characteristic temperature T*. The
transport activation barrier Ea collapses to zero around T*. T* is found to be
dependent on the carrier concentration or the concentration of the
Jahn-Teller-active Mn(3+) ions as well as on the average A-site radius <rA> for
a fixed carrier concentration. These factors govern the effective lattice
distortion and hence lead to the variation in the conduction bandwidth. Our
data cover a wide range - from T*>>Tc for smaller bandwidth to T* tending
towards Tc for larger bandwidth. These results seem to provide evidence of the
onset of lattice distortion at high temperature (around T*) and its variation.
Since lattice distortion governs the magnetic, transport and other important
behaviors significantly, our data assume importance as they offer a new measure
of the effective distortion and its tunability.

find here that the statistical properties of the energy dissipation are
practically unchanged with respect to homogeneous isotropic conditions, while
the increased intermittency is entirely captured in terms of the new similarity

nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems: prediction, filtering, and smoothing.
Our new approach is based upon a proper choice of cost function, termed the
{\it effective action}. We show that this functional of time-histories is the
unique statistically well-founded cost function to determine most probable
histories within empirical ensembles. The ensemble dispersion about the sample
mean history can also be obtained from the Hessian of the cost function. We
show that the effective action can be calculated by a variational prescription,
which generalizes the ``sweep method'' used in optimal linear estimation. An
iterative numerical scheme results which converges globally to the variational
estimator. This scheme involves integrating forward in time a ``perturbed''
Fokker-Planck equation, very closely related to the Kushner-Stratonovich
equation for optimal filtering, and an adjoint equation backward in time,
similarly related to the Pardoux-Kushner equation for optimal smoothing. The
variational estimator enjoys a somewhat weaker property, which we call ``mean
optimality''. However, the variational scheme has the principal
advantage---crucial for practical applications---that it admits a wide variety
of finite-dimensional moment-closure approximations. The moment approximations
are derived reductively from the Euler-Lagrange variational formulation and
preserve the good structural properties of the optimal estimator.

distance according to the curve 1, Fig. 1. However, dissociation of molecules
(for example, Te2=2Te) often is a chemical reaction. According to chemical
kinetics, chemical reactions overcome a potential barrier. This barrier is
absent at the curve 1. It is a very strong argument against the curve 1. It is
shown that the molecule energy dependence on interatomic distance can behave at
large distances not so but like the curve 2, Fig. 1. Earlier it has been
supposed that quantum chemical methods give a wrong result at big distances if
the wave function does not turn to zero. In this paper, it is been shown that
it must not turn to zero. The wave function can be a piecewise function.

classical side information is included in the tradeoff. Using a natural
distortion measure based on entanglement fidelity and specializing to the case
of an unrestricted classical side channel, we find the exact quantum
rate-distortion function for a source of isotropic qubits. An upper bound we
believe to be exact is found in the case of biased sources. We establish that
in this scenario optimal rate-distortion codes produce no entropy exchange with
the environment of any individual qubit.

intrusion of the observer into the measurement process. Such intrusion is
usually seen to arise because observation somehow selects a single actuality
from among the many possibilities represented by the wavefunction. The issue is
typically treated in terms of the mathematical formulation of the quantum
theory. We attempt to address a different manifestation of the quantum
measurement problem in a theory-neutral manner. With a version of the two-slit
experiment, we demonstrate that an enigma arises directly from the results of
experiments. Assuming that no observable physical phenomena exist beyond those
predicted by the theory, we argue that no interpretation of the quantum theory
can avoid a measurement problem involving the observer.

state of a microscopic spin half system. The measuring apparatus is a heavy
particle, whose center of mass coordinates can be considered at the end of the
measurement as approximately classical, and thus can be used as a pointer. The
state of the pointer, which is the result of its interaction with the spin, is
transformed into a mixed state by the coupling of the pointer to the
environment. The environment is considered to be a gas reservoir, whose
particles interact with the pointer. This results in a Fokker-Planck equation
for the reduced density matrix of the pointer. The solution of the equation
shows that the quantum coherences, which are characteristic to the entangled
state between the probabilities to find the pointer in one of two positions,
decays exponentially fast in time. We calculate the exponential decay function
of this decoherence effect, and express it in terms of the parameters of the
model.
