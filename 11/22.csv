cosmologies (LCDM, OCDM, QCDM, and tilted SCDM), each containing 10^5 clusters
of galaxies in a cubic gigaparsec volume, are used to determine the evolution
of the cluster mass function from z=3 to z=0. The large volume and high
resolution of these simulations allow an accurate measure of the evolution of
cosmologically important (but rare) massive clusters at high redshift. The
simulated mass function is presented for cluster masses within several radii
typically used observationally (R=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 Mpc/h, both comoving and
physical) in order to enable direct comparison with current and future
observations. The simulated evolution is compared with current observations of
massive clusters at redshifts 0.3<z<0.8. The Omega_m=1 tilted SCDM model, which
exhibits very rapid evolution of the cluster abundance, produces too few
clusters at z>0.3 and no massive clusters at z>0.5, in stark contradiction with
observations. The Omega_m=0.3 models- LCDM, OCDM, and QCDM- all exhibit
considerably weaker evolution and are consistent with current data. Among these
low density models, OCDM evolves the least. These trends are enhanced at high
redshift and can be used to discriminate between flat and open low density
models. The simulated mass functions are compared with the Press-Schechter
approximation. Standard Press-Schechter predicts too many low mass clusters at
z=0, and too few clusters at higher redshift. We modify the approximation by a
simple parameterization of the density contrast threshold for collapse, which
has a redshift dependence. This modified Press-Schechter approximation provides
a good fit to the simulated mass functions.

may be used as a tool for studying the kinematics and extinction effects in the
Galactic bulge. In this paper, we first investigate the expected distribution
of the microlensed sources as a function of depth within the Galactic bulge.
Our analysis takes a magnitude limited microlensing survey into account, and
includes the effects of extinction. We show that, in the current magnitude
limited surveys, the probability that the source lies at the far side of the
bulge is larger than the probability that the source lies at the near side. We
then investigate the effects of extinction on the observed spectra of
microlensed sources. Kurucz model spectra and the observed extinctions towards
the Galactic bulge have been used to demonstrate that the microlensed sources
should clearly show the effects of extinction which, in turn, can be used as a
statistical measure of the contribution of the disk lenses and bulge lenses at
different depths. The spectra of the microlensed sources provide a unique probe
to derive the radial velocities of a sample which lies preferentially at the
far side of the Galactic bulge. The radial velocities, coupled with the
microlensing time scales, can thus be useful in studying the 3-dimensional
kinematics of the Galactic bulge.

this scenario has not yet been confirmed by proper time-dependent modelling.
Non-linear time-dependent calculations performed by Szuszkiewicz and Miller

successive evacuation and refilling of the central parts of the disc. This
evolution is very similar to the one proposed by Belloni et al. (1997) in their
phenomenological model. Further investigations are needed to confirm the
thermal instability being operational in this source. First of all the spectra

The second simulation has isorotation contours about mid-way between cylinders

  We show that the solar differential rotation is directly related to a
latitudinal entropy gradient, which pervades into the deep layers of the
convection zone. We also offer an explanation of the angular velocity shear
found at low latitudes near the top. A non-zero correlation between radial and
zonal velocity fluctuations produces a significant Reynolds stress in that
region. This constitutes a net transport of angular momentum inwards, which
causes a slight modification of the overall structure of the differential
rotation near the top. In essence, the {\it thermodynamics controls the
dynamics through the Taylor-Proudman momentum balance}. The Reynolds stresses
only become significant in the surface layers, where they generate a weak
meridional circulation and an angular velocity `bump'.

largely determine the photonic pathways of H2 molecules in the PDR close to the

star, the total rate at which an H2 molecule is nonlinearly photoexcited out of

the total rate at which it is linearly photoexcited out of the same level. In
strongly excited PDRs, the populations in almost all of the ~300 bound quantum
levels of the X state will be maintained approximately equal via a few myriads
of interconnecting two-photon steps. The remarkable importance of two-photon
transitions in H2 photoexcitation in strongly irradiated PDRs derives from the
exceptionally narrow Raman linewidth that characterizes all two-photon
transitions between bound H2 X-state quantum levels.

information from both along and across QSO lines of sight, thus enabling a full
determination of the three-dimensional clustering of absorbers, as well as a
comparison of line- and cross-line-of-sight clustering properties. Here we
present the three-dimensional reduced second-moment estimator for a
three-dimensional point process probed by one-dimensional lines of sight, and
apply our algorithm to a sample of 345 C IV absorbers with median redshift of
2.2, drawn from the spectra of 276 QSOs. We confirm the existence of
significant clustering on comoving scales up to 100 Mpc, and find that the
additional cross-line-of-sight information strengthens the evidence for
clustering on scales from 100 Mpc to 150 Mpc. There is no evidence of absorber
clustering along or across lines of sight for scales from 150 Mpc to 300 Mpc.
We show that with a 300-times larger catalog, such as that to be compiled by
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (100,000 QSOs), use of the full three-dimensional
estimator and cross-line-of-sight information will substantially increase
clustering sensitivity. We find that standard errors are reduced by an
additional factor of 2 to 20 on scales of 30 to 200 Mpc, effectively increasing

transitions associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking {\em during} the

the primordial density perturbation for brief periods. A possible such feature
was identified in the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in the APM survey at
the scale $k \sim 0.1 h$ Mpc^{-1} and it was shown that the secondary acoustic
peaks in the power spectrum of the CMB anisotropy should consequently be
suppressed. We demonstrate that this prediction is confirmed by the recent
Boomerang and Maxima observations, which favour a step-like spectral feature in
the range $k \sim (0.06-0.6)h$ Mpc^{-1}, independently of the similar previous
indication from the APM data. Such a spectral break enables an excellent fit to
both APM and CMB data with a baryon density consistent with the BBN value. It
also allows the possibility of a matter-dominated universe with zero
cosmological constant, which we show can now account for even the evolution of
the abundance of rich clusters.

Herschel Deep Field to show that these same models give detailed fits to the
faint galaxy r-i:b-r colour-colour diagram. We then use these models to predict
the number counts of high redshift galaxies detected by the Lyman break
technique. At z~3 there is almost exact agreement between ou r prediction and
the data, suggesting that the space density of galaxies at z~3 may be close to
its local value. At z~4 the space density of bright galaxies remains unchanged;
however, the space density of dwarf galaxies is significantly lower than it is
locally, suggesting that we have detected an epoch of dwarf galaxy formation at
z~4. Finally, significant numbers of Lyman-break galaxy candidates are also
detected at z~6 in the Hubble and Herschel Deep Fields; taking this observation
together with a number of recent detections of spectroscopically confirmed z~6
galaxies suggests that the space density of bright galaxies at z~6 remains
comparable to the local space density and thus that the epoch of formation of

collisions per Hubble time; two more explore the long (``collisionless'') and
short (``fluid'') mean free path limits. We study the size and shape
distributions of arcs and compute the cross-section for producing ``extreme''
arcs of various sizes. Even a few collisions per particle modify the core
structure enough to destroy the cluster's ability to produce long, thin arcs.
For larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to
unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce giant
arcs. None of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except the
``fluid'' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with the
smallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit of observed
cluster masses before it produces radial arcs. Apparently the elastic collision
cross-section of dark matter in clusters must be very small, below 0.1 cm^2
g^-1, to be compatible with the observed ability of clusters to produce both
radial arcs and giant arcs.

an applied magnetic flux, while spin-($- \sigma$) electrons are not directly

oscillates as a function of the flux to which spin-$\sigma$ electrons are
coupled. It is predicted that the effect exists both with high and low
transparency contacts, and that the electrodes can be normal metal in which
phase coherence can propagate over large distances. Three other aspects of the

all degrees of freedom relevant to folding - all sidechain and backbone
torsions - and uses a Go potential. In this study, we focus on the 46 residue
alpha-beta protein crambin and two of its structural components, the helix and
helix hairpin. For a wide range of temperatures, we have recorded multiple
folding events of these three structures from random coils to native
conformations that differ by less than 1 A dRMS from their crystal structure
coordinates. The thermodynamics and kinetic mechanism of the helix-coil
transition obtained from our simulation shows excellent agreement with
currently available experimental and molecular dynamics data. Based on insights
obtained from folding its smaller structural components, a possible folding
mechanism for crambin is proposed. We observe that the folding occurs via a
cooperative, first order-like process, and that many folding pathways to the
native state exist. One particular sequence of events constitutes a
``fast-folding'' pathway where kinetic traps are avoided. At very low
temperatures, a kinetic trap arising from the incorrect packing of sidechains
was observed. These results demonstrate that folding to the native state can be
observed in a reasonable amount of time on desktop computers even when an
all-atom representation is used, provided the energetics sufficiently stabilize
the native state.

change of the relative doping concentration upon isotope substitution. Close to
the QSI transition both, the isotope coefficient of transition temperature and
penetration depth approach the coefficient of the relative dopant

and coupled to a harmonic quantum thermal bath is exactly solvable. It is shown
that at low enough temperatures the stationary state is non-Gibbsian due to an
entanglement with the bath. In physical terms, this happens when the cloud of
bath modes around the particle starts to play a non-trivial role. Indeed,
equilibrium thermodynamics of the total system, particle plus bath, does not
imply standard equilibrium thermodynamics for the particle itself at low $T$.
Various formulations of the second law are found to be invalid at low $T$.
First, the Clausius inequality can be violated, because heat can be extracted
from the zero point energy of the cloud of bath modes. Second, when the width
of the confining potential is suddenly changed, there occurs a relaxation to
equilibrium during which the entropy production is partly negative. Third, for
non-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can
be negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which
extract work from the bath. Conditions are put forward under which perpetuum
mobile of the second kind, having one or several work extraction cycles, enter
the realm of condensed matter physics. Fourth, it follows that the equivalence
between different formulations of the second law (e.g. those by Clausius and
Thomson) can be violated at low temperatures. These effects are the consequence
of quantum entanglement in the presence of the slightly off-equilibrium nature
of the thermal bath, and become important when the characteristic quantum time
scale $\hbar/k_BT$ is larger than or comparable to other timescale of the
system. They show that there is no general consensus between standard
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

recoverd on the brane other than corrections due to the massive Kaluza-Klein
modes. As a by-product of using the covariant curvature tensor formalism, it is
immediately seen that the cosmological scalar, vector and tensor type
perturbations all have the same Kaluza-Klein spectrum. On the other hand, if
there are two branes with positive and negative tensions, the gravity on each
brane takes corrections from the radion mode in addition to the Kaluza-Klein
modes and the radion is found to have a negative mass-squared proportional to
the curvature of the de Sitter brane, in contrast to the flat brane case in
which the radion mass vanishes and degenerates with the 4-dimensional graviton
modes. To relate our result with the metric perturbation approach, we derive
the second order action for the brane displacement. We find that the radion
identified in our approach indeed corresponds to the relative displacement of
the branes in the Randall-Sundrum gauge and describes the scalar curvature
perturbations of the branes in the gaussian normal coordinates around the
branes. Implications to the inflationary brane universe are briefly discussed.

ensure that the metric arising from this gauge fixing is well defined and that
the resulting reduced system has a consistent Hamiltonian dynamics. These
boundary conditions must be imposed both on the symmetry axis and in the region
far from the axis at spacelike infinity. Employing such conditions, we
determine the asymptotic behaviour of the metric close to and far from the

geometry with a time dislocation. In particular, around the symmetry axis the
effect of the singularity consists in inducing a constant deficit angle and a
timelike helical structure. Based on these results and on the fact that the
degrees of freedom in our family of metrics coincide with those of cylindrical
vacuum gravity, we argue that the analysed set of spacetimes represent
cylindrical gravitational waves surrounding a spinning cosmic string. For any

describe hyperon beta decay. It was observed for the first time only in 1997
even though its importance had been explicitly stated in 1961 by the early
theories of the standard model as formulated by N. Cabibbo. We have the ability
to improve this measurement substantially by making the definitive form-factor
measurement with a sample of 30,000 such decays from a forthcoming experiment,
which will either show or rule out the existence any additional second class
weak currents, an obviously important measurement allowing particle physics to
finally put this question to rest. We also have the ability to make a
measurement of hyperon compositeness by measuring the charged $\Sigma^{\pm}$
beta decay into $\Lambda^0$, and in addition to search for mass coupling terms
in hyperon beta decays where the muon replaces the electron, important for
determining the $g_3$ and $f_3$ form-factors. These are the important questions
to answer in studying strange baryon decays, and are reviewed in this article.

iterations of the map reveal that, at values of the system's stepsize (cell's
size) L comparable to the pulse's dispersion length, SSM supports stable pulses
which almost exactly coincide with fundamental solitons of the averaged NLS
equation. However, in contrast with the NLS equation, the SSM soliton is a
strong attractor, i.e., a perturbed soliton rapidly relaxes to it, emitting
some radiation. A pulse whose initial amplitude is too large splits into two
solitons; splitting can be suppressed by appropriately chirping the initial
pulse. If the initial amplitude is too small, the pulse turns into a breather,
and, below a certain threshold, it quickly decays into radiation. If L is
essentially larger than the soliton's dispersion length, the soliton rapidly
rearranges itself into another soliton, with nearly the same area but
essentially smaller energy. At L still larger, the pulse becomes unstable, with
a complex system of stability windows found inside the unstable region. Moving
solitons are generated by lending them a frequency shift, which makes it
possible to consider collisions between solitons.

nucleon-nucleon scattering, within the one boson exchange approximation; and,
infinite nuclear matter including the effects of two-nucleon correlations.
Standard good results for nuclear saturation properties are obtained, with a
possible improvement in the lowered value, 180 MeV, of the computed nuclear
compressibility. In our approach, manifest rotational invariance emerges at the
end of the calculation. Thus nuclear physics can be done in a manner in which
modern nuclear dynamics can be implemented and symmetries are respected. A
salient feature is that $\omega,\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons are obtained as
important constituents. These can contribute coherently to enhance nuclear
electroproduction cross sections for longitudinal virtual photons at low $Q^2$,
while depleting the cross section for transverse photons. Thus the recent
HERMES inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering data at low $Q^2$ and small $x$ can
be described using photon-meson and meson-nucleus couplings which are
consistent with constraints obtained from meson decay widths, nuclear
structure, deep inelastic scattering, and lepton pair production data. Our

field in harmonic oscillator trap and in a trap with anharmonicities. The
anharmonicities of the trap are quantified in terms of the deformation
parameter $\tau $ characterizing the q-analog of the harmonic oscillator trap.
Initially the ion is prepared in a Schr\""{o}dinger cat state. The entanglement
of the center of mass motional states and the internal degrees of freedom of
the ion results in characteristic collapse and revival pattern. We calculate
numerically the population inversion I(t), quasi-probabilities $Q(t),$ and
partial mutual quantum entropy S(P), for the system as a function of time.
Interestingly, small deformations of the trap enhance the contrast between
population inversion collapse and revival peaks as compared to the zero
deformation case. For \beta =3 and $4,(% \beta $ determines the average number
of trap quanta linked to center of mass motion) the best collapse and revival
sequence is obtained for \tau =0.0047 and \tau =0.004 respectively. For large
values of \tau decoherence sets in accompanied by loss of amplitude of
population inversion and for \tau \sim 0.1 the collapse and revival phenomenon
disappear. Each collapse or revival of population inversion is characterized by
a peak in S(P) versus t plot. During the transition from collapse to revival
and vice-versa we have minimum mutual entropy value that is S(P)=0. Successive
revival peaks show a lowering of the local maximum point indicating a
dissipative irreversible change in the ionic state. Improved definition of
collapse and revival pattern as the anharminicity of the trapping potential
increases is also reflected in the Quasi- probability versus t plots.

  systems","4 pages, Revtex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a general method to find the upper and lower bounds on the
generalized entanglement of formation for multi-party systems. The upper and
lower bounds can be expressed in terms of the bi-partite entanglements of
formation and/or entropies of various subsystems. The examples for tri- and
four-party systems in the both pure states and mixed states are given. We also
suggest a little modified definition of generalized entanglement of formation
for multi-party systems if EPR pairs are thought of belonging to the set of
maximally entangled states.

according to the rovibrational quantum state of the molecules. Our numerical
calculation shows that single state resolution can be achieved by properly
tuned, monochromatic light. The proposed scheme allows for selecting
non-vibrating and non-rotating molecules from a thermal beam, implementing a
laser Maxwell's demon to prepare a rovibrationally cold molecular ensemble.
