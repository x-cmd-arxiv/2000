star formation. Line emission should be an indicator of star formation
activity, but searches based on Lyman-alpha are unreliable because of the
selective extinction of this resonant UV line. Using more robust lines such as
H-alpha forces a move to the near-infrared at z>1. For line emission searches,
spectroscopy is more sensitive than imaging, but previous long-slit
spectroscopic searches have been hampered by the likelihood that any star
forming region in the DLA galaxy disk would fall outside the narrow slit. The
new integral field units such as CIRPASS on Gemini will cover sufficient solid
angles to intercept these, even in the extreme case of large galactic disks at
high redshift. On an 8m-class telescope, star formation rates of <1M_sun/yr
will be reached at z~1.4 with H-alpha in the H-band. Such star formation rates
are well below L* for the high-z Lyman-break population, and are comparable
locally to the luminous giant HII complexes in M101. It appears that
instruments such as CIRPASS on Gemini will have both the sensitivity and the
survey area to measure star formation rates in z>1 DLAs. These observations
will probe the nature of damped Lyman-alpha systems and address their relation

considered here are the two- and three-dimensional genus of isodensity contour,
the area of surface, the length of contour intersecting with a plane and the

results show that the nonlinear correction can be sensitive to a choice of the
redshift-space coordinate as increasing the redshift. The low-dimensional

abundances of gaseous H2O and O2 in dense molecular clouds which are
significantly lower than found in standard homogeneous chemistry models. We
present here results for the thermal and chemical balance of inhomogeneous

H2O and O2 are computed for various density distributions, radiation field
strengths and geometries. It is found that an inhomogeneous density
distribution lowers the column densities of H2O and O2 compared to the
homogeneous case by more than an order of magnitude at the same A_V. O2 is
particularly sensitive to the penetrating ultraviolet radiation, more so than
H2O. The S140 and rho Oph clouds are studied as relevant test cases of
star-forming and quiescent regions. The SWAS results of S140 can be
accommodated naturally in a clumpy model with mean density of 2x10^3 cm-3 and
enhancement I_UV=140 compared with the average interstellar radiation field, in
agreement with observations of [CI] and 13CO of this cloud. Additional
radiative transfer computations suggest that this diffuse H2O component is
warm, ~60-90 K, and can account for the bulk of the 1_10-1_01 line emission
observed by SWAS. The rho Oph model yields consistent O2 abundances but too
much H2O, even for [C]/[O]=0.94, if I_UV<10 respectively <40 for a mean density
of 10^3 respectively 10^4 cm-3. It is concluded that enhanced photodissociation
in clumpy regions can explain the low H2O and O2 abundances and emissivities
found in the large SWAS beam for extended molecular clouds, but that additional
freeze-out of oxygen onto grains is needed in dense cold cores.

galaxies, whose distinctive feature is often the simultaneous presence in the
spectra of a strong $\rm H\delta$ line in absorption and of emission lines
(e(a) spectra). A discrepancy between the star formation rate estimated from
the FIR luminosity and that derived from the $\rm H\alpha$ luminosity persists
even after having corrected the $\rm H\alpha$ flux for dust according to the
observed Balmer decrement. It is shown that the e(a) spectrum can be reproduced
assuming a current starburst and dust extinction affecting the youngest stellar
populations much more than the older stars.

configurations exist in a tidal field is analyzed in this paper. More
specifically, we address the question of how to predict initial configurations
modeling galaxies that are able to survive environmental effects in a dense
environment for a Hubble time or so, provided thay dynamical friction is
neglected. The initial quasi-equilibrium configurations have been built up
taking into account the external tidal field produced by the halo. It modifies
the escape velocity field of the configuration, compared with isolated
configurations. The survival of the configurations as they orbit inside the
halos has been studied through N-body simulations. As a general result, it has
been found out that the bulk of the models is conserved along 12.5 Gyears of
evolution, and that the low rates of mass losses they experience are consistent
with those expected when the adiabatic protection hypothesis is at work. So,
solutions for galaxy configurations in tidal quasi-equilibrium have been found,
showing that tidal stripping in quiescent phases does not seem to be very
important, unless that the density of the galaxy environment at its formation
had been much lower than that of the galaxy environment at the point of its
orbit where the tidal perturbation is maximum. (Abridged)

presence of H2 in the z_abs = 2.3377, metal-poor ([Si/H] = -1.20) system toward
PKS 1232+082. The derived molecular fraction, f = 2N(H2)/(2N(H2)+N(HI)) = 4
10-4, is two orders of magnitude less than what has been claimed previously
from low-resolution data. The physical conditions within the cloud can be
constrained directly from observation. The kinetic temperature and particle
density are in the ranges, respectively, 100<T<300 K and 30<nH<50 cm-3. In
addition, UV pumping is of the same order of magnitude than in our Galaxy. The
upper limits on the molecular fraction derived in nine of the systems are in
the range 1.2 10-7 - 1.6 10-5. The molecular abundance in a few DLA systems
(and in particular in the two systems where H2 is detected) is consistent with
what is seen in the Magellanic clouds. But most of the DLA measurements are
well below these values. This is probably partly due to small amounts of dust
and/or high UV flux. We argue however that the lack of molecules is a direct
consequence of high kinetic temperature (T>3000 K) implying a low formation
rate of H2 onto dust grains. Therefore, most of the DLA systems arise in warm
and diffuse neutral gas. (Abridged)

accelerations only, and the deceleration of the Hubble flow as a background
field which influences the dynamics of a finite size region. In the context of
this theory, the equation for the evolution of spherically symmetric
over-densities is non-linear and implies very rapid growth even in a
low-density background, particularly at the epoch when the putative
cosmological constant begins to dominate the Hubble expansion. Small comoving
scales enter the MOND regime earlier than larger scales and therefore evolve to
large over-densities sooner. Taking the initial COBE-normalized power spectrum

power-spectrum resembles that of the standard LCDM universe and thus retains
the empirical successes of that model.

of electron from a magnetic impurity placed in one arm of an open mesoscopic

impurity spin. Earlier studies have shown that such an entanglement causes
reduction or loss of interference in the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations leading to
decoherence. We find however, that this entanglement, in contradiction to the
naive expectation of a reduction of current magnification, leads to enhancement
as well as suppression of the effect. We also observe additional novel features

randomly entangled rings on the chain length, more specifically the second
topological moment $<n^2>$, i.e. the average squared linking number, may be

  Predicates","Appeared also in Electronic Notes in Computer Science vol. 30",,,,"cs.PL",,"  For logic programs with arithmetic predicates, showing termination is not
easy, since the usual order for the integers is not well-founded. A new method,
easily incorporated in the TermiLog system for automatic termination analysis,
is presented for showing termination in this case.
  The method consists of the following steps: First, a finite abstract domain
for representing the range of integers is deduced automatically. Based on this
abstraction, abstract interpretation is applied to the program. The result is a
finite number of atoms abstracting answers to queries which are used to extend
the technique of query-mapping pairs. For each query-mapping pair that is
potentially non-terminating, a bounded (integer-valued) termination function is
guessed. If traversing the pair decreases the value of the termination
function, then termination is established. Simple functions often suffice for
each query-mapping pair, and that gives our approach an edge over the classical
approach of using a single termination function for all loops, which must
inevitably be more complicated and harder to guess automatically. It is worth
noting that the termination of McCarthy's 91 function can be shown
automatically using our method.
  In summary, the proposed approach is based on combining a finite abstraction
of the integers with the technique of the query-mapping pairs, and is
essentially capable of dividing a termination proof into several cases, such
that a simple termination function suffices for each case. Consequently, the
whole process of proving termination can be done automatically in the framework
of TermiLog and similar systems.

amplitudes. Bootstrap quark model allows to describe the light and heavy hadron
spectroscopy based on three principles: unitarity, analicity and crossing
symmetry. The resulting quark interaction appeared to be effectively
short-range. This interaction is determined mainly by the exchange in the gluon
channel: the constituent-gluon mass appeared to not be small. Our calculation
indicates an important role of an interaction which is induced by instantons.
Such an interaction is necessary for deriving both the pion mass and
$\eta$-$\eta'$ mass splitting. However, due to the rules of $1/N_c$-expansion
this interaction influences slightly the other channels while in the
$\eta$-$\eta'$ channel it provides the correct values of masses and gives the
angle of $\eta_1-\eta_8$ mixture close to that of the quark model. We discuss
the possibility of constructing the amplitudes which take into account the

M,M' in terms of special Lagrangian fibrations f : M --> B and f' : M' --> B

  One of the main problems in proving the SYZ Conjecture (or even in finding
the right statement of it) is that the singularities of special Lagrangian
3-folds and fibrations are poorly understood. This paper studies the
singularities of special Lagrangian fibrations.
  Our main rigorous results are the construction of examples of special
Lagrangian fibrations on open subsets of C^3. The simplest are given
explicitly, and the rest are constructed using analytic existence results from
the author's three papers math.DG/0111324, math.DG/0111326, math.DG/0204343 on
U(1)-invariant special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3.
  We then argue, without full proofs, that some features of our examples should
also hold for special Lagrangian fibrations f : M --> B of (almost) Calabi-Yau
3-folds, especially in the generic case. In particular, f will not be smooth
but only piecewise-smooth, and the discriminant (set of singular fibres) of f
will be of codimension 1 in B, and will typically be composed of 'ribbons'.
Finally we draw some conclusions on the SYZ Conjecture, which contradict some
stronger statements of it.

is thus replaced by a linear category. Another important difference from the

transport in these systems can be characterized in terms of the propagation
velocity of perturbations $V_p$. A linear stability analysis is sufficient to
capture all the relevant aspects associated to propagation of infinitesimal
disturbances. In particular, this analysis gives the propagation velocity $V_L$
of infinitesimal errors. If linear mechanisms prevail on the nonlinear ones
$V_p = V_L$. On the contrary, if nonlinear effects are predominant finite
amplitude disturbances can eventually propagate faster than infinitesimal ones
(i.e. $V_p > V_L$). The finite size Lyapunov exponent can be successfully
employed to discriminate the linear or nonlinear origin of information flow. A
generalization of finite size Lyapunov exponent to a comoving reference frame
allows to state a marginal stability criterion able to provide $V_p$ both in
the linear and in the nonlinear case. Strong analogies are found between
information spreading and propagation of fronts connecting steady states in
reaction-diffusion systems. The analysis of the common characteristics of these
two phenomena leads to a better understanding of the role played by linear and

measure simultaneously $pd\to {^3H} \pi^+$ and $pd\to {^3He} \pi^0$
differential cross sections at beam momenta of 750 MeV/c, 800 MeV/c, and 850
MeV/c over a large angular range. The extracted total cross sections for the
$pd\to {^3He} \pi^0$ reactions bridge a gap between near threshold data and
those in the resonance region. The ratio of the cross sections for the two
reaction channels taken at the same $\eta={p^{cm}_\pi}/m_\pi$ yields
$2.11\pm0.08$ indicating that a deviation from isospin symmetry is very small.

with the 3P0 pair-creation model of strong decays. This approach allows the
estimation of branching fractions for baryon states missing in pion nucleon
elastic scattering analyses but expected to be present in electromagnetic
production. Prospects for the discovery of hybrid baryons are discussed. A
subjective list of the most important corrections required to this approach is
presented.

decay database to identify the gamma lines and to determine the cross sections.
The 27Al(p,x)22Na reaction was used to monitor the proton flux. Results of a
feasibility study of the auxiliary 27Al(p,x)24Na and 27Al(p,x)7Be monitor
reactions in the 0.07-2.6 GeV proton-energy range are presented as well. Most
of the experimental data have been analyzed by the LAHET (with ISABEL and
Bertini options), CEM95, CEM2k, INUCL, CASCADE, CASCADE/INPE, and YIELDX codes
that simulate hadron-nucleus interactions.

express the potential energy surface of H_3 in terms of Coulomb and exchange
energies which can be calculated either by perturbation theory or using the
surface integral method (SIM). By applying the Rayleigh-Schroedinger
perturbation theory, GHL theory for the quartet spin state of H_3 is shown to
yield results equivalent to the symmetrized Rayleigh-Schroedinger version of
symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). This equivalence allows a
comparison with the corresponding results obtained by the surface integral
method. The surface integral result calculated with a product of atomic wave
functions is found to have certain advantages over the perturbation approach.

observed with the help of measuring populations and coherence in a single

central idea is the introduction of convex sets for exact, probabilistic, and
approximate conversions, which are closed under LOCC operations and which are
largely characterized by simple properties of pure states.
