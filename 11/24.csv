optically non-detected afterglows are not affected by particularly large
Galactic absorbing columns, since its distribution is similar for both the
detected and non-detected burst subclasses. We then investigate the hypothesis
that the failure of detecting the optical afterglow is due to absorption at the
source location. We find that this is a marginally viable interpretation, but
only if the X-ray burst and afterglow emission and the possible optical/UV
flash do not destroy the dust responsible for absorption in the optical band.
If dust is efficiently destroyed, we are led to conclude that bursts with no
detected optical afterglow are intrinsically different. Prompt infrared
observations are the key to solve this issue.

numerically the general-relativistic radiative transfer equation in the

that power-law spectra result from multiple scatterings, in a way similar to
thermal Comptonization. We also find that photon-electron interactions taking
place near the black-hole event horizon affect very little the emerging

distinguishing signatures of the compact object around which they are produced.
We examine the dependence of the spectra on simplifications often employed
regarding the spacetime geometry, the distribution of photon sources, and the
boundary conditions. We show that the existence of trapped characteristics
around a black hole reduces the efficiency of Comptonization and that general
relativistic effects identically cancel bulk Comptonization effects for a
free-falling flow and in the limit of infinitesimal mean-free path. As a
result, we find that neglecting the curved spacetime geometry leads to
overestimating the high-energy flux by up to an order of magnitude. Finally, we
demonstrate that the spectrum from accretion onto a neutron star depends
sensitively on the imposed boundary conditions, while that from a black hole is
immune to such choices.

with main sequence or horizontal branch stars. We estimate that with the

A yet higher degree of internal completeness could be reached at the expense of
higher contamination. However, the external completeness is limited by
additional losses caused by proper motion effects and the epoch differences

taking as interpretation of types subsets of applicative structures, as
interpretation of the intersection constructor set-theoretic inclusion, and by
taking the interpretation of the arrow constructor a' la Scott, with respect to
either any possible functionality set, or the largest one, or the least one.
  These results strengthen and generalize significantly all earlier results in
the literature, to our knowledge, in at least three respects. First of all the
inference semantics had not been considered before. Secondly, the
characterizations are all given just in terms of simple closure conditions on
the preorder relation on the types, rather than on the typing judgments
themselves. The task of checking the condition is made therefore considerably
more tractable. Lastly, we do not restrict attention just to lambda-models, but
to arbitrary applicative structures which admit an interpretation function.

expected to come on line by 2002, and clearly observable by the second
generation of detectors. Moreover, several radio pulsars, which could be deemed
to be CW sources, are found to orbit a companion star or planet, and the
LIGO/VIRGO/GEO network plans to continuously monitor such systems. We estimate
the computational costs for a search launched over the additional five
parameters describing generic elliptical orbits using match filtering
techniques. These techniques provide the optimal signal-to-noise ratio and also
a very clear and transparent theoretical framework. We provide ready-to-use
analytical expressions for the number of templates required to carry out the

how the computational cost scales with the ranges of the parameters. We also
determine the critical accuracy to which a particular parameter must be known,
so that no search is needed for it. In order to disentangle the computational
burden involved in the orbital motion of the CW source, from the other source
parameters (position in the sky and spin-down), and reduce the complexity of
the analysis, we assume that the source is monochromatic and its location in
the sky is exactly known. The orbital elements, on the other hand, are either
assumed to be completely unknown or only partly known. We apply our theoretical
analysis to Sco X-1 and the neutron stars with binary companions which are

construct a specific model based on Z_2 orbifolding and bulk Majorana masses

Relativistic Heavy--Ion Collider (RHIC), are studied in detail. In particular
the perturbative stability of the expected asymmetries in two representative
models for the (un)broken flavor structure are investigated by confronting
perturbative QCD leading order predictions of the expected asymmetries with
their next--to--leading order counterparts.

I superstring, with and without D-branes. Our argument here depends on a
precise interpretation of the 2-form abelian gauge field using KO-theory; then
the anomaly cancellation follows from a geometric form of the full
Atiyah-Singer index theorem for families of Dirac operators. This is a refined
version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. It seems that a geometric
interpretation of this mechanism-the cancellation of local and global fermion
anomalies against local and global anomalies in the electric coupling of an
abelian gauge field-always proceeds in a similar manner. For example, a
previous paper with M. Hopkins (hep-th/0002027) explains the cancellation of
anomalies in Type II with D-branes in these terms. The focal point of this
paper is a general discussion about abelian gauge fields and Dirac charge
quantization. Namely, we argue that quantization of charge is implemented in
the functional integral by interpreting abelian gauge fields as cochains in a
generalized differential cohomology theory. Our exposition includes elementary
examples as well as examples from superstring theory. The mathematical
underpinnings of differential cohomology are currently under development; we
only give a sketch here. The anomaly cancellation in Type I depends on
properties of a certain quadratic form in KO-theory, which we analyze in an
appendix written jointly with M. Hopkins. In particular, the usual equation
``Tr R^2 = Tr F^2'' is refined to an equation in the KO-theory of spacetime.

time-continuous Frobenius-Perron operator which generalizes previous
propositions. In this way, the relaxation rates as well as the chaotic
properties can be defined for the time-continuous classical dynamics on graphs.
These properties are given as the zeros of some periodic-orbit zeta functions.
We consider in detail the case of infinite periodic graphs where the particle
undergoes a diffusion process. The infinite spatial extension is taken into
account by Fourier transforms which decompose the observables and probability
densities into sectors corresponding to different values of the wave number.
The hydrodynamic modes of diffusion are studied by an eigenvalue problem of a
Frobenius-Perron operator corresponding to a given sector. The diffusion
coefficient is obtained from the hydrodynamic modes of diffusion and has the
Green-Kubo form. Moreover, we study finite but large open graphs which converge
to the infinite periodic graph when their size goes to infinity. The lifetime
of the particle on the open graph is shown to correspond to the lifetime of a
system which undergoes a diffusion process before it escapes.

oscillators are revisited. We demonstrate with typical examples that the
conditional Lyapunov exponents (CLEs) play an important role in distinguishing
between intermittent and permanent synchronizations, when the analytic
conditions for chaos synchronization are not uniformly obeyed. We show that
intermittent synchronization can occur when CLEs are very small positive or
negative values close to zero while permanent synchronization occurs when CLEs
take sufficiently large negative values. There is also strong evidence for the
fact that for permanent synchronization the time of synchronization is
relatively low while it is high for intermittent synchronization.

interacting system and a $N-1$-body quantum system with respect to the
partition function. The resulting quantum-potential is a $N-1$-body one.
Inversely the Kelbg potential is reproduced which describes quantum systems at
a quasi-classical level. The found correspondence between classical and quantum
systems allows also to approximate dense classical many body systems by lower
order quantum perturbation theory replacing Planck's constant properly by
temperature and density dependent expressions. As an example the dynamical
behaviour of an one - component plasma is well reproduced concerning the
formation of correlation energy after a disturbance utilising solely the
analytical quantum - Born result for dense degenerated Fermi systems. As a
practical guide the quantum - Bruckner parameter $r_s$ has been replaced by the
classical plasma parameter $\Gamma$ as $r_s\approx0.3 \Gamma^{3/2}$

come from time to time into a direct contact or a close vicinity of each other.
At such an instance, the chain can be regarded as a closed one and thus will
form a knot or rather a virtual knot. Several earlier studies of random
knotting demonstrated that simpler knots show their highest occurrence for
shorter random walks than more complex knots. However up to now there were no
rules that could be used to predict the optimal length of a random walk, i.e.
the length for which a given knot reaches its highest occurrence. Using
numerical simulations, we show here that a power law accurately describes the
relation between the optimal lengths of random walks leading to the formation
of different knots and the previously characterized lengths of ideal knots of
the corresponding type.

coupled to an infinite set of independent harmonic oscillators is considered;
these oscillators have a general spectral density function and are initially in
a Gaussian state. Using the influence functional formalism a formal Langevin
equation can be introduced to describe the system's fully quantum properties
even beyond the semiclassical regime. It is shown that the reduced Wigner
function for the system is exactly the formal distribution function resulting
from averaging both over the initial conditions and the stochastic source of
the formal Langevin equation. The master equation for the reduced density
matrix is then obtained in the same way a Fokker-Planck equation can always be
derived from a Langevin equation characterizing a stochastic process. We also
show that a subclass of quantum correlation functions for the system can be
deduced within the stochastic description provided by the Langevin equation. It
is emphasized that when the system is not Markovian more information can be
extracted from the Langevin equation than from the master equation.
