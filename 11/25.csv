duration and the rate of formation, with these parameters being known with
different precision for different populations. The early rate of star formation
is knowable from modelling chemical element data, the recent rate directly from
isochrone analyses of colour-magnitude data. The field halo and globular
clusters are almost exclusively old, and formed in at most a few Gyr. The outer
bulge probably formed in a short period long ago -- extant data is
inconsistent, while the inner bulge/disk is forming today, and has continued to
form over time. Only very limited data is available on the inner disk. The
outer disk near the Sun seems as old as the halo. The earliest extended disk,
which forms the thick disk today, seems to have been in place very early, an
observation which is not simply consistent with some galaxy formation models.

  Spectral Type","submitted to ApJ (21 pages, 9 figures)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Galaxy morphological and spectroscopic types should be nearly independent of
apparent magnitude in a local, magnitude-limited sample. Recent luminosity
function surveys based on morphological classification of galaxies are
substantially more successful at passing this test than surveys based on
spectroscopic classifications. Among spectroscopic classifiers, those defined
by small aperture fibers (ESP, LCRS) show far stronger systematic
classification biases than those defined by large apertures (APM). This effect
can be easily explained as an aperture bias, whereby galaxies with globally
late-type spectra are assigned earlier spectral types which depend on the
redshift and luminosity of the galaxy. The effect is demonstrated by extracting
successively larger aperture spectra from long-slit spectroscopy of nearby
galaxies. This systematic classification bias is generic, and the 2dFGRS and
SDSS surveys will show similar systematic biases in their spectral types. We
suggest several methods for correcting the problem or avoiding it altogether.
If not corrected, this aperture bias can mimic galaxy evolutionary effects and
distort estimates of the luminosity function.

the consequence of super--sonic turbulence. Super--sonic turbulence fragments
MCs into dense sheets, filaments and cores and large low density ``voids'', via
the action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as ""turbulent
fragmentation"". In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally
unstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass
distribution above one solar mass depends primarily on the power spectrum of
the turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a
magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index \beta=-1.74, consistent with
Larson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well as with new numerical and
analytic results on super--sonic turbulence, we obtain a power law mass
distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-\beta) = 1.33,
consistent with the slope of the stellar IMF. Below one solar mass, the mass
distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of a solar mass, as
observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the
densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses
is determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is
known to be approximately Log--Normal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The
intermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible
for the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of
sub--stellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in
super--sonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the
present model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude
that turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.

Its application for future devices will be impeded by several fundamental
limitations which lead to low reliability of semiconductor devices and to the
necessity of alternative dielectrics. Amorphous silicon nitride and oxynitride
are considered now as alternative to silicon oxide in future devices. One of
the unique property of amorphous silicon nitride is the electron and hole
capture by the deep traps with extremely long life time (10 years) in the
captured state (the memory effect). This property is employed in memory devices
and microprocessors in computers. Despite numerous efforts the nature of traps
responsible for the memory effect in this material is so far unclear. In this
paper we discuss the nature of such traps using the quantum-chemical
simulation. The calculations show that the defects responsible for the electron
and hole capture in amorphous silicon nitride can be the Si-Si defects created
by excess silicon atoms.

spacetime turns out to be event-incomplete. With creation from nothing,
singularities are sources of lawlessness. A straightforward way around those

then matching metrics and causal geodesics at the singularities. To this end, a

  theorem","39 pages, TeX",,,"OUMI-00-11","hep-th",,"  We try to give a qualitative description of the Godbillon-Vey class and its
relation on the one hand to the holonomy and on the other hand to the
topological entropy of a foliation, using a remarkable theorem proved recently
by G. Duminy (which still remains unpublished), relating these three notions in
the case of codim-1 foliations. Moreover we shall investigate its possible
consequences on string theory. In particular we shall present a conceptual
argument according to which the curvature of the B-field (rank two
antisymmetric tensor) of open strings might be related to the Godbillon-Vey
class using a suitable generalisation of ``Non-Abelian Geometry'' which has
just appeared in physics literature. Our starting point again is the
Connes-Douglas-Schwarz article on compactifications of matrix models to
noncommutative tori.

correspondences having these coverings vary so much that there is no
compactification of the covering dominating all of these closures.

histories may be constructed from an approximately decoherent set by small
distortions of the operators characterizing the histories. In particular, for
the case of histories of positions and momenta, this is achieved by doubling
the set of operators and then finding, amongst this enlarged set, new position
and momentum operators which commute, so decohere exactly, and which are
``close'' to the original operators. The enlarged, exactly decoherent, theory
has the same classical dynamics as the original one, and coincides with the
so-called deterministic quantum theories of the type recently studied by 't
Hooft. These results suggest that the comparison of standard and deterministic
quantum theories may provide an alternative method of characterizing emergent
classicality. A side-product is the surprising result that histories of momenta
in the quantum Brownian motion model (for the free particle in the
high-temperature limit) are exactly decoherent.
