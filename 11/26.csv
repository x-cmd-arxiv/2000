the Universe can be represented by the ratio of the total metal content to the
total gas content measured in Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems (the ``column
density weighted metallicity'' `a la Pettini). To minimize dust obscuration
effects, a DLA sample with negligible dust content is considered, namely, 50
DLAs with log N(HI) < 20.8. The global metallicity found shows clear evidence
of redshift evolution that goes from \sim1/30 solar at z\sim4.1 to solar at z
\sim 0.4. More generally, DLAs with measured heavy elements probe the ISM of
high redshift galaxies. The whole sample collected from the literature contains
75 DLAs. The metallicity is calculated adopting for the dust correction the
most general method used so far, based on models of the ISM dust depletions in
the Galaxy. The intrinsic metallicity evolution of DLA galaxies is dlog
Z(DLA)/dz \propto -0.33 +/- 0.06.

noninvertible at some points along the orbits are analyzed. It is shown that
for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, like in classical

nonoverlapping regions each one describing a nondegenerate system, causally
disconnected from each other. These surfaces are characterized by the sign of
the Liouville's flux density on them, behaving as sources or sinks of orbits.
In this latter case, once the system reaches the domain wall, it acquires a new
gauge invariance and one degree of freedom is dynamically frozen, while the
remaining degrees of freedom evolve regularly thereafter.

complexes of R-modules, which has as its homotopy category the derived category
of the ring R. This example shows that traditional homological algebra is
encompassed by Quillen's homotopical algebra. The goal of this paper is to show
that more general forms of homological algebra also fit into Quillen's
framework. Specifically, a projective class on a complete and cocomplete
abelian category A is exactly the information needed to do homological algebra
in A. The main result is that, under weak hypotheses, the category of chain
complexes of objects of A has a model category structure that reflects the
homological algebra of the projective class in the sense that it encodes the
Ext groups and more general derived functors. Examples include the ""pure
derived category"" of a ring R, and derived categories capturing relative
situations, including the projective class for Hochschild homology and
cohomology. We characterize the model structures that are cofibrantly
generated, and show that this fails for many interesting examples. Finally, we
explain how the category of simplicial objects in a possibly non-abelian
category can be equipped with a model category structure reflecting a given
projective class, and give examples that include equivariant homotopy theory
and bounded below derived categories.
