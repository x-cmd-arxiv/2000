TeV energies via pair production on the extragalactic background light (EBL)
can probe important issues in galaxy formation. We use semi-analytic models
(SAMs) of galaxy formation, set within the hierarchical structure formation
scenario, to obtain predictions of the EBL for 0.1-1000$\mu$m. SAMs incorporate
simplified physical treatments of the key processes of galaxy formation ---
including gravitational collapse and merging of dark matter halos, gas cooling
and dissipation, star formation, supernova feedback and metal production ---
and have been shown to reproduce key observations at low and high redshift.
Here we also introduce improved modelling of the spectral energy distributions
in the mid-to-far-IR arising from emission by dust grains. Assuming a flat
\lcdm cosmology with $\Omega_m=0.3$ and Hubble parameter $h=0.65$, we
investigate the consequences of variations in input assumptions such as the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the efficiency of converting cold gas
into stars. We conclude that observational studies of the absorption of
$\gamma$-rays with energies from 10s of Gev to 10s of TeV will help to
determine the EBL, and also help to explain its origin by constraining some of
the most uncertain features of galaxy formation theory, including the IMF, the
history of star formation, and the reprocessing of light by dust.

spectrograph. This is the first time that dwarf nova oscillations are detected
and resolved in the emission lines. The accretion disc is highly asymmetric
with a stronger contribution from the blue-shifted side of the disc during our
observations. The disc extends from close to the white dwarf out to the outer
regions of the primary Roche lobe.
  Continuum oscillations at 56.12s and its first harmonic at 28.06 s are most
likely to originate on the surface of a spinning white dwarf with the
fundamental period corresponding to the spin period. Balmer and Helium emission
lines oscillate with a period of 29.77s at a mean amplitude of 1.9%. The line
kinematics as well as the eclipse constraints indicate an origin in the
accretion disc at a radius of 12 R_wd. The amplitude of the emission line
oscillation modulates (0-4%) at a period of 488s, corresponding to the Kepler
period at R=12 R_wd. This modulation is due to the beating between the white
dwarf spin and the orbital motion in the disc.
  The observed emission line oscillations cannot be explained by a truncated
disc as in the intermediate polars. The observations suggest a non-axisymmetric
bulge in the disc, orbiting at 12R_wd, is required. The close correspondence
between the location of the oscillations and the circularisation radius of the
system suggests that stream overflow effects may be of relevance

Josephson junction network, the relaxation is slower than the intragranular
relaxation and, hence, it yields higher flux pinning energy U0 than the
corresponding intragranular values. Silver addition seems to have given rise to
much uniformity in the grain boundary characteristics which results in sharp
drop in the flux pinning energy since it depends on the variation of the
junction coupling energy EJ across the network. While U0 ~ 0.5 and 0.55 eV for
the parent BPSCCO and YBCO samples, respectively, in silver added (10-15 wt%)
samples the corresponding values are ~0.15 and 0.27 eV. The distribution
functions m(U) for the flux pinning energy and n(theta) for the grain boundary
mis-alignment angle(theta) have been evaluated from the experimentally observed
patterns of magnetic relaxation and variation of the grain boundary critical
fields with temperature. The distribution functions become narrower in the case
of silver added samples reflecing a reduction in the degree of disorder. The
variation of the effective vortex mass m* with the variation in the degree of
disorder is observed. Considering the width of the superconducting transition
delTc as the measure of the degree of disorder (inhomogeneity), it has been
shown that the transport critical current density Jc follows a relationship Jc

an infinite number of absorbing states and a static conserved field coupled to

models in two spacetime dimensions. Focus is put on exactly solvable models. We
begin by introducing and motivating different possible gravitational actions,
including those of generalized dilaton theories as well as of purely
geometrical, higher derivative theories with and without torsion. The relation
among them as well as to Poisson sigma models is worked out in some detail. In
the exactly solvable cases, such as pure gravity-Yang-Mills systems, the
general solution to the field equations on a global level is reviewed.
Quantization of such models is performed in the Dirac approach, where, by use
of the formulation as Poisson sigma models, all admissible physical quantum
states are obtained.

physics, notably the theory of elementary particles, which complements other
modern developments in this field. It is particularly powerful for structural
analysis but has also proven to be useful in the rigorous treatment of models.
In this contribution a non-technical survey is given with emphasis on
interesting recent developments and future perspectives. Topics covered are the
relation between the algebraic approach and conventional quantum field theory,
its significance for the resolution of conceptual problems (such as the
revision of the particle concept) and its role in the characterization and
possibly also construction of quantum field theories with the help of modular
theory. The algebraic approach has also shed new light on the treatment of
quantum field theories on curved spacetime and made contact with recent
developments in string theory (algebraic holography).
