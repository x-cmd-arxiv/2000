  http://bustard.phys.nd.edu/GEST/",,"10.1086/340977",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that a space-based gravitational microlensing survey for terrestrial
extra-solar planets is feasible in the near future, and could provide a nearly
complete picture of the properties of planetary systems in our Galaxy. We
present simulations of such a survey using a 1-2m aperture space telescope with
a ~2 square degree field-of-view which is used to continuously monitor ~10^8
Galactic bulge main sequence stars. The microlensing techniques allows the
discovery of low mass planets with high signal-to-noise, and the space mission
that we have studied are sensitive to planets with masses as low as that of
Mars. By targeting main sequence source stars, which can only be resolved from
space, the space-based microlensing survey is able to detect enough light from
the lens stars to determine the spectral type of one third of the lens stars
with detected planets, including virtually all of the F, G, and K stars which
comprise one quarter of the event sample. This enables the determination of the
planetary masses and separations in physical units, as well as the abundance of
planets as a function of stellar type and distance from the Galactic center. We
show that a space-based microlensing planet search program has its highest
sensitivity to planets at orbital separations of 0.7-10 AU, but it will also
have significant sensitivity at larger separations and will be able to detect
free-floating planets in significant numbers. This complements the planned
terrestrial planet transit missions which are sensitive to terrestrial planets
at separations of =< 1 AU. Such a mission also detect ~50,000 giant planets via
transits, and it is, therefore, the only proposed planet detection method that
is sensitive to planets at all orbital radii.

models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light
ratios (M/Ls) within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and
7 in the optical, and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Under the assumption
of a universal spiral galaxy IMF, our models show a strong and robust
correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated
stellar populations. Using observed maximum disk M/Ls we conclude that a
Salpeter Initial Mass Function (IMF) has too many low-mass stars per unit
luminosity, but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end
with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/Ls 30% or more lower than the
Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. We apply the
model trends in stellar M/L with color to the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. We
find that the stellar mass TF relation is relatively steep and has modest
scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the
stellar masses. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue)
and near-infrared TF relations is due to the combined effects of dust
attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. We find that the
baryonic TF relation has a slope of 3.5 (with random and systematic errors of
+/- 0.2 each). Since we have normalized the stellar M/L to be as high as can
possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic TF
relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially
sub-maximal. [Abridged]

strong in the low hard states like that of Cyg X-1, the QPO, when present, are
weak and broad. In their strong manifestations, these QPO have the curious
property of appearing to have the spectrum of the power-law component which

simulations carried out in the cylindrical limit in which the vertical
component of the gravitational field is neglected. The simulations use a
cylindrical pseudo-Newtonian potential to model the main dynamical properties
of the Schwarzschild metric. The disks are initially constant density with a
Keplerian angular momentum distribution and contain a weak toroidal or vertical
field. These simulations reaffirm many of the conclusions of previous local
simulations. The magnetorotational instability grows rapidly and produces MHD
turbulence with a significant Maxwell stress which drives accretion.
Tightly-wrapped low-$m$ spiral waves are prominent. In some simulations radial
variations in Maxwell stress concentrate gas into rings, creating substantial
spatial inhomogeneities. There is a nonzero stress at the marginally stable
orbit which produces a small decline in specific angular momentum inside the
last stable orbit. Detailed comparisons between simulations are used to examine
the effects of computational domain and equation of state. Simulations that
begin with vertical fields have greater field amplification and higher ratios
of stress to magnetic pressure compared with those beginning with toroidal
fields. In contrast to MHD, hydrodynamics alone neither creates nor sustains
turbulence.

with these parameters leads to the identification of two distinct regions in

A critical optical depth, tau_c, as a function of luminosity and electron

  The results are applied to black hole candidate X-ray binary systems in the

mass range A = 45 - 65 have resulted in substantial revisions to the hitherto
standard set of Fuller, Fowler, & Newman (FFN). In particular, key
electron-capture rates, such as that for Co60 are much smaller. We consider
here the effects of these revised rates on the presupernova (post-oxygen
burning) evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11 to 40 M_sun. Moreover,
we include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modern
rates for beta-decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission.
Values for the central electron mole number at the time of iron core collapse
in the new models are typically larger, by delta Y_e = 0.005 to 0.015, than
those of Woosley & Weaver 1995, with a tendency for the more massive models to
display larger differences. About half of this change is a consequence of
including beta-decay; the other half, result of the smaller rates for electron
capture. Unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger Y_e's, the
new iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the
entropy in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero
to 0.1 M_sun. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al. (1994), a
tendency towards beta-equilibrium just prior to the collapse of the core, and
the subsequent loss of that equilibrium as core collapse proceeds. We discuss
the key weak reaction rates, both beta-decay and electron-capture, responsible
for the evolution of Y_e and make suggestions for future measurements.

we performed calculations on the Lyman alpha line formation for each
evolutionary stage of an expanding supershell. The emergent Lyman alpha
profiles are characterized by the double peaks and the absorption trough at the
line center. We found that the absorption troughs expected in most of the
evolutionary stages are not wide enough to be observed with current
instruments. However, the absorption trough in the Lyman alpha emission profile
from an expanding recombining supershell can be marginally detected.

spheroid mass which is equal to the inverse of the critical Reynolds number for
the onset of turbulence in the accretion disk surrounding the central black
hole. Applying the fundamental plane correlation for spheroids, we find that
the black hole mass has a power-law dependence on the spheroid velocity
dispersion with a slope in the range of 4-5. We explain the larger scatter in
the Magorrian relation with respect to the black hole mass-spheroid velocity

consequence of the microturbulent analysis applied to the absorption spectra.
FUSE observations were performed with a large entrance aperture which fully
covered the galaxy. This means that the observed profiles are averaged over the
full body of I Zw 18, implying that large-scale velocity fields influence the
absorption - line profiles. Taking this into account, we show that the
absorption spectra are consistent with the same metal abundances as those
derived from the HII regions. It follows that no significant ionization
correction as suggested by Izotov and collaborators to describe metal contents
in damped Ly-alpha systems (DLA) is required to model abundances in the neutral
gas of I Zw 18 (a local DLA system). Using a mesoturbulent approach and
applying the generalized radiative transfer equation to the ArI1048 and

likely to be realized in bilayer quantum Hall systems at total Landau level

instability of a compressible state in the large $d/l_B$ limit, where $d$ and
$l_B$ are the interlayer distance and magnetic length, respectively. This state
has a hierarchical descendent which is interlayer coherent. Another interlayer
coherent state, which is expected in the small $d/l_B$ limit is the well-known

discuss the wavefunctions which describe these states. We construct a phase

application of conditional rewriting rules and the obtained results at the same
level of representation. We introduce the rewriting calculus, also called the
rho-calculus, which generalizes the first order term rewriting and
lambda-calculus, and makes possible the representation of the non-determinism.
In our approach the abstraction operator as well as the application operator
are objects of calculus. The result of a reduction in the rewriting calculus is
either an empty set representing the application failure, or a singleton
representing a deterministic result, or a set having several elements
representing a not-deterministic choice of results.
  In this thesis we concentrate on the properties of the rewriting calculus
where a syntactic matching is used in order to bind the variables to their
current values. We define evaluation strategies ensuring the confluence of the
calculus and we show that these strategies become trivial for restrictions of
the general rewriting calculus to simpler calculi like the lambda-calculus. The
rewriting calculus is not terminating in the untyped case but the strong
normalization is obtained for the simply typed calculus.
  In the rewriting calculus extended with an operator allowing to test the
application failure we define terms representing innermost and outermost
normalizations with respect to a set of rewriting rules. By using these terms,
we obtain a natural and concise description of the conditional rewriting.
Finally, starting from the representation of the conditional rewriting rules,
we show how the rewriting calculus can be used to give a semantics to ELAN, a
language based on the application of rewriting rules controlled by strategies.

We observe a remarkable effect, namely, that the freely hanging mirrors gain
energy continuously and swing with increasing amplitude. It is found that the
`time delay', that is, the time taken for the field to adjust to its
instantaneous equilibrium value, when the mirrors are in motion, is responsible
for this effect. This effect is likely to be important in the optimal operation

the horizon, it turns out that one ends up with exactly the same four horizon

linear Maxwell one to a highly non-linear BI one. Close inspection reveals that
this curious and unexpected result can be attributed to the fact that the

the base of $U(3)\times U(3)$ chiral symmetry. The glueball is introduced into
the meson Lagrangian by using the principle of scale invariance of an effective
Lagrangian and the dilaton model. The singlet-octet mixing of scalar meson
states is described by means of 't Hooft interaction. The contribution of the
scalar and pseudoscalar anomalies into the breaking of scale invariance is
taken into account. The mixing of quarkonia with the glueball is described. The
mass spectrum of scalar mesons together with the glueball and also their strong
decay widths are calculated. From comparing the obtained results with
experimental data, it follows that $f_0(1500)$ is rather a glueball, whereas
$f_0(1710)$ is a quarkonium. This accords with the results obtained in our

Model - the addition of just one singlet scalar field - as a minimalist model
for non-baryonic dark matter. Such a model is characterized by only three
parameters in addition to those already appearing within the Standard Model: a
dimensionless self-coupling and a mass for the new scalar, and a dimensionless
coupling, \lambda, to the Higgs field. If the singlet is the dark matter, these
parameters are related to one another by the cosmological abundance constraint,
implying that the coupling of the singlet to the Higgs field is large, \lambda
\sim O(0.1 - 1). Since this parameter also controls couplings to ordinary
matter, we obtain predictions for the elastic cross section of the singlet with
nuclei. The resulting scattering rates are close to current limits from both
direct and indirect searches. The existence of the singlet also has
implications for current Higgs searches, as it gives a large contribution to
the invisible Higgs width for much of parameter space. These scalars can be
strongly self-coupled in the cosmologically interesting sense recently proposed
by Spergel and Steinhardt, but only for very low masses (< 1 GeV), which is
possible only at the expense of some fine-tuning of parameters.

the Randall-Sundrum case as there is a discontinuity in the delta-function-like

spontaneously, while the Randall-Sundrum brane breaks diffeomorphisms
explicitly. Finally, at the quantum level both the domain wall as well as the

presence of N D3-branes, and in a certain decoupling limit, it reduces to the
functional integral of N=4 U(N) supersymmetric gauge theory for multi-instanton
solutions. We study this quantity as a function of non-commutativity in the
D3-brane theory, VEVs corresponding to separating the D3-branes and alpha'.
Explicit calculations are presented in the one-instanton sector with arbitrary
N, and in the large-N limit for all instanton charge. We find that for general
instanton charge, the matrix theory admits a nilpotent fermionic symmetry and
that the action is Q-exact. Consequently the partition function localizes on
the minima of the matrix theory action. This allows us to prove some general
properties of these integrals. In the non-commutative theory, the contributions
come from the ``Higgs Branch'' and are equal to the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern integral
of the resolved instanton moduli space. Separating the D3-branes leads to
additional localizations on products of abelian instanton moduli spaces. In the
commutative theory, there are additional contributions from the ``Coulomb
Branch'' associated to the small instanton singularities of the instanton
moduli space. We also argue that both non-commutativity and alpha'-corrections
play a similar role in suppressing the contributions from these singularities.
Finally we elucidate the relation between the partition function and the Euler
characteristic of the instanton moduli space.

reduce the norm of u by a random coordinate restriction, how to approximate u

subspaces where u is an isomorphism. The first problem in this list provides a
probabilistic extension of a suppression theorem of Kashin and Tzafriri, the
second one is a new look at a result of Rudelson on the random vectors in the
isotropic position, the last one is the recent generalization of the
Bourgain-Tzafriri's invertibility principle. The main point is that all the
results are independent of n, the situation is instead controlled by the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of u. As an application, we provide an almost optimal
solution to the problem of harmonic density in harmonic analysis, and a
solution to the reconstruction problem for communication networks which deliver

the emphasis is on the relative importance of two-body contributions from
hadronic rescattering and electromagnetic meson exchange currents besides the
impulse approximation. For the elementary photoproduction amplitude a coupled
resonance model developed by Bennhold and Tanabe has been used which fits
reasonably well the experimental data. The rescattering effects are treated
within a coupled channel approach considering the intermediate excitation of
the $P_{11}(1440)$, $D_{13}(1520)$, and $S_{11}(1535)$ nucleon resonances. The
hadronic interaction between nucleon and resonances is modeled by one boson
exchange potentials, which we have considered both in the static approximation
as well as fully retarded. The sum of all considered two-body effects results
in an enhancement of the total cross section between 10 in the maximum and 25
percent closer to threshold around 680 MeV if the hadronic interaction is
treated retarded. This enhancement shows up in the differential cross sections
mainly at backward angles. It increases steadily from only a few percent at
$0^\circ$ to more than a factor two at $180^\circ$ for a photon energy of 680
MeV. Two-body effects become also significant in certain polarization
observables. Finally, no discrepancy has been found for the ratio of the
isoscalar amplitude to the proton amplitude between coherent and incoherent
$\eta$-photoproduction on the deuteron due to a nonvanishing complex and energy
dependent phase relation.

the evolution of a $K^0\bar{K}^0$ quantum entangled pair (created in the decay
of the $\phi$-meson) are discussed. It is shown, in agreement with Bell's
theorem, that the most general local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing
the whole set of quantum-mechanical joint probabilities. We achieve these
conclusion by employing two different approaches. In a first one the local
realistic observables are deduced from the most general premises concerning
locality and realism, and Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other
approach makes use of Bell's inequalities. Within the former scheme, under
particular conditions for the detection times, the discrepancy between quantum
mechanics and local realism for the time-dependent asymmetry turns out to be
not less than 20%. The same incompatibility can be made evident by means of a
Bell-type test by employing both Wigner's and (once properly normalized
probabilities are used) Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Holt's inequalities. Because of
the relatively low experimental accuracy, the data obtained by the CPLEAR
collaboration for the asymmetry parameter do not allow for a decisive test of
local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's
inequalities, should be feasible in the future at the Frascati $\Phi$-factory.
