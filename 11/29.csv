consists of six images of a single z_s=3.235 radio source and its star-forming
host galaxy, produced by a compact group of galaxies at z_l = 1. VLBA
observations at 1.7 GHz strongly support this conclusion, showing six compact
cores with similar low-frequency radio spectra. B1359+154 is the first example
of galaxy-scale gravitational lensing in which more than four images are
observed of the same background source. The configuration is due to the unique
lensing mass distribution: three primary lens galaxies lying on the vertices of
a triangle separated by 0.7 arcsec (4/h kpc), inside the 1.7 arcsec diameter
Einstein ring defined by the radio images. The gravitational potential has
additional extrema within this triangle, creating a pair of central images that
supplement the ``standard'' four-image geometry of the outer components. Simple
mass models consisting of three lens galaxies constrained by HST and VLBA
astrometry naturally reproduce the observed image positions but must be
finely-tuned to fit the flux densities.

  Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal, March 2001 issue",,"10.1086/319407",,"astro-ph",,"  We present HST NICMOS photometry of the resolved stellar population in NGC
1569. The CMD in the F110W and F160W photometric bands contains ~2400 stars
with a formal photometric error < 0.1 mag down to J~23.5 and H~22.5. We
describe the data processing which is required to calibrate the instrumental
peculiarities of NICMOS. Two different packages for PSF-fitting photometry are
used to strengthen the photometric results in the crowded stellar field of NGC
1569. The resulting CMD is discussed in terms of the major evolutionary
properties of the resolved stellar populations. For a distance modulus of 26.71
and a reddening E(B-V)=0.56, our CMD samples stars down to ~0.8 Mo,
corresponding to look-back times > 15 Gyr. This is clear indication of SF
activity spanning an entire Hubble time. The metallicity of the reddest RGB
stars is in better agreement with Z=0.004 as measured in HII regions, than with
Z=0.0004 as expected from the stellar ages. The presence of - yet undetected -
very metal-poor stars embedded in the stellar distribution around J=22.75 and
J-H=1.15 is, however, not ruled out. The youngest stars (< 50 Myr) are
preferentially found around the two central super star clusters, whereas the
oldest population has a more uniform spatial distribution. A SFR per unit area
of 1 Mo yr*(-1) kpc*(-2) and a mass formed in stars of ~ 1.4x10*6 Mo in the
last 50 Myr are derived from the CMD. The NIR CMD places strong constraints on
the lower limit of the onset of SF in NGC 1569. The exceptionally high crowding
in the NICMOS images of NGC 1569 is a challenge for the photometric analysis.
As a result, optical and NIR images of NGC 1569 sample different populations
and cannot be cross-correlated. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the consistency of
the SF histories derived from the optical and NIR CMDs.

state, spin rates and mass of the compact object have been computed. The
analysis involves the computation of the relativistically corrected radial
temperature profiles and the effect of Doppler and gravitational red-shifts on
the spectra. Light bending effects have been omitted for simplicity. The
relativistic spectrum is compared with the Newtonian one and it is shown that
the difference between the two is primarily due to the different radial
temperature profile for the relativistic and Newtonian disk solutions.
  To facilitate direct comparison with observations, a simple empirical
function has been presented which describes the numerically computed
relativistic spectra well. This empirical function (which has three parameters
including normalization) also describes the Newtonian spectrum adequately. Thus
the function can in principle be used to distinguish between the two. In
particular, the best fit value of one of the parameters ($\beta$-parameter)
$\approx 0.4$ for the Newtonian case, while it ranges from 0.1 to 0.35 for
relativistic case depending upon the inclination angle, EOS, spin rate and mass
of the neutron star. Constraining this parameter by fits to future
observational data of X-ray binaries will indicate the effect of strong gravity
in the observed spectrum.

3C~264 must have merged a long time (a few billion years or more) ago but their
remnant elliptical galaxies only recently (last tens of millions of years or
less) become active in radio. Instead, we argue that the cannibalism of

their observed disturbances, these galaxies probably become active in radio
soon after the accretion event when sufficient molecular gas agglomerates in

where the repulsive force of dark energy starts to dominate over the gravity of
a mass concentration. For the Local Group $r_Q$ is about 1.5 Mpc. Intriguingly,
at the same distance 1.5 Mpc the linear and very ""cold"" Hubble flow emerges,
with about the global Hubble constant. We also consider the critical epoch
$t_Q$, when the DE antigravity began to dominate over the local matter gravity
for a galaxy which at the present epoch is in the local DE dominated region.
Our main result is that the homogeneous dark energy component, revealed by SNIa
observations, resolves the old confrontation between the local Hubble flow and
local highly non-uniform, fractal matter distribution. It explains why the
Hubble law starts on the outskirts of the Local Group, with the same Hubble
constant as globally and with a remarkably small velocity dispersion.

found another X-ray source, AX J2050.0+2941, at the north east of AX
  J2049.6+2939. During the three ASCA observations, the X-ray intensity of AX
J2050.0+2941 varied by a factor of $\simeq$4. No coherent pulsations could be
found for AX J2050.0+2941.
  We have performed optical photometric and spectroscopic observations in the
vicinity of AX J2049.6+2939 at the Kitt Peak National Observatory
  (KPNO). As a result, all objects brighter than $B$-band magnitude of 22 in
the error box can be identified with normal stars. Combined with the
  X-ray results and the fact that there are no radio counterparts, AX
  J2049.6+2939 is not likely to be either an ordinary rotation-powered pulsar
or an AGN. The nature of AX J2049.6+2939 is still unclear and further
observations over a wide energy band are strongly required.
  As to AX J2050.0+2941, the long-term X-ray variability and the radio
counterpart suggests that it is an AGN.

of candidate and confirmed damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLAS). The derived
spin temperatures (T_s) are in all cases $\sim 1000$ K or higher. We have also
collated from the literature a list of DLAS for which 21cm observations exist,
and discuss their implications for the nature of the absorbers.
  A cross-comparison of the 21cm profiles with low ionization metal profiles
shows that the 21cm absorption coincides in velocity with the deepest metal
line feature. This is consistent with models in which the deep metal line
features arise from discrete clouds but not with models where the deepest
features are the result of velocity crowding.
  We also find that the typical derived spin temperatures of DLAS are
considerably higher than those in the Galaxy or nearby spirals. The only
exceptions are DLAS which are known to be associated with the disks of spirals;
these do, in fact, show low spin temperatures. In a multi-phase medium,the
derived T_s is a weighted average of the temperatures of the individual phases.
High derived T_s values are hence to be expected from small, low metallicity
objects, since these objects should have a lower fraction of the cold phase in
their ISM as compared to large galaxies. The high T_s in DLAS is hence
consistent with their observed low metallicities as well as with recent
observations that DLAS are also associated with dwarf/LSB galaxies. Finally, we
suggest that the following trend may be identified: at low redshift, damped
absorption arises from a range of systems, including spiral galaxy disks,
while, at high redshift, absorption occurs predominantly in smaller systems.

physics of the plasma outflow in the magnetosphere of rotating objects. In
comparison to the axisymmetric outflow, two new affects appear: more efficient
magnetocentrifugal acceleration of the plasma along particular field lines and
generation of MHD waves. Here, we use an ideal MHD approximation to study the
dynamics of a cold wind in the nonaxisymmetric magnetosphere. We obtain a
self-consistent analytical solution of the problem of cold plasma outflow from
a slowly rotating star with a slightly nonaxisymmetric magnetic field using
perturbation theory. In the axisymmetric (monopole-like) magnetic field, the
first term in the expansion of the terminating energy of the plasama in powers
of $\Omega$ is proportional to $\Omega^4$, where $\Omega$ is the angular
velocity of the central source. Violation of the axial symmetry of the magnetic
field crucially changes this dependence. The first correction to the energy of
the plasma becomes proportional to $\Omega$. Efficient magnetocentrifugal
acceleration occurs along the field lines curved initially in the direction of
the rotation. I argue that all necessary conditions for the efficient
magnetocentrifugal acceleration of the plasma exist in the radio pulsar

from Mrk 348 remained relatively steady. However this was followed by a
significant brightening of the source (by roughly a factor of 4) with the
fastest change corresponding to a doubling of its X-ray flux on a timescale of
about 20 days. The flux increase was accompanied by a marked softening of X-ray
spectrum most likely attributable to a factor 3 decline in the intrinsic
line-of-sight column density. In contrast the iron line and the reflection

scenario in which the central X-ray source is surrounded by a patchy
distribution of absorbing material located within about a light-week of the
nucleus of Mrk 348. The random movement of individual clouds within the

variations in the measured column density on timescales of weeks to months and

optically-thin emission from an extended plasma (with a luminosity of 2% of the

their origin in an optically-thick accretion disk extending relatively close to

and an anisotropic one, alpha^{2}F(Omega)_{an}, such that

effect of non-magnetic impurities on the theoretical tunneling conductance
curves at T=4 K for all the symmetries considered.

considering the field orientation-dependence of the sign and phase of the
fundamental $\alpha$ frequency, at fields both well above and below the kink
transition field, it is found that a single value for the product of the
effective mass with the electron {\it g}-factor can explain the experimental
data deep within both the high magnetic field and low magnetic field phases.
This implies that spin-splitting does not occur within the low magnetic field
phase until the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the
conducting planes is $\sim$~42$^\circ$. This finding contrasts greatly with
that recently published by Sasaki and Fukase, implying that electron-electron
interactions do not play a significant role in the formation of the
charge-density wave ground state. The manner in which the amplitude of the
waveform of the oscillations is damped within the low magnetic field phase is
indicative of a non harmonically indexed reduction of the amplitude, thereby
eliminating both magnetic breakdown and impurity scattering as dominant damping
mechanisms within this phase. Meanwhile, the presence of a large amplitude
second harmonic within the low magnetic field phase that has a negative sign
over a broad range of angles can only be explained by the frequency doubling
effect.

function of two governing parameters, the initial degree of pinning of the
matrix grains by the particles and the initial size advantage of the anomalous
grain. In such conditions, moderate growth is obtained whose specific features

techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency.
Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also
less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic
programming systems are small according to general standards within the data
mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that
several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled
independently.
  Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic
programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing
ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context
of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and
to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations
corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the
expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a
large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).
  As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system
Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which
loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by
one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can
handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed
scales up linearly in the number of examples.

used to sum Sudakov logarithms in inclusive B -> X_s gamma and B -> X_u \ell nu

percolation is estimated from expectations coming from the study of heavy ion
collisions at high energies. We interpret this onset as an indication of
saturation of the density of partons in the wave function of the hadron. In
order to produce quantitative results, a particular model fitted to describe
present HERA data and generalized to the nuclear case is used. Nevertheless,
with the number of scatterings controlled by the relation between inclusive and
diffractive processes, conclusions are weakly model-dependent as long as
different models are tuned to describe the experimental data. This constitutes
a new approach, based on the eikonal description of soft hadronic collisions,
and different from others which employ either perturbative QCD ideas or
semiclassical methods. It offers an alternative picture for saturation in the
small $Q^2$ region.

spectrum and polarization of colliding photons, produced by Compton
back-scattering of laser light off incoming e- beams, we find that a
gamma-gamma collider is most powerful when new physics appears in the neutral
spin-zero channel at an invariant mass below about 80% of the c.m. energy of
the colliding e-e- system. If a light Higgs boson exists, its properties can be
studied in detail, and if its heavier partners or a heavy Higgs boson exists in
the above mass range, they may be discovered at a gamma-gamma collider. CP
property of the scalar sector can be explored in detail by making use of linear
polarization of the colliding photons, decay angular correlations of final
state particles, and the pattern of interference with the Standard model
amplitudes. A few comments are given for SUSY particle studies at a gamma-gamma
collider, where a pair of charged spinless particles is produced in the s-wave

mode may measure the Higgs-Z-gamma coupling accurately and probe flavor
oscillations in the slepton sector. As a general remark, all the Standard Model

so that simulation can be performed for an arbitrary set of Stokes parameters

regularization, one may take one-half the result for the mass of a widely
separated kink-antikink (or sphaleron) system, where the two bosonic zero modes
count as two degrees of freedom, but the two fermionic zero modes as only one
degree of freedom in the sums over modes. For a single kink, there is one
bosonic zero mode degree of freedom, but it is necessary to average over four
sets of fermionic boundary conditions in order (i) to preserve the fermionic
Z$_2$ gauge invariance $\psi \to -\psi$, (ii) to satisfy the basic principle of
mode regularization that the boundary conditions in the trivial and the kink
sector should be the same, (iii) in order that the energy stored at the
boundaries cancels and (iv) to avoid obtaining a finite, uniformly distributed
energy which would violate cluster decomposition. The average number of
fermionic zero-energy degrees of freedom in the presence of the kink is then
indeed 1/2. For boundary conditions leading to only one fermionic zero-energy
solution, the Z$_2$ gauge invariance identifies two seemingly distinct `vacua'
as the same physical ground state, and the single fermionic zero-energy
solution does not correspond to a degree of freedom. Other boundary conditions
lead to two spatially separated $\omega \sim 0 $ solutions, corresponding to

$B \ll Z^2$, in accordance with a result of V. Ivrii on the quantum mechanical

band. We consider modifications of the Thomas-Fermi theory for strong magnetic
fields (STF), i.e. for $B \ll Z^3$. The main modification consists in replacing
the integration over the variables perpendicular to the field by an expansion
in angular momentum eigenfunctions in the lowest Landau band. This leads to a
functional (DSTF) depending on a sequence of one-dimensional densities. For a
one-dimensional Fermi gas the analogue of a Weizs\""acker correction has a
negative sign and we discuss the corresponding modification of the DSTF
functional.

Furthermore, Y is a subspace of Y'. We define a G(K)-equivariant map I that
maps each point x in Y' to a convex subset I(x) of the affine building B of the
group G(K).
  The map I is used to construct a compactification Z of Y in the following
sense. The rigid analytic space Z is the generic fibre of a formal scheme over
Spf(R) such that the closed fibre of the formal scheme consists of proper
components that correspond 1-1 to the vertices of the building. Here R denotes
the ring of integers of the field K. The space Z contains Y and is itself
contained in Y'. Furthermore, some parabolic subgroup P of G(K) acts on Z (but
G(K) itself does not act on Z, unless Z=Y=Y'). In fact, one can describe Z as
the set of points x in X that are stable for all maximal K-split tori S of G
that are contained in P, using the restriction to S of a suitable
P-linearisation of the line bundle L.

which is necessary to account for the time-dependent Saffman-Taylor finger

radial geometries, the explicit results provide relevant analytical information
about the role that the viscosity contrast and the surface tension play in the

agreement between the low order approximations and the exact solution is
excellent within the radius of convergence, and reasonably good even beyond

  Tadi\'c","Hypernuclear Weak Decay Puzzle","44 pages, 2 eps figures, revtex, to appear in Phys. Rev. C",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  A general shell model formalism for the nonmesonic weak decay of the
hypernuclei has been developed. It involves a partial wave expansion of the
emitted nucleon waves, preserves naturally the antisymmetrization between the
escaping particles and the residual core, and contains as a particular case the
weak $\Lambda$-core coupling formalism. The Extreme Particle-Hole Model and the
Quasiparticle Tamm-Dancoff Approximation are explicitly worked out. It is shown
that the nuclear structure manifests itself basically through Pauli Principle,
and a very simple expression is derived for the neutron and proton induced
decays rates, $\Gamma_n$ and $\Gamma_p$, which does not involve the
spectroscopic factors. We use the standard strangeness-changing weak $\Lambda
N\to NN$ transition potential which comprises the exchange of the complete
pseudoscalar and vector meson octets ($\pi,\eta,K,\rho,\omega,K^*$), taking
into account some important parity violating transition operators that are
systematically omitted in the literature. The interplay between different
mesons in the decay of ${^{12}_\Lambda C}$ is carefully analyzed. With the
commonly used parametrization in the One-Meson-Exchange Model (OMEM), the
calculated rate $\Gamma_{NM}= \Gamma_n+\Gamma_p$ is of the order of the free
$\Lambda$ decay rate $\Gamma^0(\Gamma_{NM}^{\rm th}\cong \Gamma^0)$ and is
consistent with experiments. Yet, the measurements of
$\Gamma_{n/p}=\Gamma_n/\Gamma_p$ and of $\Gamma_p$ are not well accounted for
by the theory ($\Gamma_{n/p}^{\rm th}\lsim 0.42; \Gamma_p^{\rm th}\gsim 0.60
\Gamma^0$). It is suggested that, unless additional degrees of freedom are
incorporated, the OMEM parameters should be radically modified.

presence of MeV particle increases up to latitudes above 60 degrees, well
outside the CIR belt but associated in time with the regular passage of these
plasma interfaces at more equatorial latitudes. The particle increases have
been explained variously as due to diffusion from a field line connection with
a CIR at a greater distance, perpendicular diffusion in latitude, propagation
from the inner Corona or an acceleration process on a connecting field line.
Numerical solutions to the 1-D propagation equation upstream of a CIR shock for
reasonable diffusion mean free paths are shown here to limit the source of the
increases to within about 2 AU of the CIR's, asssuming the CIR's either trap or
accelerate energetic particles and they diffuse from the nearby CIR interface.
The problem of allowing propagation from the CIR's is eased if the CIRs are
located according to the predictions for the current sheet with a solar source
surface at $2.5 R_{s}$, rather than at $3.25 R_{s}$. Energetic electron
observations showing delays with respect to the CIR-associated ions suggest
possibly an acceleration in the inner corona, rather than in the CIR-associated
shock. A more likely explanation, however, is the ability of electrons to take
a longer a longer route, from beyond the point of observation, than for that of
the ions and yet arrive within a few days of CIR closest approach time.

space how to curve and space tells mass how to move. Newtonian gravity equation
makes a distinction between them by having its numerator as mass effect and its
denominator as inverse square law space effect at macroscopic approximation. At
microscopic distances it makes sense to substitute surface-to-surface distance
between two nucleons for center-to-center distance between them to account for
the mass space distinction, keeping in mind the smallest distance between
coupled nucleons is Planck length. Any distance less than Planck makes no sense
in the classical world. When we calculate the force between two nucleons of one
femtometer diameter each, separated by a surface-to-surface distance of Planck
length, we get the force that matches well known nuclear force i.e. 10E40 times
the value of the force of gravitation ``g'' calculated by assuming the
Newtonian center-to-center distance of 1 femtometer. What we get is what is
described as the nuclear force in scientific literature. This leads to the
question: Is the nuclear force (well recognized secondary effect of color
force) high intensity gravitation?
