produced by cooling of the gas from the intracluster medium. The filament, much

photo-ionization models alone. Models of line ratios in NGC 5775 require a
greater contribution from shocks for filamentary regions than for
non-filamentary regions to explain the run of [OIII]/Halpha. In either case,
the [SII]/[NII] ratio is not well fit by the models. Composite models for UGC
10288 are successful at reproducing the run of [SII]/[NII] for all but the the
highest values of [NII]/Halpha; however, the run of [OIII]/Halpha vs.
[NII]/Halpha does not show any discernible trend, making it difficult to
determine whether or not shocks make a contribution.
  We also examine whether the data can be explained simply by an increase in
temperature with z in a pure photo-ionization model. Runs of [SII]/Halpha,

such an increase. However, the runs of [OIII]/Halpha vs. z in NGC 5775 and UGC

explained without invoking a secondary ionization source or at the very least a
much higher temperature for the [OIII]-emitting component than for the [SII]-

more successful at explaining the [OIII]/Halpha run in NGC 891.

the new broad-band imaging data not only show flux measurements of this galaxy

with which the new parallaxes place individual Hyades members in the Hertz-

softened to reduce the shot noise. Softening modifies gravity at r=|x-y|
smaller than softening length epsilon and the softened forces are increasingly
biased for ever larger epsilon. There is, thus, some optimum between reducing
the fluctuations and introducing a bias. Here, analytical relations are derived
for the amplitudes of the bias and the fluctuations in the limit of small
epsilon and large N. It is shown that the fluctuations of the force are
generated locally, in contrast to the variations of the potential, which
originate from noise in the whole system. Based on the asymptotic relations and
using numerical experiments, I study the dependence of the resulting force
error on N, epsilon, and on the functional form by which Newtonian gravity is
replaced. The Plummer softening, where each body is replaced by a Plummer
sphere of scale radius epsilon, yields significantly larger force errors than
do methods in which the bodies are replaced by density kernels of finite
extent. I also give special kernels, which reduce the errors even further.
These kernels largely compensate the errors made with too small inter-particle
forces at r<epsilon by exceeding Newtonian forces at r epsilon. Additionally,
the possibilities of locally adapting epsilon and of using unequal weights for
the bodies are investigated. These various techniques allow, without increasing
N, to reduce the rms force error by a factor 2 compared to Plummer softening
with constant epsilon. The results of this study are directly relevant to
N-body simulations using direct summation techniques or the tree code.

Lensing on 160-300 mas scales is expected to arise predominantly from spiral

conclude that none of them are likely to be detected. Our null result enables
us formally to rule out a cosmologically significant population of
uniformly-distributed compact objects: Omega (CO)<0.1 (95% confidence) in the

g-modes and p-modes. The g-modes involve long leading and long trailing waves,
have properties determined by the self-gravity of the disk, and are only
present in narrow rings or in disks where the precession rate is dominated by
an external potential. In contrast, the properties of p-modes are determined by
the interplay of self-gravity and other collective effects. P-modes involve
both long and short waves, and in the WKB approximation appear in degenerate
leading/trailing pairs. Disks support a finite number---sometimes zero---of
discrete slow modes, and a continuum of singular modes.

multiple scattering are included. The dust scattering, absorbing, and emitting
properties are calculated from realistic dust models derived by fitting
observed extinction curves in Local Group galaxies including the Magellanic

accounted for, allowing the treatment of high optical depths, by treating
photons emitted by the dust as an additional heating source and adopting an
iterative radiative transfer scheme. As an illustrative case, we apply the
DIRTY radiative transfer code to starburst galaxies wherein the heating sources
are derived from stellar evolutionary synthesis models. Within the context of

  Dec. 7 2000",,"10.1038/35047030",,"cond-mat",,"  The dynamical behavior of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a gas with
attractive interactions is striking. Quantum theory predicts that BEC of a
spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a
conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a
trap, however, such a condensate can form provided that its occupation number
does not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a
balance between self-attraction and a repulsion arising from position-momentum
uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit,
self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to
collapse. Growth of the condensate, therefore, is punctuated by intermittent
collapses, which are triggered either by macroscopic quantum tunneling or
thermal fluctuation. Previous observation of growth and collapse has been
hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we reduce the
stochasticity by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a
two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state. This enables us to obtain
the first direct observation of the growth of a condensate with attractive
interactions and its subsequent collapse.

unique possibility of directly assessing higher-twist effects. In our former

with lower-dimensional operators was ignored. However, the twist-three operator
which gives rise to the matrix element d_2 mixes non-perturbatively with an

the very heavy top and bottom squarks of focus point supersymmetry naturally

fermion sign problem and can be simulated on the lattice using present-day
techniques. We solve this theory analytically in two limits: low mu_I where
chiral perturbation theory is applicable, and asymptotically high mu_I where
perturbative QCD is at work. At low isospin density the ground state is a
superfluid pion condensate. At very high density it is a Fermi liquid with
Cooper pairing. The pairs carry the same quantum numbers as the pions.
Motivated by this observation, we put forward a conjecture that the transition
from hadron to quark matter is smooth. The conjecture passes several nontrivial
tests. Our results imply a nontrivial phase diagram in the space of temperature
and chemical potentials of isospin and baryon number. At asymtotically large
values of mu_I and small values of baryon chemical potential the ground state
is in a phase similar to Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. It is
characterized by a spatially modulated superfluid order parameter
<ubar*gamma_5*d> and may be the asymptotic limit of the inhomogeneous pion
condensation phase advocated by Migdal and others.

the absence of ghost degrees of freedom, and the decoupling properties needed
to prove factorization theorems in high momentum transfer inclusive and
exclusive reactions. We present a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory
following the Dirac method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion
based on LF-time-ordered products. The free theory gauge field is shown to
satisfy the Lorentz condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone
gauge condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect to both
its four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction Hamiltonian of QCD
can be expressed in a form resembling that of covariant theory, except for
additional instantaneous interactions which can be treated systematically. The
renormalization constants in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity
$Z_1=Z_3$ at one loop order. The QCD $\beta$ function computed in the
noncovariant light-cone gauge agrees with that known in the conventional
framework. Some comments on the relationship of our LF framework, with the
doubly transverse gauge propagator, to the analytic effective charge and
renormalization scheme defined by the pinch technique, the unitarity relations
and the spectral representation are also made. LF quantization thus provides a
consistent formulation of gauge theory, despite the fact that the hyperplanes

constraints following from limits on the scaling dimensions of gauge-invariant
operators, positivity of central charges, and Cardy's conjectured constraint on
the flow of the Euler coefficient in the stress tensor trace anomaly. Also, we
prove that if ultraviolet-stable fixed points do exist, they cannot occur in
the perturbative regime of a renormalizable model, and that all-orders results

inconclusive. However, we argue that the general idea of ultraviolet-stable

ambiguities of the theoretical parameters. Three generations of neutrinos are
considered. The parameters whose ambiguities are considered are the differences
of the squared masses, the mixing angles, and the density of matter.
  We first consider the statistics that are sensitive to the genuine
CP-violation effect originating from the imaginary coupling. No ambiguity of
the parameters is considered in this part. It is argued that the widely-adopted
usual statistics are not necessarily sensitive to the genuine CP-violation
effect. Two statistics that are sensitive to the imaginary coupling are
proposed. The qualitative difference between these statistics and the usual one
are discussed.
  Next we proceed to the case where the ambiguity of the parameters is present.
The sensitivity of the CP-violation search is greatly spoiled when the baseline
length is longer than about one thousand kilometers, which turns out to be due
to the ambiguity of the matter effect. Thus the CP-violation search by use of
CP conjugate channels turns out to require a low energy neutrino and short
baseline length. It is also shown that such a loss of sensitivity is avoided by
using T-conjugate oscillation channels.

to impose a global N = 2 SUSY on the inflaton sector. What we find is that the

inflation model. The flat potential at the tree level is not our choice of
parameters but a result of the symmetry. We further introduce a cut-off scale
of the theory which is lower than the Planck scale. This lower cut-off scale
suppresses the supergravity loop corrections to the flat inflaton potential.

the observed value of $\Lambda$ and the large values suggested by particle
physics models. The second problem is the ""time coincidence"" between the epoch
of galaxy formation $t_G$ and the epoch of $\Lambda$-domination $t_\L$. It is
conceivable that the ""old"" problem can be resolved by fundamental physics
alone, but we argue that in order to explain the ""time coincidence"" we must
account for anthropic selection effects. Our main focus here is on the
discrete-$\Lambda$ models in which $\Lambda$ can change through nucleation of
branes. We consider the cosmology of this type of models in the context of
inflation and discuss the observational constraints on the model parameters.
The issue of multiple brane nucleation raised by Feng {\it et. al.} is
discussed in some detail. We also review continuous-$\L$ models in which the
role of the cosmological constant is played by a slowly varying potential of a
scalar field. We find that both continuous and discrete models can in principle
solve both cosmological constant problems, although the required values of the
parameters do not appear very natural. M-theory-motivated brane models, in
which the brane tension is determined by the brane coupling to the four-form
field, do not seem to be viable, except perhaps in a very tight corner of the
parameter space. Finally, we point out that the time coincidence can also be
explained in models where $\Lambda$ is fixed, but the primordial density
contrast $Q=\delta\rho/\rho$ is treated as a random variable.

framework along the lines of Wheeler, 't Hooft and Susskind, with an additional

normally to black holes. This results in corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking

tables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the exact count of primitive
unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all
points of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The
168 are arranged in point-set quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of
diagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which zero-divides
only one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are
multiplicatively organized in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of
Assessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle crossover logic of
trefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral
vertex structure we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition

complete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for

framework is presented for the calculation of proton and neutron
electromagnetic form factors. Results for charge radii, magnetic moments, and
electric as well as magnetic form factors are produced using the wave functions
obtained in the so-called Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model. All
the predictions are found in remarkable agreement with existing experimental
data.

fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) can, under certain circumstances, be
appropriately represented as a real \emph{internal} 2-vector, the mathematical
``machinery'' implicit in the associated internal 2-space is shown to apply to
\emph{all} fundamental fermions. In particular, it is shown that \emph{flavor
eigenstates}, \emph{flavor doublets} and \emph{families} of fundamental
fermions can all be represented in the 2-space, and that such things as
internal \emph{colors}, \emph{family replication}, and the observed
\emph{number} (three) of families, are more-or-less implicit in the new 2-space
description. Moreover, the model predicts that, unlike the case in the standard
model, particles such as the $u$, $c$ and $t$ quarks are characterized by
significant internal (topological and other) differences. Similar differences
may help explain recent observations of (nearly) maximal $\nu_{\mu}-\nu_{\tau}$
mixing.

determines the angle phi that the wave surface makes with the horizontal. The
independent variable s is a suitably scaled velocity potential, evaluated at
the free surface, with the origin corresponding to the crest of the wave. For
all waves, except for amplitudes near the maximum, phi satisfies the inequality
mod(phi) is less than pi/6. It has been shown numerically and analytically,
that as the wave amplitude approaches its maximum, the maximum of phi can
exceed pi/6 by about 1% near the crest. Numerical evidence suggested that this
occurs in a small boundary layer near the crest where mod(phi(s)) rises rapidly
from zero and oscillates about pi/6, the number of oscillations increasing as
the maximum amplitude is approached. McLeod derived, from Nekrasov's equation,
an integral equation for phi in the boundary layer, whose width tends to zero
as the maximum wave is approached. He also conjectured the asymptotic form of
the oscillations of mod(phi(s)) about pi/6 as s tends to infinity. We solve
McLeod's boundary layer equation numerically and verify the asymptotic form of
phi.

improvements: (a) the resulting inequality is stronger because it includes the
covariance between the two observables, and (b) the proof lifts certain
restrictions on the state to which the relation is applied, increasing its
generality. The restrictions necessary for the standard inequality to apply are
not widely known, and they are discussed in detail. The classical analog of the
Heisenberg relation is also derived, and the two are compared. Finally, the
modified relation is used to address the apparent paradox that eigenfunctions
of the z component of angular momentum L_z do not satisfy the \phi-L_z
Heisenberg relation; the resolution is that the restrictions mentioned above
make the usual inequality inapplicable to these states. The modified relation
does apply, however, and it is shown to be consistent with explicit
calculations.

Lett., Vol. 86, 5184-7 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.5184",,"quant-ph",,"  A remarkable feature of quantum entanglement is that an entangled state of
two parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), may be more disordered locally than
globally. That is, S(A) > S(A,B), where S(.) is the von Neumann entropy. It is
known that satisfaction of this inequality implies that a state is
non-separable. In this paper we prove the stronger result that for separable
states the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system AB is
majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system A alone.
This gives a strong sense in which a separable state is more disordered
globally than locally and a new necessary condition for separability of
bipartite states in arbitrary dimensions. We also investigate the extent to
which these conditions are sufficient to characterize separability, exhibiting
examples that show separability cannot be characterized solely in terms of the
local and global spectra of a state. We apply our conditions to give a simple
proof that non-separable states exist sufficiently close to the completely
mixed state of $n$ qudits.

way of computing everything. The former derives from generalizations of
traditional computability, Solomonoff's algorithmic probability, Kolmogorov
complexity, and objects more random than Chaitin's Omega, the latter from
Levin's universal search and a natural resource-oriented postulate: the
cumulative prior probability of all x incomputable within time t by this
optimal algorithm should be 1/t. Between both Ps we find a universal
cumulatively enumerable measure that dominates traditional enumerable measures;
any such CEM must assign low probability to any universe lacking a short

inductive reasoning, quantum physics, philosophy, and the expected duration of
our universe.
