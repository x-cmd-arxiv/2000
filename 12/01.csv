hence their designation as anomalous. Unlike binary X-ray pulsars, no
companions are seen, so the energy cannot be supplied by accretion of matter
from a companion star. The loss of rotational energy, which powers radio
pulsars, is insufficient to power AXPs. Two models are generally considered:
accretion from a large disk left over from the birth process, or decay of a
very strong magnetic field (10^15 G) associated with a 'magnetar'. The lack of
counterparts at other wavelengths has hampered progress in our understanding of
these objects. Here, we present deep optical observations of the field around
4U 0142+61, which is the brightest AXP in X-rays. We find an object with
peculiar optical colours at the position of the X-ray source, and argue that it
is the optical counterpart. The optical emission is too faint to admit the
presence of a large accretion disk, but may be consistent with magnetospheric
emission from a magnetar.

North is unstable to overall gravitational collapse in agreement with evidence
that the halo is collapsing onto the W49A North ring of HII regions.

motivated and numerically validated analytic expressions to describe
trans-relativistic blast waves in supernovae. We find that relativistic ejecta
are enhanced in more centrally condensed envelopes, e.g., for radiative
envelopes, when the luminosity approaches the Eddington limit. We present
convenient formulae for estimating the relativistic ejecta from a given
progenitor. We apply our analytic and numerical methods to a model of SN
1998bw, finding significantly enhanced relativistic ejecta compared to previous
studies. We propose that GRB 980425 is associated with SN 1998bw and may have
resulted from an approximately spherical explosion producing ~10^-6 M_sun of
mildly relativistic ejecta with mean Lorentz factor ~2, which then interacted
with a dense circumstellar wind with mass loss rate ~few x 10^-4 M_sun/yr. A
highly asymmetric explosion is not required. An extreme model of ``hypernova''
explosions in massive stars is able to account for the energetics and
relativistic ejecta velocities required by many of the observed cosmological
GRBs. We present simplified models of explosions resulting from
accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs and phase transitions of neutron
stars. While we find increased energies in relativistic ejecta compared to
previous studies, these explosions are unlikely to be observed at cosmological
distances with current detectors. (abridged)

the bulk Lorentz factor and $\theta_{0}$ is the initial half opening angle of
the ejecta, and such a break is claimed to be present in the light curves of

afterglow light curves can be explained by jet effects. Here we present a
detailed calculation of the jet evolution and emission, and have obtained a
simple formula of bulk Lorentz factor evolution. We show that the light curves
are very smoothly steepened by jet effect, and the shape of the light curve is
determined by only one parameter -- $(E/n)^{1/8} \theta_{0}^{3/4}$, where E and
n are the fireball energy and surrounding medium density. We find that for

scale. The result of the comparison of our spectroscopic distances with the
trigonometric distances is that the spectroscopic distances are 55% larger.
Since using trigonometric parallaxes with large relative measurement errors can
introduce systematic errors, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation of the
biases introduced by selection effects and measurement errors. It turns out
that a difference between both distance scales of the observed size is expected
for the present day data if the underlying distance scales are identical. Thus
our finding is essentially a confirmation of the spectroscopic distance scale!
Good agreement is found between the spectroscopic distances and distances
derived from the interstellar NaD lines.
  All three independent methods of distance measurement indicate that the
widely used ""statistical"" distance scales of the Shklovsky type are too short
for old PNe. A correlation with nebular radii exists. The most likely
explanation is an underestimate of the nebula masses for large PN. Implications
for the nebula masses are discussed. Estimates of the PNe space density and
birthrate, which are based on Shklovsky type distances, therefore give too
large values.

hypothesized to be possible sources of metals in the intergalactic medium,

We model these winds as functions of mass of the parent galaxy and redshift,
assuming they activate at a common initial redshift, $z_{in}$, and calculate
the mean $y$ distortion and the angular power spectrum of the distortion in the
CMB. We find that the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect due to the winds

(kSZ) effect is, however, found to be more important than the thermal SZ (tSZ)
effect. We find that the distortion due to galactic winds is an important
contribution to the power spectrum of distortion at very small angular scales
$(l \sim 10^4)$. We also find that the power spectrum due to clustering
dominates the Poisson power spectrum for $l \le 4\hbox{--}5 \times 10^5$. We
show explicitly how the combined power spectrum from wind dominates over that

Friedmann Universe with zero $\Lambda$-term is presented. We argue that the
introduction of cosmic gravity waves helps to satisfy observational
constraints. The analysis of models is based on the confrontation with the mass
function of clusters of galaxies and the CMB anisotropy. The implication of
Press-Schechter formalism allowed to constrain $\sigma_8=0.52 \pm 0.01$. This
normalisation of the spectrum of density perturbations has been used to
calculate numerically the value of the large scale CMB anisotropy and the
relative contribution of cosmological gravitational waves, T/S. We found that
increasing $\Omega_\nu$ weakens the requirements to the value of T/S, however
even for $\Omega_\nu\le 0.4$ the models with $h+n\ge 1.5$ suggest considerable
abundance of gravitational waves, T/S${}^>_\sim 0.3$. Minimisation of the value
T/S is possible only in the range of the red spectra ($n<1$) and small $h$
($<0.6$). However the parameter $\Omega_\nu$ is strongly constrained by $\Delta
T/T$ data on the first acoustic peak of Sakharov oscillations. Assuming that
T/S $\in[0,3]$ and taking into account observational data on the amplitude of
the first acoustic peak we constrain the model parameters. We show that the
considered models admit both moderate red and blue spectra of density
perturbations $n\in [0.9,1.2]$ with rather high abundance hot dark matter,
$\Omega_\nu \in [0.2,0.4]$. Any condition, $n<0.9$ or $\Omega_\nu<0.2$,
decreases the relative amplitude of the first acoustic peak for more than 30%

networks, which growth is determined by a mechanism of preferential linking,
are used. We consider different forms of this preference and demonstrate that
the range of types of preference linking producing scale-free networks is wide.
We obtain also scaling relations for networks with nonlinear, accelerating
growth and describe temporal evolution of arising distributions. Size-effects -
cut-offs of these distributions - implement restrictions for observation of
power-law dependences. The main characteristic of interest is so-called degree
distribution, i.e., distribution of a number of connections of nodes. A scaling
form of the distribution of links between pairs of individual nodes for the
growing network of citations is also studied. We describe effects that produce
difference of nodes. ``Aging'' of nodes changes exponents of distributions.
Appearence of a single ``strong'' node changes dramatically the degree
distribution of a network. If its strength exceeds some threshold value, the
strong node captures a finite part of all links of a network. We show that
permanent random damage of a growing scale-free network - permanent deleting of
some links - change radically values of the scaling exponents. We describe the

similar to Pd-Er alloys, which explains their nonmonotonic relaxation after the
hydrogen saturation. It is based on the assumption that such a solid solution
involves two kind heterogeneities. The former are caused by spinodal
decomposition of the initially homogeneous state of the solid solution into the
phases enriched and depleted of Er atoms. The latter are crystalline defects
that trap an additional amount of Er atoms, which leads also to their local
accumulation, changing the defect properties. Hydrogen atoms penetrating into
the solid disturb the equilibrium of both the phase separation and the defect
saturation with Er atoms, causing redistribution of Er atoms. The diffusion
fluxes give rise to the motion of the interface between the two phases that is
responsible for time variations, for example, in the relative volume of the
enriched phase observed experimentally. We have found the conditions when the
interface motion can change the direction during the system relaxation to a new
equilibrium state. The latter effect is, from our point of view, the essence of
the hydrogen induced nonmonotonic relaxation observed in such systems. The
numerical simulation confirms the basic assumptions.

  Moreover, we point out the relevance in real geometry of the notion of the
orbifold fundamental group of a real variety, and we discuss related questions
on real varieties $(X, \sigma)$ whose underlying complex manifold $X$ is a $K
(\pi, 1)$.
  Our first result is that if $(S, \sigma)$ is a real hyperelliptic surface,
then the differentiable type of the pair $(S, \sigma)$ is completely determined
by the orbifold fundamental group exact sequence. This result allows us to
determine all the possible topological types of $(S, \sigma)$, and to prove
that they are exactly 78.
  It follows also as a corollary that there are exactly eleven cases for the
topological type of the real part of S.
  Finally, we show that once we fix the topological type of $(S, \sigma)$
corresponding to a real hyperelliptic surface, the corresponding moduli space
is irreducible (and connected).
  We also give, through a series of tables, explicit analytic representations
of the 78 components of the moduli space.

N/N-1. If N>2 there is no one - to -one correspondence between teleportation
and dense coding schemes in comparison with the EPR channel is exploited. A set
of schemes, for which two additional operations as entanglement and
disentanglement are permitted, is considered.

recently as plausible models for state reduction in quantum mechanics. Here we
formulate a general approach to stochastic Schrodinger dynamics in the case of
a nonlinear state space of the type proposed by Kibble. We derive a number of
new identities for observables in the nonlinear theory, and establish general
criteria on the curvature of the state space sufficient to ensure collapse of
the wave function.

nonlinear regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics in the optical domain,
however its accuracy is mitigated by two factors: higher-order photon
correlations, which contribute to an enhanced pair count rate, and
non-simultaneity of emitted photon pairs from the optical cavity. We show that
the technique of photon coincidence spectroscopy is effective in the presence
of these effects if the quantitative predictions are adjusted to include
non-simultaneity and higher-order correlations.

scalar attractive $\rho^{-2}$ potentials is investigated in detail. Other
attractive potentials are briefly considered.

maximal fidelity and prove that it is directly related to the largest zeroes of

approaches unity quadratically in 1/N. We also discuss this result in terms of
the dimension of the encoding Hilbert space.
