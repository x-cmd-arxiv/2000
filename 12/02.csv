to trace and quantify this evolution are still in their infancy. In this paper
I demonstrate that with the careful use of a `physical morphology' it is
possible to determine quantitatively how the process of galaxy evolution is
occurring out to z=4. Using a system of parameters that traces star formation
and galaxy interactions, I show how distinct galaxy populations at high-z can
be identified in deep high-resolution optical and NIR images. These tools are
also used to measure a potential merger fraction of galaxies from 0<z<4. If
these methods are reliable, as is suggested by a local galaxy calibration, the
merger fraction of galaxies scales as (1+z)^{2.1+/-0.5}, peaks near z=2, and
declines thereafter. I also discuss how this system is likely part of the
ultimate physical classification of galaxies.

Space Telescope between April and June 1999, over an interval of 69 days.
Images were obtained on 12 epochs in the F555W band and on five epochs in the
F814W band. The galaxy hosted the type Ia supernova SN1991T, which showed
relatively unusual behavior by having both an abnormal spectrum near light
maximum, and a slower declining light curve than the proto-typical Branch
normal SNe Ia.
  A total of 86 variables that are putative Cepheids have been found, with
periods ranging from 7.4 days to over 70 days. From photometry with the DoPHOT
program, the de-reddened distance modulus is determined to be (m-M)_0 = 30.67
+/- 0.12 (internal uncertainty) using a subset of the Cepheid data whose
reddening and error parameters are secure. A parallel analysis of the Cepheids
using photometry with ROMAFOT yields (m -M)_0 =30.82 +/- 0.11. The final
adopted modulus is (m -M)_0 =30.74 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.12 (d=14.1 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.8
Mpc).
  The photometric data for SN1991T are used in combination with the Cepheid
distance to NGC 4527 to obtain the absolute magnitude for this supernova of
M_V^0(max) = -19.85 +/- 0.29. The relatively large uncertainty is a result of
the range in estimates of the reddening to the supernova. Thus SN1991T is seen
to be only moderately brighter (by ~ 0.3 mag) than the mean for
spectroscopically normal supernovae, although magnitude differences of up to
0.6 mag cannot be ruled out.

theory, we can predict reliable peculiar velocities even for very nearby
galaxies (ie $cz \leq 500$\km). These predicted peculiar velocities are then
compared with the observed velocities of 12 galaxies with Cepheid distances.
The combination of the PSC-z galaxy survey (with its large sky coverage and
uniform selection), with the accurate Cepheid distances, makes this comparison
relatively free from systematic effects. We find that galaxies are good tracers
of the mass, even at small ($\leq 10$\mpc) scales; and under the assumption of
no biasing, $0.25 \leq \beta \leq 0.75$ (at 90% confidence). We use the

solutions in collisionless plasmas. In the wave frame of reference, a cold
plasma is flowing from one end and impacting on a low velocity plasma. First we
show that under astrophysical conditions, a cold electron-positron plasma is
unstable with respect to a two-stream instability in the interface between
these regions. The instability heats the inflowing cold plasma rapidly, on a
timescale comparable to the inverse of its plasma frequency. We then derive
time-independent equations to describe the resulting hot state of the pair
plasma, and describe the conditions under which the spatially uniform solution
is the unique stable solution for the post shock conditions. We also examine
plasmas composed of cold protons and hot electrons, and show that the spatially
uniform solution is the unique stable solution there as well. We state the
shock jump conditions which connect a cold, electron-proton plasma to a hot
electron-proton plasma. The generic feature evident in all of these models is
that the plasma's initial, directed kinetic energy gets almost completely
converted into heat. The magnetic field plays the role of catalyst which can
induce the plasma instability, but our solutions indicate that the macroscopic
field only gets amplified by a factor of approximately three in the frame of
the shock.

establishing a link between the observable characteristics of the zodiacal
cloud and the dynamical and physical properties of the parent minor bodies. Our
computational approach permits with modest computer resources to integrate the
trajectories of hundreds of particles and to effectively store up to
$10^{10-11}$ positions, which provides a high fidelity 3D distribution of the
dust. Our numerical codes account for the major dynamical effects that govern
the motion of IPD particles. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our codes by
performing the following analyses: (i) simulation of the distribution of
Centaurs (comets scattered in their journey from the Kuiper belt inward the
Solar system) and revealing the effects of the outer planets in producing
`cometary belts'; (ii) detailed inspection of a rich resonant structure found
in these belts, which predicts the existence of gaps similar to the Kirkwood
gaps in the main asteroid belt; (iii) a preliminary 3-D physical model of the
IPD cloud, which includes three dust components -- asteroidal, cometary, and
kuiperoidal -- and is consistent with the available data of Pioneers and
Voyagers dust detectors; (iv) modeling of the IPD cloud, which provides a
zodiacal light distribution in accord, to the order of 1%, with a subset of the
COBE/DIRBE observations; and (v) showing that the resonant structure in dusty
circumstellar disks of Vega and Epsilon Eridani is a signature of embedded
extrasolar planets. Further improvements of our modelling and their importance

thermal X-ray emission, which we attribute to their starburst components.
Comparing their X-ray and far-infrared properties with ordinary Seyfert and
starburst galaxies, we identify the spectral characteristics of their various
intrinsic emission sources. The observed far-infrared emission of the composite
galaxies may be associated almost exclusively with star formation, rather than
the active nucleus. The ratio of the hard X-ray luminosity to the far-infrared
and [O III] 5007 luminosity distinguishes most of these composite galaxies from
``pure'' Seyfert 2 galaxies, while their total observed hard X-ray luminosity
distinguishes them from ``pure'' starbursts. The hard nuclear X-ray source is
generally heavily absorbed (N_H > 10^{23} cm^{-2}) in the composite galaxies.
Based on these results, we suggest that the interstellar medium of the nuclear
starburst is a significant source of absorption. The majority of the sample are
located in groups or are interacting with other galaxies, which may trigger the
starburst or allow rapid mass infall to the central black hole, or both. We
conclude that starbursts are energetically important in a significant fraction
of active galaxies, and starbursts and active galactic nuclei may be part of a
common evolutionary sequence.

method to express multipole expansion by a distribution of pseudoparticles. We
can use this distribution of particles to calculate high order terms in both
the Barnes-Hut treecode and FMM. The primary advantage of P2M2 is that it works
on GRAPE. GRAPE is a special-purpose hardware for the calculation of
gravitational force between particles. Although the treecode has been
implemented on GRAPE, we could handle terms only up to dipole, since GRAPE can
calculate forces from point-mass particles only. Thus the calculation cost
grows quickly when high accuracy is required. With P2M2, the multipole
expansion is expressed by particles, and thus GRAPE can calculate high order
terms. Using P2M2, we implemented an arbitrary-order treecode on GRAPE-4.
Timing result shows GRAPE-4 accelerates the calculation by a factor between 10
(for low accuracy) to 150 (for high accuracy). Even on general-purpose
programmable computers, our method offers the advantage that the mathematical
formulae and therefore the actual program is much simpler than that of the
direct implementation of multipole expansion.

by three types of elementary excitations: spin waves, orbital waves, and
spin-and-orbital waves. The SE interactions between Cu^{2+} (d^9) ions are
inherently frustrated, which leads to a new mechanism of spin liquid which
operates in three dimensions. The SE between Mn^{3+} (d^4) ions explains the
A-type antiferromagnetic order in LaMnO_3 which coexists with the orbital
order. In contrast, the ferromagnetic metallic phase and isotropic spin waves
observed in doped manganites are explained by DE for degenerate e_g orbitals.
It is shown that although a hole does not couple to spin excitations in
ferromagnetic planes of LaMnO_3, the orbital excitations change the energy
scale for the coherent hole propagation and cause a large redistribution of
spectral weight. Finally, we point out some open problems in the present

of quantum field theory in flat spacetime are reliable and show that a rotating
black hole immersed in a magnetic field approaching the quantum critical value
of $B_k=m^2 c^3/(e\hbar) \approx 4.4 \times 10^{13}$~G $\approx
1.3\times10^{-11}$ cm$^{-1}$ is unstable. Specifically, a maximally rotating
three-solar-mass black hole immersed in a magnetic field of $2.3 \times
10^{12}$~G would be a copious producer of electron-positron pairs with a
luminosity of $3 \times 10^{52}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

potential of these conventional neutrino ``superbeams'' for observing

eigenstates, and measuring CP-violation in the lepton sector. The physics
capabilities of superbeams are explored as a function of the beam energy,
baseline, and the detector parameters. The trade-offs between very large
detectors with poor background rejection and smaller detectors with excellent
background rejection are illustrated. We find that it may be possible to
observe \nu_\mu\to\nu_e oscillations with a superbeam provided that the
amplitude parameter \sin^2 2\theta_{13} is larger than a few \times 10^{-3}. If
\sin^2 2\theta_{13} is of order 10^{-2} or larger, then the neutrino mass
hierarchy can be determined in long-baseline experiments, and if in addition
the large mixing angle MSW solution describes the solar neutrino deficit then
there is a small region of parameter space within which maximal CP-violation in
the lepton sector would be observable in a low-energy medium-baseline
experiment. We explicitly consider massive water Cherenkov and liquid argon
detectors at superbeams with neutrino energies ranging from 1 GeV to 15 GeV,
and baselines from 295 km to 9300 km. Finally, we compare the oscillation
physics prospects at superbeams with the corresponding prospects at neutrino
factories. The sensitivity at a neutrino factory to CP violation and the
neutrino mass hierarchy extends to values of the amplitude parameter \sin^2
2\theta_{13} that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than at a superbeam.

defines the width of momentum space form factors that appear in the
renormalized Hamiltonian vertices. Third-order corrections to the three-gluon
vertex exhibit asymptotic freedom, but the rate of change of the vertex with
lambda depends in a finite way on regularization of small-x singularities. This
dependence is shown in some examples, and a class of regularizations with two
distinct scales in x is found to lead to the Hamiltonian running coupling
constant whose dependence on lambda matches the known perturbative result from
Lagrangian calculus for the dependence of gluon three-point Green's function on
the running momentum scale at large scales. In the Fock space basis of
effective gluons with small lambda, the vertex form factors suppress
interactions with large kinetic energy changes and thus remove direct couplings
of low energy constituents to high energy components in the effective bound

"nlin/0012002","Mark B. Wise","Mark B. Wise, Vineer Bhansali","Universal Asymptotic Behavior of Mortgage Prepayments","6 pages, 1 figure",,,"CALT-68-2307","nlin.AO",,"  Mortgage prepayments play a crucial role in the pricing and hedging of
mortgage backed securities. An important feature of mortgage prepayment
modeling is burnout; as time goes on those borrowers who have the greatest
tendency to refinance are removed from the pool leaving only those that are
less likely to refinance. In this paper we examine the implications of burnout
on the late time prepayment rate using rather general assumptions. Analytic
formulas are derived for the average prepayment rate in the N'th month, P_N,
and the fraction of borrowers left in the pool in the N'th month, y_N. In the
case where the incentive to refinance, and other relevent economic factors, are
constant these results are particularly simple. For example, P_N=p+(1-p)/N+...
, where p is a constant and the ellipses denote terms suppressed by more powers
of 1/N or exponentially suppressed. The term of order 1/N indicates that
burnout causes the probability of prepayment to decrease as a very simple
function of N.

offer the most accurate datum in the region of low-energy Sigma-hyperon

Lambda-nucleon. In high angular momentum states this conversion is dominated by
the one-pion exchange. A joint analysis of the data of the scattering of
negative-Sigma on proton converting into a Lambda and a neutron and of the
atomic widths allows to extract a pseudovector pion-hyperon-Sigma coupling
constant of 0.048 with a statistical error of +-0.005 and a systematic one of
+-0.004. This corresponds to a pseudoscalar coupling constant of 13.3 with a
statistical uncertainty of 1.4 and a systematic one of 1.1.

profiles in families of homologous sequences for nine proteins whose folding
nucleus was determined by protein engineering methods. We show that in all but
one protein (AcP) folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved
than the rest of the protein. Two aspects of our study are especially
important: 1) grouping of amino acids into classes according to their
physical-chemical properties and 2) proper normalization of amino acid
probabilities that reflects the fact that evolutionary pressure to conserve
some amino acid types may itself affect concentration of various amino acid
types in protein families. Neglect of any of those two factors may make
physical and biological ``signals'' from conservation profiles disappear.

Bell-inequality violations that they take to be their primary concern. With
regard to the quantum-classical boundary, we demonstrate that fidelity
F{classical} = 1/2 remains the appropriate point of demarcation. The claims of
Grangier and Grosshans to the contrary are simply wrong, as we show by an
analysis of the conditions for nonseparability (that complements our earlier
treatment) and by explicit examples of Bell-inequality violations.

Two kinds of the helical waves deflect in the inhomogeneous fluid vorticity
field in the same way as spin particles in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

by classical correlations of separated random variables. It has been
interpreted as incompatibility of the requirement of locality with quantum
mechanics. We point out that in fact the space part of the wave function was
neglected in the proof of Bell's theorem. However this space part is crucial
for considerations of property of locality of quantum system. Actually the
space part leads to an extra factor in quantum correlations and as a result the
ordinary proof of Bell's theorem fails in this case. We present a criterium of
locality in a realist theory of hidden variables. It is argued that predictions
of quantum mechanics for Gaussian wave functions can be consistent with Bell's
inequalities and hence Einstein's local realism is restored in this case.
