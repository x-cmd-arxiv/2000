the ejecta of neutron star mergers (NSMs). The late stages of the inspiral and
the final violent coalescence of a neutron star binary have been calculated in
detail using a 3D hydrodynamics code (Newtonian gravity plus backreaction
forces emerging from the emission of gravitational waves) and a realistic
nuclear equation of state. The found trajectories for the ejecta serve as input
for dynamical r-process calculations where all relevant nuclear reactions
(including beta-decays depositing nuclear energy in the expanding material) are
followed. We find that all the ejected material undergoes r-process. For an
initial Ye close to 0.1 the abundance distributions reproduce very accurately
the solar r-process pattern for nuclei with A above 130. For lighter nuclei
strongly underabundant (as compared to solar) distributions are encountered. We
show that this behaviour is consistent with the latest observations of very
old, metal-poor stars, despite simplistic arguments that have recently been
raised against the possibility of NSM as possible sources of Galactic r-process
material.

{\it a neutrino burst} (and likely a burst of gamma-rays) may prove useful to
discriminate among all the existing theories of gravity. It is also stressed
that microlensing of gravitational waves emitted by known galactic sources

  Quebec 2000 Meeting Proceedings",,"10.1063/1.1351830",,"astro-ph",,"  Mean field dynamo theory is a leading candidate to explain the observed large
scale magnetic fields of galaxies and stars. However, controversy arises over
the extent of premature quenching by the backreaction of the growing field. We
distinguish between rapid mean field dynamo action, which is required by
astrophysical systems, and resistively limited action. We show how the flow of
magnetic helicity is important for rapid action. Existing numerical and
analytic work suggesting that mean field dynamos are prematurely quenched and
resistively limited include approximations or boundary conditions which
suppress the magnetic helicity flow from the outset. Thus they do not
unambiguously reveal whether real astrophysical mean field dynamos are
dynamically suppressed when the helicity flow is allowed. An outflow of
helicity also implies an outflow of magnetic energy and so active coronae or
winds should accompany mean field dynamos. Open boundaries alone may not be
sufficient for rapid dynamo action and the additional physics of buoyancy and
outflows may be required. Possible simulation approaches to test some of the
principles are briefly discussed. Some limitations of the ``Zeldovich
relation'' are also addressed.

shown that as a direct result of the classical Jeans instability and a secular
dissipative-type instability of small-amplitude gravity disturbances (e.g.
those produced by a spontaneous perturbation and/or a companion system) the
disk is subdivided into numerous irregular ringlets, with size and spacing of
