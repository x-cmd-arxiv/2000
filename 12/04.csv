uncertainty associated with the estimate. Specifically, we investigate (i) the
dynamical evolution of NS-NS binaries in the Galactic potential and the
vertical scale height of the population, (ii) the pulsar lifetimes, (iii) the
effects of the faint end of the radio pulsar luminosity function and their
dependence on the small number of observed objects, (iv) the beaming fraction,
and (v) the extrapolation of the Galactic rate to extragalactic distances
expected to be reachable by LIGO. We find that the dominant source of
uncertainty is the correction factor (up to about 200) for faint (undetectable)
pulsars. All other sources are much less important, each with uncertainty
factors smaller than 2. Despite the relatively large uncertainty, the derived
coalescence rate is approximately consistent with previously derived upper
limits, and is more accurate than rates obtained from population studies. We
obtain a most conservative lower limit for the LIGO II detection rate of 2
events per year. Our upper limit on the detection rate lies between 300 to more
than 1000 events per year.

optical and radio-optical spectral index images of the jet at $0.15''$

measurements, and $<\alpha_o > \approx 0.9$ ($F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$),
slightly flatter than previous workers. Reasons for this discrepancy are
discussed. These observations reveal a large variety of spectral slopes. Bright
knots exhibit flatter spectra than interknot regions. The flattest spectra
($\alpha_o \sim 0.5-0.6$; comparable to or flatter than $\alpha_{ro}$) are
found in two inner jet knots (D-East and HST-1) which contain the fastest
superluminal components. In knots A, B and C, $\alpha_o$ and $\alpha_{ro}$ are
essentially anti-correlated. Near the flux maxima of knots HST-1 and F, changes
in $\alpha_{ro}$ lag changes in $\alpha_o$, but in knots D and E, the opposite
relationship is observed. This is further evidence that radio and optical
emissions in the M87 jet come from substantially different physical regions.
The delays observed in the inner jet are consistent with localized particle
acceleration, with $t_{acc} << t_{cool}$ for optically emitting electrons in
knots HST-1 and F, and $t_{acc} \sim t_{cool}$ for optically emitting electrons
in knots D and E. Synchrotron models yield $\nu_B \gsim 10^{16}$ Hz for knots
D, A and B, and somewhat lower values, $\nu_B \sim 10^{15}- 10^{16}$ Hz, in
other regions. If X-ray emissions from knots A, B and D are co-spatial with
optical and radio emission, we can strongly rule out the ``continuous
injection'' model. Because of the short lifetimes of X-ray synchrotron emitting
particles, the X-ray emission likely fills volumes much smaller than the
optical emission regions.

magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star. The charge depletion due to a global
current causes a large electric field along the magnetic field lines. Migratory
electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field to radiate curvature
gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to materialize as pairs in
the gap. As a result of this pair-production cascade, the replenished charges
partially screen the electric field, which is self-consistently solved together
with the distribution of particles and gamma-rays. If no current is injected at
neither of the boundaries of the accelerator, the gap is located around the
so-called null surface, where the local Goldreich-Julian charge density
vanishes. However, we find that the gap position shifts outwards (or inwards)
when particles are injected at the inner (or outer) boundary. We apply the
theory to the nine pulsars of which X-ray fields are known from observations.
We show that the gap should be located near to or outside of the null surface
for the Vela pulsar and PSR B1951+32, so that their expected GeV spectrum may
be consistent with observations. We then demonstrate that the intrinsically
large TeV flux from the outer gap of PSR B0540-69 is absorbed by the
magnetospheric infrared photons to be undetectable. We also point out that the
electrodynamic structure and the resultant GeV emission properties of
millisecond pulsars are similar to young pulsars.

this paper I address some of the aspects of our current understanding of BH

theoretical models. In particular, the measured orbital periods and donor-star
properties indicate that a common-envelope phase appears to be a necessary
ingredient of the evolutionary history of observed BH X-ray transients, and
that it must be associated only with a modest orbital contraction. The timing
of this common-envelope phase is crucial in determining the final BH masses and
current evolutionary models of mass-losing massive stars place strong
constraints on the possible masses for immediate BH progenitors and wind mass
loss from helium stars. Last, it is interesting that, even in the absence of
any source of mass loss, the highest helium-star masses predicted by current
evolutionary models are still not high enough to account for the measured BH
mass in V404 Cyg (>10 solar masses). An alternative for the formation of
relatively massive BH may be provided by the evolutionary sequence proposed by
Eggleton & Verbunt (1986), which invokes hierarchical triples as progenitors of

demonstrate that compressing a galaxy's light distribution along the line of

profiles as radial anisotropy. In particular, fitting spherically symmetric
dynamical models to apparently round, isotropic face-on flattened galaxies
leads to a spurious bias towards radial orbits in the models, especially if the
galaxy has a weak face-on stellar disk. Such face-on stellar disks could
plausibly be the cause of the radial anisotropy found in spherical models of
intermediate luminosity ellipticals such as NGC 2434, NGC 3379 and NGC 6703.

follow a Tully-Fisher relation parallel to that for spiral galaxies, but
fainter by at least 0.8 mag (I-band) for a given mass. The most luminous

of sustaining a large-scale dynamo by the negative magnetic eddy diffusivity
effect are quite common. This conclusion is based on numerical examination of a
large number of randomly selected flows. Few outliers with strongly negative
eddy diffusivities are also found, and they are interpreted in terms of the
closeness of the control parameter to a critical value for generation of a
small-scale magnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that, for parity-invariant
flows, a moderate separation of scales between the basic flow and the magnetic
field often significantly reduces the critical magnetic Reynolds number for the
onset of dynamo action.

the scenario of {\it weak collapse}: The inner core of the condensate diverges
with an almost zero particle number, while its tail distribution spreads out to
large distances with a constant density profile. For this case, the 3-body
recombination arrests the collapse, but it weakly dissipates the atoms. The
confining trap then reforms the condensate at later times. In contrast, 2D
condensates undergo a {\it strong collapse}: The atoms stay mainly located at
center and recombination sequentially absorbs a significant amount of
particles.

obeys a master equation. The master equation evolution can be unraveled into
stochastic nonlinear trajectories for a pure state $P$, such that on average
$P$ reproduces $\rho$. Here we give for the first time a complete
parameterization of all diffusive unravelings (in which $P$ evolves
continuously but non-differentiably in time). We give an explicit measurement
theory interpretation for these quantum trajectories, in terms of monitoring
the system's environment. We also introduce new classes of diffusive
unravelings that are invariant under the linear operator transformations under
which the master equation is invariant. We illustrate these invariant
unravelings by numerical simulations. Finally, we discuss generalized gauge
transformations as a method of connecting apparently disparate descriptions of
the same trajectories by stochastic Schr\""odinger equations, and their
invariance properties.
