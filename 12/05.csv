theory and the existence of the faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local
Group. Theoretical considerations suggest that a cold dark matter universe has
been a very hostile place for the formation of small galaxies. In particular,
gas would not have been able to cool and condense to form stars inside dark
matter halos with a velocity dispersion <10km/s since before the cosmological
reionization epoch. In other words, one should not expect to see any major star
formation activities in dwarf galaxies with a velocity dispersion <10km/s
during the past 12Gyr, according to the current structure formation theory. The
real universe, on the other hand, shows that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies in
the Local Group have velocity dispersions <10km/s and extended and recent star
formation activities are quite common in them. This apparent conflict between
cold dark matter models and local observations can be resolved, if one allows
the cold dark matter particles to decay relatively recently. The resolution
comes about in that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies with a velocity dispersion of
\~10km/s seen today were born, in this picture, in a small fraction of halos
with a velocity dispersion of ~20km/s, where gas can be retained and is able to
cool and contract to form stars. The presently observed lower velocity
dispersion ~10km/s of these dwarf spheroidal galaxies is a consequence of the
decay of one half of the dark matter in and subsequent expansion of the halos
since redshift z~2.

massive clusters similar to the well studied cluster MS1054-03. Assuming the
clusters have the same gas mass fraction as that derived from SZE measurements
of eighteen known massive clusters, we are able to infer their mass and
electron temperature from the SZE data. The derived electron temperatures are
9.8, 8.7, and 10.4 keV, respectively, and we infer total masses of ~2 x 10^14

temperatures are available for Cl1226+33, and thus the SZE data provide the
first confirmation that it is indeed a massive system. The demonstrated ability

dimensional the flows are generally chaotic in the cocoon, and the jet itself
can flail about violently. The bending jet can pinch itself off and redirect
itself to enhance its penetration of the ambient medium. These behaviors often
eliminate the presence of a strong jet termination shock, which is assumed
present in all modern cartoon models of the RG phenomenon. Instead a much more
complex ``shock web'' forms near the end of the jet that leads to a far less
predictable pattern of particle acceleration. Similarly, the magnetic fields in
these flows are highly filamented, as well as spatially and temporally
intermittent. This leads to a very localized and complex pattern of synchrotron
aging for relativistic electron populations, which makes it difficult to use

High surface brightness, red, highly concentrated galaxies are on average more

which the SDSS measures galaxy fluxes, we obtain luminosity densities 2.0 times

from the burst itself by a shell of dust at a radius R from the progenitor, and
(2) the absorption and thermal re-emission of this light by this shell of dust.

and find we can consistently fit all of the CO data with an inverse temperature
gradient that is warmer at the edge than the centre. However, when we combine
the CO data with the previously published millimetre data we fail to find a
simultaneous fit to both data-sets without additionally allowing the CO
abundance to decrease towards the centre. This effect has been observed
qualitatively many times before, as the CO freezes out onto the dust grains at
high densities, but we quantify the effect. Hence we show that the combination

ground-based 4.8 micron and ISO 9.6 micron luminosities are well correlated
with the hard X-ray luminosities of Sy 1s and 2s. These continuum emissions
appear as a good indicator of the AGN luminosity, at least in the cases of hard
X-ray Compton-thin Sy galaxies. We finally stress the finding that some Compton
thick galaxies show bright non-stellar emission at 5 micron. This suggests that
the near-IR emission in Sys is produced in an extended component illuminated by
the central source, that is more visible from all viewing angles. We discuss
possible implications of mid-IR surveys for the search of counterparts of
highly obscured hard X-ray sources. (Abridged)

investigate the destruction of protoplanetary disks by close stellar encounters
and UV radiation from massive stars. The simulations model a cluster of 4000
stars, and we consider separately cases in which the disks have fixed radii of
100 AU and 10 AU. In the former case, depending on a star's position and orbit
in the cluster over 10^7 years, UV photoevaporation removes at least 0.01 Msol
from its disk, and can remove up to 1 Msol. We find no dynamical models of the
ONC consistent with the suggestion of Storzer and Hollenbach that the observed
distribution and abundance of proplyds could be explained by a population of
stars on radial orbits which spend relatively little time near Theta 1C Ori
(the most massive star in the ONC). Instead the observations require either
massive disks (e.g. a typical initial disk mass of 0.4 Msol) or a very recent
birth for Theta 1C Ori. When we consider the photoevaporation of the inner 10
AU of disks in the ONC, we find that planet formation would be hardly affected.
Outside that region, planets would be prevented from forming in about half the
systems, unless either the initial disk masses were very high or they formed in
less than ~ 2 Myr and Theta 1C Ori has only very recently appeared. We also
present statistics on the distribution of minimum stellar encounter
separations. This peaks at 1000 AU, with less than 10% of stars having had an
encounter closer than 100 AU after 10^7 years. We conclude that stellar
encounters are unlikely to play a significant role in destroying protoplanetary
disks. In the absence of any disruption mechanism other than those considered
here, we would thus predict planetary systems like our own to be common amongst
stars forming in ONC-like environments.

galaxies with the nominal flux limit S=3.0 10^{-12}erg/s/cm2 for the ROSAT
energy band (0.1-2.4)keV. Several tests are performed showing no significant
incompletenesses of the REFLEX clusters with X-ray luminosities brighter than
10^{43}erg/s up to scales of about 800 Mpc/h. They also indicate that cosmic
variance might be more important than previous studies suggest. We regard this
as a warning not to draw general cosmological conclusions from cluster samples
with a size smaller than REFLEX. Power spectra, P(k), of comoving cluster
number densities are estimated for flux- and volume-limited subsamples. The
most important result is the detection of a broad maximum within the comoving
wavenumber range 0.022<k<0.030 h/Mpc. The data suggest an increase of the power
spectral amplitude with X-ray luminosity. Compared to optically selected
cluster samples the REFLEX P(k)is flatter for wavenumbers k<0.05 h/Mpc thus
shifting the maximum of P(k) to larger scales. The smooth maximum is not
consistent with the narrow peak detected at k=0.05 h/Mpc using the Abell/ACO
richness $\ge 0$ data. In the range 0.02<k<0.4 h/Mpc general agreement is found
between the slope of the REFLEX P(k) and those obtained with optically selected

0.9<p<1.5, and usually close to 1. But there are also more complex aftershock
sequences for which the Omori law can be considered only as a first
approximation. One of these complex aftershock sequences took place in the
Eastern Pyrenees on February 18, 1996, and was described in detail by {\it
Correig et al.} [1997]. In this paper, we propose a new model inspired by
dynamic fiber-bundle models to interpret this type of complex aftershock
sequences with sudden increases in the rate of aftershock production not
directly related to the magnitude of the aftershocks (as in the epidemic-type
aftershock sequences). The model is a simple, discrete, stochastic fracture
model where the elements (asperities or barriers) break because of static
fatigue, transfer stress according to a local load-sharing rule and then are
regenerated. We find a very good agreement between the model and the Eastern
Pyrenees aftershock sequence and we propose that the key mechanism for
explaining aftershocks, apart from a time-dependent rock strength, is the
presence of dynamic stress fluctuations which constantly reset the initial
conditions for the next aftershock in the sequence.

characters of the phenomenon are ordered domains, whose size increases while
approaching the threshold until they fuse into a spanning structure, so that

using survival probabilities resulted from Monte Carlo simulations.
Parametrizations of all continuous energy losses are obtained with using the
most recent expressions for muon interaction cross-sections. The corresponding
parametrization errors and field of method application are comprehensively
discussed. The proposed formulae could be useful primarily for experimentalists
processing data of arrays located deep under water or under ice.

weakly with ordinary particles. One or both of them may be light. We consider a
class of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model in which interactions
of sgoldstinos with quarks and gluons conserve parity but do not conserve quark
flavor. If the pseudoscalar sgoldstino $P$ is light, m_P<(m_K-2m_\pi), and the
scalar sgoldstino is heavier, m_S>(m_K-m_\pi), an interesting place for
experimental searches is the poorly explored area of three-body decays of
kaons, K^0_{S,L}\to\pi^+\pi^- P, K^0_{S,L}\to\pi^0\pi^0 P and K^+\to\pi^+\pi^0
P, with $P$ subsequently decaying into \gamma\gamma, possibly e^+e^-, or flying
away from the detector. We evaluate the constraints on the flavor-violating
coupling of sgoldstino to quarks which are imposed by K^0_L-K^0_S mass
difference and CP-violation in neutral kaon system, and find that these
constraints allow for fairly large Br(K\to\pi\pi P). We find that the most
interesting ranges of branching ratios start at Br(K^0_L\to\pi\pi P)\sim
10^{-3}, Br(K^+\to\pi^+\pi^0 P)\sim 10^{-4}, Br(K_S^0\to\pi\pi P)\sim 10^{-3}.
These searches for light pseudoscalar sgoldstino would be sensitive to the
supersymmetry breaking scale \sqrt{F} in the 100 TeV range and above. We also
briefly discuss the cases of light scalar sgoldstino and relatively heavy
sgoldstinos.

context of the quantum anomaly problem. Any classical supersymmetric system
characterized by the nonlinear in the Hamiltonian superalgebra is
symplectomorphic to a supersymmetric canonical system with the holomorphic form
of the supercharges. Depending on the behaviour of the superpotential, the
canonical supersymmetric systems are separated into the three classes. In one
of them the parameter specifying the supersymmetry order is subject to some
sort of classical quantization, whereas the supersymmetry of another extreme
class has a rather fictive nature since its fermion degrees of freedom are
decoupled completely by a canonical transformation. The nonlinear supersymmetry
with polynomial in momentum supercharges is analysed, and the most general
one-parametric Calogero-like solution with the second order supercharges is
found. Quantization of the systems of the canonical form reveals the two
anomaly-free classes, one of which gives rise naturally to the quasi-exactly
solvable systems. The quantum anomaly problem for the Calogero-like models is
``cured'' by the specific superpotential-dependent term of order $\hbar^2$. The
nonlinear supersymmetry admits the generalization to the case of
two-dimensional systems.

consider families of magnetic fields, dependent on two parameters, a typical
value $B_{m}$ for the field and a typical range d. We investigate the behavior
of the effective action for three distinct cases: 1) keeping $\Phi$ (or
$B_{m}d^{2}$) constant and varying d, 2) keeping $B_{m}$ constant and varying d
and 3) keeping d constant and varying $\Phi$ (or $B_{m}d^{2}$). We note an
interesting difference as d tends to infinity (case 2) between smooth and
discontinuous magnetic fields. In the strong field limit (case 3) we also
derive an explicit asymptotic formula for the 3+1 dimensional action. We study
the stability of the magnetic field and we show that magnetic fields of the

appropriate regions we check our numerical results against the Schwinger

generalize the values of the Riemann zeta function at odd positive integers and
are also called MZVs, multizetas, multiple harmonic series or Euler/Zagier

relations between them. The torsor structure underlying these relations should
in that case be se same as Drinfeld's torsor made of the Grothendieck-

Galois group on the projective line minus finitely many points. It is an easy
consequence of the torsor structure that the algebra defined by these relations
is a polynomial algebra. This was stated first by J. Ecalle in the polyzetas

of geomagnetic activity is accompanied by an increase in total intensity of
TEC; however, it correlates not with the absolute level of Dst, but with the
value of the time derivative of Dst (a maximum correlation coefficient reaches
-0.94). The delay of the TID response of the order of 2 hours is consistent
with the view that TIDs are generated in auroral regions, and propagate
equatorward with the velocity of about 300-400 m/s.

energy (i.e., the Lagrangian functional) taking the form ${\cal L}\sim\int
k^\alpha|{\bf v_k}|^2d^3{\bf k}$ in 3D Fourier representation, where $\alpha$
is a constant, $0<\alpha< 1$. Unlike the case $\alpha=0$ (the usual Eulerian
hydrodynamics), a finite value of $\alpha$ results in a finite energy for a
singular, frozen-in vortex filament. This property allows us to study the
dynamics of such filaments without the necessity of a regularization procedure
for short length scales. The linear analysis of small symmetrical deviations
from a stationary solution is performed for a pair of anti-parallel vortex
filaments and an analog of the Crow instability is found at small wave-numbers.
A local approximate Hamiltonian is obtained for the nonlinear long-scale
dynamics of this system. Self-similar solutions of the corresponding equations
are found analytically. They describe the formation of a finite time
singularity, with all length scales decreasing like $(t^*-t)^{1/(2-\alpha)}$,
where $t^*$ is the singularity time.

'flowing' from a Feynman Clock (FC), via a 'signal', to a Feynman Detector (FD)
in causal networks. Macroscopic arrows of time are built from the irreversible
Quantum Arrow of Time (QAT) associated with unstable or excited states of
quantum systems. The QAT is shown to be connected to the thermodynamic arrow of
time. Collective Excitations, and causal networks provide a means for
understanding 'time' in complex systems. The ordered set of the 'time' numbers
labeling 'events' can be used to construct the 'direction' and 'dimension'

quantum, classical and realtivistic mechanics.

quantum nature through the process known as decoherence. Here we present a
method for minimizing decoherence by making it energetically unfavorable. We
present a Hamiltonian made up solely of two-body interactions between four
two-level systems (qubits) which has a two-fold degenerate ground state. This
degenerate ground state has the property that any decoherence process acting on
an individual physical qubit must supply energy from the bath to the system.
Quantum information can be encoded into the degeneracy of the ground state and
such coherence-preserving qubits will then be robust to local decoherence at
low bath temperatures. We show how this quantum information can be universally
manipulated and indicate how this approach may be applied to a quantum dot
quantum computer.

the real experiments leads to loopholes. Ideal experiments involve either
inequalities (Bell) or equalities (Greenberger, Horne, Zeilinger). Every real
experiment has its own critical inequalities, which are almost all more
complicated than the corresponding ideal inequalities and equalities. If one of
these critical inequalities is violated, then the detection loophole is closed,
with no further assumptions. If all the critical inequalities are satisfied,
then it remains open, unless further assumptions are made. The computer program
described here and published on the website
http://www.strings.ph.qmw.ac.uk/QI/main.htm obtains the critical inequalities
for any real experiment, given the number of allowed settings of the angles and
the corresponding possible output signals for a single run. Given all the
necessary conditional probabilities or rates, it tests whether all these
inequalities are satisfied.
