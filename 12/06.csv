produces a non-Gaussian covariance in the shear power spectrum measurements
that affects their translation into cosmological parameters. Using the dark
matter halo approach, we study the covariance of binned band power spectrum
estimates and the four point function of the dark matter density field that
underlies it. We compare this semi-analytic estimate to results from N-body
numerical simulations and find good agreement. We find that for a survey out to
z ~ 1, the power spectrum covariance increases the errors on cosmological
parameters determined under the Gaussian assumption by about 15%.

background. While the entire infrared and submillimeter spectrum shape based on
models has been fixed and the density scaled as a whole in previous studies,
recent measures on the low and high energy infrared background are extensively
used in this paper. In this original approach, the infrared distribution is
only varied in the unexplored 3.5-100 microns region. With conservative
hypothesis on the intrinsic spectra of Mkn 501, an upper limit of 4.7
nW.m-2.sr-1 between 5 and 15 microns is derived, which is very close to the
lower limit inferred from deep ISOCAM cosmological surveys at 15 microns. This
result is shown to be independent of the exact density of the lambda < 3.5
microns and lambda > 100 microns infrared distribution within the uncertainties
of the measurements. Moreover, the study presented here rules out a complete
extragalactic origin for the 60 microns excess found by Finkbeiner et al.

torques which induce disk warping and precession. These torques arise from
interactions between the stellar field and the induced surface currents on the
disk. Applying these new effects to weakly magnetized ($B\sim 10^7-10^9$G)
neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamical
warping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of
relativistic frame dragging, classical precession due to the oblateness of the
neutron star, and the magnetic torques. Under quite general conditions, the
magnetic warping torque can overcome the ``Bardeen-Petterson'' viscous damping
and makes the modes grow. The modes are confined to the inner region of the
disk, and have frequencies close to the sum of the Lense-Thirring frequency,
the classical precession frequency, and the magnetically driven precession
frequency evaluated at the inner disk radius $r_{in}$. As $\dot M$ increases,
the mode frequency is reduced relative to the total precession frequency at
$r_{in}$ since the mode is less concentrated around $r_{in}$ due to the
increasing viscous stress associated with the large $\dot M$. Because of this,
and because the magnetically driven precession is retrograde and depends
strongly on $\dot M$, the mode frequency can have a non-monotonic dependence on
$\dot M$. This may account for several observed features of low-frequency
(10--60 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) in low-mass X-ray binaries
which are otherwise difficult to explain, such as the flattening/turnover in
the LFQPO frequency--$\dot M$ correlation or in the LFQPO frequency--kHz QPO

sequence we find objects whose jet power can rival the power extracted by
accretion, while at the low power end of the sequence we find TeV and TeV
candidate blazars, whose spectral properties can give information on the
particle acceleration mechanism and can help to measure the IR background. Most
of the emission of blazars is produced at a distance of few hundreds
Schwarzschild radii from the center, and must be a small fraction of the
kinetic power carried by the jet itself: most of the jet energy must be
transported outwards, to power the extended radio structures. The radiation
produced by jets can be the result of internal shocks between shells of plasma
with different bulk Lorentz factors. This mechanism, thought to be at the
origin of the gamma-rays observed in gamma-ray bursts, can work even better in
blazars, explaining the observed main characteristics of these objects. Chandra
very recently discovered large scale X-ray jets both in blazars and in
radio-galaxies, which can be explained by enhanced Compton emission with
respect to a pure synchrotron self Compton model. In fact, besides the local
synchrotron emission, the radiation coming from the sub-pc jet core and the
cosmic background radiation can provide seed photons for the scattering
process, enahancing the large scale jet X-ray emission in radio-galaxies and
blazars, respectively.

in weakly coupled layered superconductors. In the treatment of the amplitude
fluctuations we employ the Gaussian approximation and evaluate the longitudinal
relaxation rate 1/T1 for a clean s-wave superconductor, with and without pair
breaking effects, using the static pair fluctuation propagator D. The increase
in 1/T1 due to pair breaking in D is overcompensated by the decrease arising
from the single particle Green's functions. The result is a strong effect on
1/T1 for even a small amount of pair breaking. The phase fluctuations are
described in terms of dynamical BKT excitations in the form of pancake
vortex-antivortex (VA) pairs. We calculate the effect of the magnetic field
fluctuations caused by the translational motion of VA excitations on 1/T1 and
on the transverse relaxation rate 1/T2 on both sides of the BKT transitation

the two subsystems get decoupled but their renormalized kinetic energies become
mutually dependent on each other. Choosing for the inter - subsystem
interaction a charge exchange term (the Boson-Fermion model) the initially
localized Bosons acquire itinerancy through their dependence on the
renormalized Fermion dispersion. This latter evolves from a free particle
dispersion into one showing a pseudogap structure near the chemical potential.
Upon lowering the temperature both subsystems simultaneously enter a
macroscopic coherent quantum state. The Bosons become superfluid, exhibiting a
soundwave like dispersion while the Fermions develop a true gap in their
dispersion. The essential physical features described by this technique are
already contained in the renormalization of the kinetic terms in the respective
Hamiltonians of the two subsystems. The extra interaction terms resulting in
the process of iteration only strengthen this physics. We compare the results
with previous calculations based on selfconsistent perturbative approaches.

use of the full LEP1 data sample comprising 161 pb^-1 of integrated luminosity

contributions from pure Z exchange and from Z-gamma interference allows the
parameters of the Z resonance to be determined in a model-independent way. Our
results are in good agreement with lepton universality and consistent with the
vector and axial-vector couplings predicted in the Standard Model. A fit to the
complete dataset yields the fundamental Z resonance parameters: mZ = 91.1852 +-

measurement of the ratio between the decay width into invisible particles and
the width to a single species of charged lepton, Ginv/Gl = 5.942 +- 0.027.

Standard Model couplings for neutrinos, this translates into a measurement of
the effective number of light neutrino species, N_nu = 2.984 +- 0.013.

Universe. Substantial effect can be produced by scattering of the neutrinos
from cosmological sources ($z\gta 1$) on the relic neutrino background,
provided that the latter has large CP-asymmetry: $\eta\equiv
(n_\nu-n_{\bar{\nu}})/n_\gamma\gta 1$, where $n_\nu$, $n_{\bar{\nu}}$ and
$n_\gamma$ are the concentrations of neutrinos, antineutrinos and photons. We
consider in details the dynamics of conversion in the expanding neutrino
background. Applications are given to the diffuse fluxes of neutrinos from
GRBs, AGN, and the decay of super-heavy relics. We find that the vacuum
oscillation probability can be modified by $\sim (10-20)%$ and in extreme cases
allowed by present bounds on $\eta$ the effect can reach $\sim 100%$.
Signatures of matter effects would consist (i) for both active-active and
active-sterile conversion, in a deviation of the numbers of events produced in
a detector by neutrinos of different flavours,
$N_{\alpha}~(\alpha=e,\mu,\tau)$, and of their ratios from the values given by
vacuum oscillations; such deviations can reach $\sim 5-15%$, (ii) for
active-sterile conversion, in a characteristic energy dependence of the ratios

interactions (the so called Standard Model). The roots of gauge invariance go
back to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first
electrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the
discovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same
observable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought
forth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell;
4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the
modern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a
century later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical
electrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged
spinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The
latter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to
multiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the
accompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector
potential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general
principle and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in
English. The present era of non-abelian gauge theories started in 1954 with the
paper by C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills.

the new physics corrections to the branching ratios of those QCD

be measurable at the future hadron colliders with large $b$ production. (d)
Among the studied thirty nine $B_s$ meson decay modes, seven of them can have a

behaves effectively like an imperfect radiation fluid with anisotropic stress.
We define curvature perturbations on uniform density surfaces for both the
matter and Weyl fluids, and show that their evolution on large scales follows
directly from the energy conservation equations for each fluid. The total
curvature perturbation is not necessarily constant for adiabatic matter
perturbations, but can change due to the Weyl entropy perturbation. To relate
this curvature perturbation to the longitudinal gauge metric potentials
requires knowledge of the Weyl anisotropic stress which is not determined by
the equations on the brane. We discuss the implications for large-angle

that the collision-induced crosstalk is partly attenuated in comparison with

calculated in the Relativistic Fermi Gas model, both in the quasi-elastic and
in the $\Delta$ peak regions. The impact of relativistic kinematics at high
momentum transfer is investigated through an expansion in the initial nucleonic
momentum, which is however exact in the four-momentum of the exchanged boson.
The same expansion is applied to the meson exchange currents in the
particle-hole sector: it is shown that the non-relativistic currents can be
corrected by simple kinematical factors to account for relativity. The
left-right asymmetry measured via polarized electron scattering is finally
evaluated in the quasi-elastic and $\Delta$ peaks.

  Paradox","23 pages, 11 figures, 11 equations",,,,"physics.class-ph",,"  The inversion of cause and effect in the classic description of
electromagnetism, gives rise to a conceptual error which is at the bottom of
many paradoxes and exceptions. At present, the curious fact that unipolar
induction or the Faraday Disc constitutes an exception to the Faraday induction
law is generally accepted. When we establish the correct cause and effect
relationship a close connection appears between mechanics and electromagnetism,
as does a new induction law for which paradoxes or exceptions do not occur.
Some paradoxical experiments in unipolar induction involving the unique
geometry of the spiral are described demonstrating the inversion of cause and
effect. The emf and torque of the Faraday Disc and the conducting spiral is due
to the continuous variation of the electromagnetic angular moment of the
continuous current. This experiments confirm the Lorentz Force and invalidate
Faradays Induction Law. They show how in a closed circuit emf and unipolar
torque are not produced by the variation in magnetic flux, which is constant,
but by two variations in the electromagnetic angular moment. The three possible
ways of varying the electromagnetic angular moment generated by the circulation
of the charges gives rise to the different forms of electromagnetic induction.

studied. In some of the earlier work the effect of intercenter coupling on the
dissipative part was neglected. This is equivalent to a zeroth-order
perturbative expansion of the damping term with respect to the intercenter
coupling. It is shown numerically for two coupled harmonic oscillators that
this treatment can lead to artifacts and a completely wrong description, for
example, of a charge transfer processes even for very weak intercenter
coupling. Here we perform a first-order treatment and show that these artifacts
disappear. In addition, we demonstrate that the thermodynamic equilibrium
population is almost reached even for strong intercenter coupling strength.

essential for the future large scale realization of quantum communication
schemes such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Because of the
unavoidable noise in the quantum communication channel, the entanglement
between two particles is more and more degraded the further they propagate.
Entanglement purification is thus essential to distill highly entangled states
from less entangled ones. Existing general purification protocols are based on
the quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) or similar quantum logic operations, which
are very difficult to implement experimentally. Present realizations of CNOT
gates are much too imperfect to be useful for long-distance quantum
communication. Here we present a feasible scheme for the entanglement
purification of general mixed entangled states, which does not require any CNOT
operations, but only simple linear optical elements. Since the perfection of
such elements is very high, the local operations necessary for purification can
be performed with the required precision. Our procedure is within the reach of
current technology and should significantly simplify the implementation of
long-distance quantum communication.

waveguide-type nonlinear device and performed a two-photon interference
experiment with an unbalanced Michelson interferometer. Parametric
down-converted photons from the nonlinear device are detected by two detectors
located at the output ports of the interferometer. Because the interferometer
is constructed with two optical paths of different length, photons from the
shorter path arrive at the detector earlier than those from the longer path. We
find that the difference of arrival time and the time window of the coincidence
counter are important parameters which determine the boundary between the
classical and quantum regime. When the time window of the coincidence counter
is smaller than the arrival time difference, fringes of high visibility
(80$\pm$ 10%) were observed. This result is only explained by quantum theory
and is clear evidence for quantum entanglement of the interferometer's optical
paths.
