incomplete sky coverage and test it with simulated examples such as Boomerang
2001 and MAP. By augmenting the quadratic estimator method with an additional
step, we find that the E and B power spectra can be effectively disentangled on
angular scales substantially smaller than the width of the sky patch in the
narrowest direction. We find that the basic quadratic and maximum-likelihood
methods display a unneccesary sensitivity to systematic errors when T-E
cross-correlation is involved, and show how this problem can be eliminated at
negligible cost in increased error bars. We also test numerically the widely
used approximation that sample variance scales inversely with sky coverage, and
find it to be an excellent approximation on scales substantially smaller than
the sky patch.

low-luminosity AGN or do they exist in radio-quiet AGN? A recent detection of
superluminal motion in a supposedly radio-quiet Seyfert raises the question
whether beaming can play an important role in some of these objects as well.
Moreover, VLBI observations of nearby low-luminosity AGN reveal compact
flat-spectrum radio cores very similar to those in bright radio-loud blazars.
Furthermore, with the detection of X-ray emission from the least luminous AGN
we can study, Sgr A* in the Galactic Center, this source now seems to be
dominated entirely by non-thermal emission -- like in BL Lacs. The same may be
true for some X-ray binaries in the Low/Hard-state. Inclusion of low-power
radio jets into the overall picture of AGN provides some clues for what type of
accretion is important, what the power, radiative efficiency and matter-content
of jets is, and what mechanism could be responsible for making jets radio-loud.
We specifically discuss whether proton-proton collisions in a hot accretion
flow could provide the switch for the radio-dichotomy.

estimated on the basis of the assumption that the dynamics of the broad

commonly-employed method is to estimate a characteristic size-scale $r_*$ from

proto-neutron star, to its old age as a cold, catalyzed configuration, are
described. A proto-neutron star is formed in the aftermath of a successful
supernova explosion and its evolution is dominated by neutrino diffusion. Its
neutrino signal is a valuable diagnostic of its internal structure and
composition. During its transformation from a hot, lepton-rich to a cold,
catalyzed remnant, the possibility exists that it can collapse into a black
hole, which abruptly terminates neutrino emissions. The essential microphysics,
reviewed herein, that controls its evolution are the equation of state of dense
matter and its associated neutrino opacities. Several simulations of the
proto-neutron star evolution, involving different assumptions about the
composition of dense matter, are described. After its evolution into a nearly
isothermal neutron star a hundred or so years after its birth, it may be
observable through its thermal emission in X-rays during its life in the next
million years. Its surface temperature will depend upon the rapidity of
neutrino emission processes in its core, which depends on the composition of
dense matter and whether or not its constituents exhibit superfluidity and
superconductivity. Observations of thermal emission offer the best hope of a
determination of the radius of a neutron star. The implications for the
underlying dense matter equation of state of an accurate radius determination
are explored.

presence of two new phenomena connected with the dynamics of the solar
convective zone. Firstly, there are present torsional oscillations with periods
of about 11 years, which penetrate significantly into the solar convection zone
and secondly, oscillatory regimes exist near the base of the convection which
are markedly different from those observed near the top, having either
significantly reduced periods or being non-periodic.
  Recently spatiotemporal fragmentation/bifurcation has been proposed as a
possible dynamical mechanism to account for such observed multi-mode behaviours
in different parts of the solar convection zone. Evidence for this scenario was
produced in the context of an axisymmetric mean field dynamo model operating in
a spherical shell, with a semi-open outer boundary condition and a zero order
angular velocity obtained by the inversion of the MDI data, in which the only
nonlinearity was the action of the Lorentz force of the dynamo generated
magnetic field on the solar angular velocity.
  Here we make a detailed study of the robustness of this model with respect to
plausible changes to its main ingredients, including changes to the alpha and
eta profiles as well as the inclusion of a nonlinear alpha quenching. We find
that spatiotemporal fragmentation is present in this model for different
choices of the rotation data and as the details of the model are varied. Taken
together, these results give strong support to the idea that spatiotemporal
fragmentation is likely to occur in general dynamo settings.

H-alpha line emission from the DLA. After PSF subtraction, two weak features
are seen at projected separations of 0.16-0.24"" from the quasar. Parts of these
features may be associated with the DLA absorber, although we cannot completely
rule out that they could be artifacts of the point spread function (PSF). If
associated with the DLA, the objects would be ~1-2 h_{70}^{-1} kpc in size with
integrated flux densities of 2.5 and 3.3 mu Jy in the F160W filter, implying
luminosities at lambda_{central}=5600 A in the DLA rest frame of 4.4-5.9 x
10^{9} h_{70}^{-2} L_{solar} at z=1.86, for q0=0.5. However, no significant
H-alpha line emission is seen from these objects, suggesting low star formation
rates (SFRs). Our 3 sigma upper limit on the SFR in the DLA is 1.3 h_{70}^{-2}

This together with our earlier result for LBQS 1210+1731 mark a significant
improvement over previous constraints on the star formation rates of DLAs. A
combination of low SFR and some dust extinction is likely to be responsible for
the lack of H-alpha emission. Alternatively, the objects, may be associated
with the quasar host galaxy. In any case, our observations suggest that the DLA
is not a large bright proto-disk, but a compact object or a low-surface
brightness galaxy. If the two features are PSF artifacts then the constraints
on DLA properties are even more severe.

deflagration at the center of the star and soon several hydrodynamic
instabilities, in particular, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, begin to act. A
cellular stationary combustion and a turbulent combustion regime are rapidly
achieved by the flame and maintained up to the end of the so-called flamelet
regime when the transition to detonation is believed to occur. The burning
velocity at these regimes is well described by the fractal model of combustion.
Using a semi-analytic approach, we describe the effect of magnetic fields on
the fractalization of the front considering a white dwarf with a nearly dipolar
magnetic field. We find an intrinsic asymmetry on the velocity field that may
be maintained up to the free expansion phase of the remnant. Considering the
strongest values inferred for a white dwarf's magnetic fields with strengths up
to $10^{8}-10^{9}$ G at the surface and assuming that the field near the centre
is roughly 10 times greater, asymmetries in the velocity field higher than
$10-20 %$ are produced between the magnetic polar and the equatorial axis of
the remnant which may be related to the asymmetries found from recent
spectropolarimetric observations of very young SN Ia remnants. Dependence of
the asymmetry with white dwarf composition is also analyzed.

with similarly-measured distances for the Magellanic Clouds, and are able to
measure metallicity dependencies of the RR Lyrae and Cepheid distances by
requiring consistent relative distance measurements from the four techniques.
For metallicities of [Fe/H] = -1.3 (RR Lyraes) and -1.0 (Cepheids), we find a
relatively steep slope of 0.34 +/- 0.20 magnitudes per dex for the RR Lyraes

find that a dependence of the red clump absolute magnitude on age, in addition
to metallicity, is required to produce self-consistent relative distances
between IC 1613 and the Magellanic Clouds. Adopting such a red clump
calibration and self-consistent calibrations for the other three distance
indicators, we find that the distances to all three objects are in excellent

realizations of hierarchical galaxy formation. Outflows from dwarf galaxies
enrich the intergalactic medium inhomogeneously, at a rate depending on the
local galaxy density. Consequently, the first stars created in small
early-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in more
massive galaxies which typically form later. As most halo stars are likely to
originate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enriched
gas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old disk
stars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of our
predicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement with
observations. The broad and centrally peaked distribution of halo star
metallicities is well reproduced in our models, with a natural dispersion
depending on the exact accretion history. Our modeling includes the important
``baryonic stripping'' effect of early outflows, which brush away the tenuously
held gas in neighboring pre-virialized density perturbations. This stripping
process does not significantly modify the predicted shape of the halo star
metal distribution but inhibits star-formation and hence the number of accreted
stars, helping to reproduce the observed total Galactic halo luminosity and
also the lack of low-luminosity local dwarf galaxies relative to N-body
predictions.

due to satellite accretion. The results are positive. After the accretion of a
satellite, bulge-disk fits show that the bulge grows and that the bulge profile
index $n$ increases proportional to the satellite mass. For a satellite as
massive as the bulge, $n$ rises from 1 to 4. We present kinematic diagnostics
on the remnants and disk thickening. The latter suggests that the bulge growth
must have occurred before the last formation of a thin disk in the galaxy. The
thick disks created by the merger are reminiscent of thick disks seen in
early-type edge-on galaxies.

achieved a detection rate of emission-line objects (ELGs + QSOs) of 68%, among

BCGs have usually a blue colour ((B-R) < 1.0) and a non-stellar appearance in

between a scanning tunneling microscope tip and a substrate, superconductivity
has been detected at magnetic fields, which are few times larger than the third
(surface) critical field. We describe the observed phenomenon on the basis of a
numerical solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations in a model structure
consisting of six conoids. The spatial distribution of the superconducting
phase is shown to be strongly inhomogeneous, with concentration of the
superconducting phase near the narrowest part (the ``neck'') of the bridge. We
show that suppression of superconductivity in the bridge by applied magnetic
field or by temperature first occurs near the bases and then in the neck
region, what leads to a continuous superconducting-to-normal resistive
transition. A position of the transition midpoint depends on temperature and,
typically, is by one order of magnitude higher than the second critical field
H_c2. We find that the vortex states can be realized in the bridge at low
temperatures T/T_c < 0.6. The vortex states lead to a fine structure of the
superconducting-to-normal resistive transition. We also analyze vortex states
in the bridge, which are characterized by a varying vorticity as a function of
the bridge's height.

states the distribution corresponds to switching between long trains of
electrons going in opposite directions. For weak (gapless) superconductors or
tunnel junctions we find that at low temperatures the distribution has negative
`probabilities'. Accounting for the quantum mechanical nature of the measuring
device shows that these negative values can indeed be measured.

occurrence of a critical crack in a quasi two-dimensional disordered elastic
system. It turns out that this probability takes the form of an Arrhenius law
(as for thermal nucleation) but with the temperature T replaced by an effective
disorder temperature T_eff which depends on the strength of the disorder. The
extension of these results to d=3 dimensions is briefly discussed.

  We define a Fast Chirp Transform (FCT) analogous to the Fast Fourier

techniques provide a formalism for the detection of signals of constant
frequency. In particular, use of the FCT can alleviate the requirement of

(C-even state) and bremsstrahlung (C-odd state) production. We study the charge
asymmetry of pions in a differential in the pion momenta cross section
originating from an interference between these two mechanisms. At low effective
mass of dipions this asymmetry is directly related to the s- and p-phases of
elastic $\pi\pi$ scattering. At higher energies it can give new information
about the $f_0$ meson family, $f_2(1270)$ meson, etc. The asymmetry is
expressed via the pion form factor $F_\pi$ and helicity amplitudes $M_{ab}$ for
the subprocess $\gamma^*\gamma\to \pi^+\pi^-$ as $\sum G_{ab}{\rm
Re}(F_\pi^*M_{ab})$ where we have calculated analytically the coefficients
$G_{ab}$ for the region giving the main contribution to the effect. Several
distributions of pions are presented performing a numerical analysis in a model
with point-like pions. In the region near the dipion threshold the asymmetry is
of the order of 1%. We show that with suitable cuts the signal to background
ratio can be increased up to about 10%.

meson-bound states are expected to play a role. This interaction remains
subleading as compared to the effective one-gluon exchange contribution. The
local instanton induced four-quark interaction becomes dominant at a scale
around 800 MeV. In absence of a gluon mass the strong dependence of the

existence of two Pin groups offers a classification of fermions based on their
properties under space or time reversal finer than the classification based on
their properties under orientation preserving Lorentz transformations --
provided one can design experiments that distinguish the two types of fermions.
Many promising experimental setups give, for one reason or another, identical
results for both types of fermions. Two notable positive results show that the
existence of two Pin groups is relevant to physics:
  1) In a neutrinoless double beta decay, the neutrino emitted and reabsorbed
in the course of the interaction can only be described in terms of Pin(3,1).
  2) If a space is topologically nontrivial, the vacuum expectation values of
Fermi currents defined on this space can be totally different when described in
terms of Pin(1,3) and Pin(3,1).
  Possibly more important than the two above predictions, the Pin groups
provide a simple framework for the study of fermions; they make possible clear
definitions of intrinsic parities and time reversal. A section on Pin groups in

studied through the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices. We
demonstrate that classical chaos can lead to substantially enhanced
entanglement. Conversely, entanglement provides a novel and useful
characterization of quantum states in higher dimensional chaotic or complex
systems. Information about eigenfunction localization is stored in a graded
manner in the Schmidt vectors, and the principal Schmidt vectors can be scarred
by the projections of classical periodic orbits onto subspaces. The eigenvalues
of the reduced density matrices are sensitive to the degree of wavefunction
localization, and are roughly exponentially arranged. We also point out the
analogy with decoherence, as reduced density matrices corresponding to
subsystems of fully chaotic systems are diagonally dominant.

that QC2D with massive fermions undergoes a second-order transition to a

application we illustrate that the sigma= <bar-q q> .neq. 0 phase, which
determines the properties of the mass spectrum at zero temperature and chemical
potential, is unstable with respect to the superfluid phase when the chemical
potential exceeds approx. 2 sigma, and that at this point the diquark gap is
large, approx. 0.5 sigma. The superfluid phase survives to temperatures greater
than that expected in the core of compact stars.

motion has on Cooper pair formation in spherical superfluid nuclei. A
quantitative calculation of the state-dependent pairing gap requires to go
beyond the quasiparticle approximation, treating in detail the breaking of the
single-particle strength and of the associated poles. This is done solving
self-consistently the Dyson equation, including both a bare nucleon-nucleon
interaction (which for simplicity we choose as a monopole-pairing force of
constant matrix elements g) and an induced interaction arizing from the
exchange of vibrations (calculated microscopically in QRPA) between pairs of
nucleons moving in time reversal states. Both the normal and anomalous density
Green functions are included, thus treating self-energy and pairing processes
on equal footing. We apply the formalism to the superfluid nucleus 120Sn.
Adjusting the value of g so as to reproduce, for levels close to the Fermi
level, the empirical odd-even mass difference (Delta approx 1.4 MeV), it is
found that the pairing gap receives about equal contributions from the
monopole-pairing force and from the induced interaction. [More sentences
