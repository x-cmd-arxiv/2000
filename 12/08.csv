Chandra X-ray Observatory. The jet has at least four distinct features which
are not resolved in previous observations. The first knot in the jet (A1) is
very bright in X-rays. Its X-ray spectrum is well fitted with a power law with
alpha = 0.60 +/- 0.05. Combining this measurement with lower frequency data
shows that a pure synchrotron model can fit the spectrum of this knot from
1.647 GHz to 5 keV (over nine decades in energy) with alpha = 0.76 +/- 0.02,
similar to the X-ray spectral slope. Thus, we place a lower limit on the total
power radiated by this knot of 1.5e43 erg/s; substantially more power may be
emitted in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands.
  Knot A2 is also detected and is somewhat blended with knot B1. Synchrotron
emission may also explain the X-ray emission but a spectral bend is required
near the optical band. For knots A1 and B1, the X-ray flux dominates the
emitted energy. For the remaining optical knots (C through H), localized X-ray
enhancements that might correspond to the optical features are not clearly
resolved. The position angle of the jet ridge line follows the optical shape
with distinct, aperiodic excursions of +/-1 deg from a median value of
-138.0deg. Finally, we find X-ray emission from the ``inner jet'' between 5 and
10"" from the core.

The ~3% photometry provided by the Global Microlensing Alert Network follow--up
effort reveals a periodic modulation in the lightcurve. We attribute this to
binarity of the lensed source. Microlensing fits to a rotating binary source
magnified by a single lens converge on two minima, separated by delta chi^2 ~
1. The most significant fit X1 predicts a primary which contributes ~100% of
the light, a dark secondary, and an orbital period (T) of 9.2 days. The second
fit X2 yields a binary source with two stars of roughly equal mass and
luminosity, and T = 21.2 days.
  The lensed object appears to lie on the upper LMC main sequence. We estimate
the mass of the primary component of the binary system, M ~2 M_sun. For the
preferred model X1, we explore the range of dark companions by assuming 0.1
M_sun and 1.4 M_sun objects in models X1a and X1b, respectively. We find lens
velocities projected to the LMC in these models of v^hat_X1a = 18.3 +/- 3.1
km/s and v^hat_X1b = 188 +/- 32 k/ms. In both these cases, a likelihood
analysis suggests an LMC lens is preferred over a Galactic halo lens, although
only marginally so in model X1b. We also find v^hat_X2 = 39.6 +/- 6.1 k/ms,
where the likelihood for the lens location is strongly dominated by the LMC
disk. In all cases, the lens mass is consistent with that of an M-dwarf. The
LMC self-lensing rate contributed by 96-LMC-2 is consistent with model
self-lensing rates. (Abridged)

The BBD is an extension of the galaxy luminosity function incorporating surface
brightness information. It allows the measurement of the local luminosity
density, j_B, and the galaxy luminosity and surface brightness distributions
while accounting for surface brightness selection biases. The recovered 2dFGRS
BBD shows a strong surface brightness-luminosity relation (M_B~2.4\mu_e). The
luminosity-density is dominated by normal galaxies and the luminosity-density
peak lies away from the selection boundaries implying that the 2dFGRS is
complete and that luminous low surface brightness galaxies are rare. The final
value we derive for the local luminosity-density, inclusive of surface
brightness corrections, is: j_B=2.49+/-0.20x10^8 h L_solar Mpc^-3.

selected from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey (CNOC2). This survey allows the identification of a large
number of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weak
lensing analysis of their mass distribution. For our analysis we use a sample
of 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis of
group candidates. We detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. The best fit
singular isothermal sphere model yields an Einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29"". This
corresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometric
redshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreement
with the dynamical estimate. Under the assumption that the light traces the
mass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h Msun/Lsun in the
restframe B band. Unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive to
problems associated with determining group membership. After correction of the
observed mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110
h Msun/Lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. We use the observed
mass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for which

certain than for the 11 non-nucleated objects since it relies on an
extrapolation of galaxy light under the nucleus. In terms of their light
profiles and nuclear properties, most spheroidal stellar systems can be broadly
divided into two subclasses: the exponential shallow cusp objects and the

this as evidence that the high-ionization lines come from a wind, while the
low-ionization lines are emitted from the accretion disk or low-velocity base
of the wind. The optically thick disk blocks our view of the receding wind. We
also found that not all NLS1s display strongly blueshifted emission lines, and
the degree of asymmetry is inversely correlated with the equivalent width and
correlated with the SiIII] to CIII] ratio, a density indicator. It may also be
significant that these NLS1s display the extreme in the X-ray properties: they
have the strongest X-ray soft-excess components and the highest-amplitude,
flaring variability. We postulate that this combination of properties are all
related to a high value of L/M_BH, even among NLS1s. The high-ionization and
low-ionization lines are nearly completely kinematically separated, a fact that
allows us to study the conditions in the disk and wind separately.(...)

the latest available radio pulsar timing data is presented here, allowing us to
determine approximately the mass and orbital parameters of the second

eccentricity e2 ~0.45 and with a large semimajor axis a2 ~60 AU. The short
dynamical lifetime of this very wide triple in M4 suggests that large numbers
of such planets must be present in globular clusters. We also address the
question of the anomalously high eccentricity of the inner binary pulsar. While
this eccentricity could have been induced during the same dynamical interaction
that created the triple, we find that it could also naturally arise from
long-term secular perturbation effects in the triple, combining the general

for Omega_0=1 world models.
  At the modest (off-axis) resolution of the ROSAT PSPC observation in which
the system was detected, ClJ1226.9+3332 appears relaxed; an off-axis HRI
observation confirms this impression and rules out significant contamination
from point sources. However, in moderately deep optical images (R and I band)
the cluster exhibits signs of substructure in its apparent galaxy distribution.
A first crude estimate of the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies based
on six redshifts yields a high value of 1650 km/s, indicative of a very massive
cluster and/or the presence of substructure along the line of sight. While a
more accurate assessment of the dynamical state of this system requires much
better data at both optical and X-ray wavelengths, the high mass of the cluster
has already been unambiguously confirmed by a very strong detection of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in its direction (Joy et al. 2001).
  Using ClJ1226.9+3332 and ClJ0152.7-1357 (z=0.835), the second-most distant
X-ray luminous cluster currently known and also a WARPS discovery, we obtain a
first estimate of the cluster X-ray luminosity function at 0.8<z<1.4 and
L_X>5e44 erg/s. Using the best currently available data, we find the comoving
space density of very distant, massive clusters to be in excellent agreement
with the value measured locally (z<0.3), and conclude that negative evolution
is not required at these luminosities out to z~1. (truncated)

were selected according to their dust envelope class (as suggested by Sloan,
Little-Marenin & Price, 1998) and 11 are extreme carbon stars. The models were
performed using a code that describes the radiative transfer in dust envelopes
considering core/mantle grains composed by an alpha-SiC core and an amorphous
carbon (A.C.) mantle. In addition, we have also computed models with a code
that considers two kinds of grains - alpha-SiC and A.C. - simultaneously.
Core-mantle grains seem to fit dust envelopes of evolved carbon stars, while
two homogeneous grains are more able to reproduce thinner dust envelopes. Our
results suggest that there exists an evolution of dust grains in the carbon
star sequence. In the beginning of the sequence, grains are mainly composed of
SiC and amorphous carbon; with dust envelope evolution, carbon grains are
coated in SiC. This phenomena could perhaps explain the small quantity of SiC
grains observed in the interstellar medium. However, in this work we consider
only alpha-SiC grains, and the inclusion of beta-SiC grains can perhaps change
some of there results.

an independent confirmation of the existence of alignments of quasar
polarization vectors on very large scales. In total, out of 29 polarized
quasars located in this region of the sky, 25 have their polarization vectors
coherently oriented. This alignment occurs at redshifts 1-2 suggesting the
presence of correlations in objects or fields on Gpc scales. More global
statistical tests applied to the whole sample of polarized quasars distributed
all over the sky confirm that polarization vectors are coherently oriented in a
few groups of 20-30 quasars. Some constraints on the phenomenon are also
derived. Considering more particularly the quasars in the selected region of
the sky, we found that their polarization vectors are roughly parallel to the
plane of the Local Supercluster. But the polarization vectors of objects along
the same line of sight at lower redshifts are not accordingly aligned. We also
found that the known correlations between quasar intrinsic properties and

research within the area of Strongly Correlated Electrons. After considerable
theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided by computational and
mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable progress has been achieved
in understanding the curious properties of these compounds. These recent
studies suggest that the ground states of manganite models tend to be
intrinsically inhomogeneous due to the presence of strong tendencies toward
phase separation, typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and
antiferromagnetic charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations
of the resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good
agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins: (i)
electronic phase separation between phases with different densities that lead
to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced phase
separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density phases,
driven by disorder near first-order metal-insulator transitions. The coexisting
clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer in size. It is argued
that a large variety of experiments reviewed in detail here contain results
compatible with the theoretical predictions. It is concluded that manganites
reveal such a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena that their
detailed study is quite important for progress in the field of Correlated
Electrons.

from which correlations can be calculated. The functional roles of correlations
can be revealed by the measures of the information conveyed by neuronal
activity; a simple formula has been shown to discriminate the information
transmitted by individual spikes from the positive or negative contributions
due to correlations (Panzeri et al, Proc. Roy. Soc. B., {266}: 1001--1012
(1999)). The formula quantifies the corrections to the single-unit
instantaneous information rate which result from correlations in spike emission
between pairs of neurons. Positive corrections imply synergy, while negative
corrections indicate redundancy. Here, this analysis, previously applied to
recordings from small ensembles, is developed further by considering a model of
a large ensemble, in which correlations among the signal and noise components
of neuronal firing are small in absolute value and entirely random in origin.
Even such small random correlations are shown to lead to large possible synergy
or redundancy, whenever the time window for extracting information from
neuronal firing extends to the order of the mean interspike interval. In
addition, a sample of recordings from rat barrel cortex illustrates the mean
time window at which such `corrections' dominate when correlations are, as
often in the real brain, neither random nor small. The presence of this kind of
correlations for a large ensemble of cells restricts further the time of
validity of the expansion, unless what is decodable by the receiver is also

g(Gamma*beta_L)*f(alpha_I,beta_L), where now f also depends on alpha_I. For

one finds an infinite family of sphaleron-like solutions mediating transitions
between different topological sectors. We review these solutions for two

show the existence of sphaleron excitations of monopoles in the NBI theory with

difference is interpreted as the cosmological constant. All three approaches
are reviewed, with an emphasis on recent work. It is hoped that this review is
comprehensive in scope. There is a discussion on whether there is a relation
between vacuum energy and inertia. The solution suggested here to the nature of
the vacuum is that Casimir energy can produce short range effects because of
boundary conditions, but that at long range there is no overall effect of
vacuum energy, unless one considers lagrangians of higher order than Einstein's
as vacuum induced. No original calculations are presented in support of this
position. This is not a review of the cosmological constant {\it per se}, but
rather vacuum energy in general, my approach to the cosmological constant is

$K$-affinoid varieties. In this paper we study the analytic structure of the
image $f(Y)\subset X$; such an image is a typical example of a subanalytic set.
Using Embedded Resolution of Singularities, we derive in the zero
characteristic case a Uniformization Theorem for subanalytic sets: after
finitely many local blowing ups with smooth centres, a subanalytic set becomes
semi-analytic. To prove this we establish a Flattening Theorem for affinoid
varieties in the style of Hironaka, which allows a reduction to the study of
subanalytic sets arising from flat maps. Specifically we show that a map of
affinoid varieties can be rendered flat by using only finitely many local
blowing ups. The case of an image under a flat map is then dealt with by a
small extension of a result of Raynaud.
  Our result can be conveniently stated as a Quantifier Elimination theorem for
the valuation ring $R$ in an analytic expansion of the language of valued
fields. This formulation is in the style of Denef and van den Dries.
