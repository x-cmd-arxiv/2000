neutron stars (NS), with the unique characteristic that none of the two NS ever
had the chance to be recycled by accretion. The existence of this channel stems
from the evolution of helium-rich stars (cores of massive NS progenitors),
which has been neglected in most previous studies of double compact object
formation. We find that these non-recycled NS-NS binaries are formed from bare
carbon-oxygen cores in tight orbits, with formation rates comparable to or
maybe even higher than those of recycled NS-NS binaries. On the other hand,
their detection probability as binary pulsars is greatly reduced (by about
1000) relative to recycled pulsars, because of their short lifetimes. We
conclude that, in the context of gravitational-wave detection of NS-NS inspiral
events, this new type of binaries calls for an increase of the rate estimates
derived from the observed NS-NS with recycled pulsars, typically by factors of
1.5-3 or even higher.

AKO 9, a UV-bright and highly variable 1.1 day binary system in 47 Tuc. AKO 9
is the brightest FUV source in our data and presents a blue FUV spectrum with

consistent with earlier X-ray observations of Zeta Ori. Many lines are
spectrally resolved showing Doppler broadening of 900 +/- 200 km/s. The
observed He-like ions (O VII, Ne IX, Mg XI, and Si XIII) provide information
about the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission. Although the observations
support a wind distribution of X-ray sources, we find three conflicting
results. First, line diagnostics for SIXIII indicate that this line emission
forms very close to the stellar surface, where the density is of order 10^{12}
cm^{-3}, but the velocity there is too small to produce the shock jump required
for the observed ionization level. Second, the strong X-ray line profiles are
symmetric and do not show any evidence of Doppler blue-shifted line centroids
which are expected to accompany an outwardly moving source in a high density
wind. Third, the observed velocity dispersions do not appear to correlate with
the associated X-ray source radii velocities, contrary to expectations of wind
distributed source models. A composite source model involving wind shocks and
some magnetic confinement of turbulent hot plasma in a highly non-symmetric
wind, appears to be needed to explain the line diagnostic anomalies.

redshift, rest-frame visible asymmetry and concentration, bolometric luminosity
and extinction-corrected star formation rate. We find only one strong
correlation, between bolometric luminosity and star formation rate, from which
early-type galaxies noticeably deviate. When our asymmetry measurements are
combined with those of a sample of nearby galaxies covering the full Hubble
sequence, we find a weak correlation between redshift and rest-frame visible
asymmetry, consistent with the qualitative evidence of galaxy morphological
evolution from these and other deep Hubble Space Telescope images. The mean
values of these asymmetry measurements show a monotonic increase with redshift
interval over the range 0 < z < 2, increasing by a factor of approximately
three. If this trend is real, it suggests that galaxy morphological evolution
is a gradual process that is continuing through the present cosmological epoch.
There is evidence that the dominant source of this evolution is the ""minor""
mergers of disk galaxies with smaller companions, which could also transform
late-type spiral galaxies into early-type spiral galaxies. Interestingly, in
contrast to local galaxies we find no correlations between star formation rate
and either UV or visible asymmetry. This could arise if the star formation of
high-redshift galaxies proceeds in episodes that are short (~ 100 Myr) relative
to the time scales over which galaxy mergers produce strong asymmetries (~ 500
Myr), a result suggested by the high star formation rates of Lyman break
galaxies.

HE2347-4342. Compared to the previous HST GHRS data obtained by Reimers et al.
(1997), the STIS spectrum has a much improved resolution. The 2-D detector also
allows us to better characterize the sky and dark background. We confirm the
presence of two spectral ranges of much reduced opacity, the opacity gaps, and
provide improved lower limits on the HeII G-P opacity in the high opacity
regions. We use the STIS spectrum together with a Keck--HIRES spectrum covering
the corresponding HI Lya forest to calculate a 1-D map of the softness S of the
ionization radiation along the line of sight towards HE 2347-4342, where S is
the ratio of the HI to HeII photoionization rates. We find that S is generally
large but presents important variations, from S ~ 30 in the opacity gaps to a 1
sigma lower limit of 2300 at z~2.86, in a region which shows an extremely low
HI opacity over a 6.5 A range. We note that a large S naturally accounts for
most of the large SiIV to CIV ratios seen in other quasar absorption line
spectra. We present a simple model that reproduces the shape of the opacity
gaps in absence of large individual absorption lines. We extend the model
described in Heap et al. (2000) to account for the presence of sources close to
the line of sight of the background quasar. As an alternative to the delayed
reionization model suggested by Reimers et al. (1997), we propose that the
large softness observed at z~2.86 is due to the presence of bright soft sources
close to the line of sight, i.e. for which the ratio between the number of HI
to HeII ionizing photons reaching the IGM is large. We discuss these two models
and suggest ways to discriminate between them.

that the density and temperature profiles of the hot interstellar medium imply
a Bondi accretion rate of Mdot_{Bondi} \sim 3 10^{-2} Msun/yr. This accretion
rate predicts a nuclear luminosity of \sim 10^{44} erg/s for a canonical
radiative efficiency of 10%. Unless the Bondi estimate is inappropriate and/or
the accretion rate onto the black hole is significantly reduced, the observed
nuclear flux constrains the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow to be

radial density profiles \rho \approxpropto r^{-3/2} (and not significantly
flatter) can explain the observed nuclear X-ray luminosity but that the power
output from the jets in NGC 6166 is also important to the energetics of the

anisotropy in the low-redshift universe. We present analytic predictions for
the CMB power spectrum from massive halos arising from the SZ effect. Since
halos are discrete, the power spectrum consists of a Poisson and a correlation
term. The latter is always smaller than the former, which is dominated by
nearby bright rich clusters. In practice however, those bright clusters are
easy to indentify and can thus be subtracted from the map. After this
subtraction, the correlation term dominates degree-scale fluctuations over the
Poisson term, as the main contribution to the correlation term comes from
distant clusters. We find that the correlation term is detectable by Planck
experiment. Since the degree scale spectrum is quite insensitive to the highly
uncertain core structures of halos, our predictions are robust on these scales.
Measuring the correlation term on degree scales thus cleanly probes the
clustering of distant halos. This has not been measured yet, mainly because
optical and X-ray surveys are not sufficiently sensitive to include such
distant clusters and groups. Our analytic predictions are also compared to
adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations. The agreement is remarkably good, down to
ten arcminutes scales, indicating that our predictions are robust for the
Planck experiment. Below ten arcminute scales, where the details of the core
structure dominates the power spectrum, our analytic and simulated predictions
might fail. In the near future, interferometer and bolometer array experiments
will measure the SZ power spectrum down to arcminutes scales, and yield new
insight into the physics of the intrahalo medium.

non-Gaussianity. Thus, measuring the non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave
background radiation anisotropy is a probe of the non-linear physics in the
very early universe. Since the angular three point function is zero for the
Gaussian field, it is sensitive to the non-Gaussianity. We predict its harmonic
transform counterpart, the angular {\it Bispectrum}, down to arcminutes angular
scales, including the full effect of the radiation transfer function. We find
that even the Planck experiment cannot detect the primary bispectrum from the
inflation, as long as the single field slow-roll inflation is right.
Non-linearities in the low redshift universe also produce the non-Gaussianity.
We find that secondary bispectra are detectable by both MAP and Planck
experiments. The secondary bispectra probe the non-linear physics of the
low-redshift universe. Although this could be a contaminant to the primary
signal, MAP and Planck experiments are found to be able to separate the primary
from secondary effects well. We present a tentative comparison of the primary
bispectrum to the published COBE 4 year bispectrum. The data put a weak
constraint on the parameter, and the constraint would become much tighter when
we use all modes available in the COBE data, and certainly forthcoming

confirm or destroy the simple inflationary scenario in non-linear order that

we study the shape of the CUS peaks for different relative lengths of the

part) and the elastic slope are fully predicted, as well as the effective
Pomeron trajectory in impact parameter space, in a good agreement with data.
These results naturally explain the x-dependence of the diffractive DIS
observed at HERA. Although diffraction is expected to be dominated by soft
interactions the observed effective \Delta is about twice as large as one
(0.08) known for total cross sections. Diffractive excitations of large

inversely proportional to masses that are not exponentially suppressed. The
hierarchy between the gravitational and weak interactions is nevertheless
preserved on the visible brane due to suppression of gravitational interactions
on that brane. The towers of Kaluza-Klein states for bulk fields are observed
to have different spacings on different branes when all masses are measured in

dual to a CFT in the infinite momentum frame with constant momentum density. If
correct, this implies that the CFT must resolve the singularity of the bulk

conformal symmetries determine the scalar 2-point function up to an arbitrary

  An important class of ruled SL 3-folds is the special Lagrangian cones in

family of ruled SL 3-folds N asymptotic to a fixed SL cone N_0. We find that
this depends on solving a linear equation, so that the family of such N has the
structure of a vector space. We also show that the intersection Sigma of N_0
with the unit sphere in C^3 is a Riemann surface, and construct a ruled SL
3-fold N asymptotic to N_0 for each holomorphic vector field w on Sigma.

3-folds depending on a holomorphic function on C, which include many new
examples of singularities of SL 3-folds. We also show that each SL T^2 cone N_0
can be extended to a 2-parameter family of ruled SL 3-folds asymptotic to N_0,

polarization vector, which connects the four-vector potential with creation and
annihilation operators, is given in terms of boosts, coset representatives of
the Lorentz group with respect to the Euclidian group. Several polarization
vectors (boost choices) are worked out, including a front form polariation
vector. The different boost choices are shown to be related by the analogue of
Melosh rotations, namely Euclidian group transformations.

  Operators","16 pages; revised version adds notion of dynamically determined few
  body currents",,,,"nucl-th",,"  A general procedure for constructing conserved electromagnetic current
operators, for both finite and infinite degree of freedom systems, is given. A
four-momentum operator consisting of matter, photon, and electromagnetic
interactions is assumed to be polynomial in photon creation and annihilation
operators. Commutators of the four-momentum operator with the four-vector
potential operator at the space-time point zero give the electromagnetic field
tensor and current operator at the space-time point zero. In this construction
there are no equations of motion to be satisfied and field operators at an
arbitrary space-time point-defined as the four-momentum translates of the
corresponding operators at the space-time point zero-are not local operators.
Several examples are given to show how the construction is carried out.

rectangular, three dimensional cavity with one oscillating wall. For some
particular values of the frequency of the oscillations the system is resonant.
We solve the field equation using multiple scale analysis and show that the
total number of photons inside the cavity grows exponentially in time. This is
also the case for slightly off-resonance situations. Although the spectrum of a
cavity is in general non equidistant, we show that the modes of the
electromagnetic field can be coupled, and that the rate of photon creation
strongly depends on this coupling. We also analyze the thermal enhancement of
the photon creation.
