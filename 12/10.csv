systematic effect on measurements of cosmic shear statistics, known as the
source-lens clustering (SLC) effect. The SLC effect on the skewness of lensing
convergence, $S_3$, is examined using a nonlinear semi-analytic approach and is
checked against numerical simulations. The semi-analytic calculations have been
performed in a wide variety of generic models for the redshift distribution of
source galaxies and power-law models for the bias parameter between the galaxy
and dark matter distributions. The semi-analytic predictions are tested
successfully against numerical simulations. We find the relative amplitude of
the SLC effect on $S_3$ to be of the order of five to forty per cent. It
depends significantly on the redshift distribution of sources and on the way
the bias parameter evolves. We discuss possible measurement strategies to
minimize the SLC effects.

compare the constraints on cluster mass profiles that can be obtained using the
shear and magnification information. This work considered circularly symmetric
power-law models for clusters at fairly low redshifts where the redshift
distribution of source galaxies could be neglected. Here this treatment is
extended to encompass NFW profiles which are a good description of clusters
from cosmological N-body simulations, and NFW clusters at higher redshifts
where the influence of various scenarios for the knowledge of the redshift
distribution are examined. Since in reality the overwhelming majority of
clusters have ellipsoidal rather than spherical profiles, the singular
isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) is investigated. We also briefly consider the impact
of substructure on such a likelihood analysis. In general, we find that the
shear information provides a better constraint on the NFW profile under
consideration, so this becomes the focus of what follows. The ability to
differentiate between the NFW and power-law profiles strongly depends on the
size of the data field, and on the number density of galaxies for which an
ellipticity can be measured. For higher redshift NFW profiles, there is very
little reduction (~1.5%) in the dispersion of parameter estimates when
spectroscopic redshifts, as opposed to photometric redshift estimates, are
available for the galaxies used in the lensing analysis.

incorrect solutions in the literature are corrected here. A simple yet accurate

Sheth & Tormen (1999), and Lee & Shandarin (1999). The $\sigma_8$ based on the

the larger mass function within the scale range of our interest. In particular,

$\alpha=-0.3-0.17\Omega_{\rm m0}^{0.34}-0.13\Omega_{\Lambda 0}$. We also derive

The article aims to give a pedagogical discussion of what is meant by the

may be calculated using path integral and discrete phase integral methods. In
the case of Fe8, an issue of great interest is the oscillatory tunnel
splittings as a function of applied magnetic field that have recently been
observed. These oscillations are due to the occurrence of diabolical points in
the magnetic field space. It is shown how this effect comes about in both the
path-integral and the discrete phase integral methods. In the former it arises
due to the presence of a Berry-like phase in the action, which gives rise to an
interference between tunneling trajectories. In the latter, it arises due to
the presence of further neighbor terms in the recursion relation for the energy
eigenfunction. These terms give rise to turning points which have no analog in
the one-dimensional continuum quasiclassical method. Explicit results are
obtained for the location of the diabolical points in Fe8.

the level spacing, $d$, is larger than the bulk superconducting gap, $\Delta$,

and numerically. The condensation energy, spin magnetization and tunneling peak
spectrum are calculated analytically in the ultrasmall regime, using an
approximation controlled by $1/\ln N$ as small parameter, where $N$ is the
number of interacting electron pairs. The condensation energy in this regime is
perturbative in the coupling constant $\lambda$, and is proportional to $d N
\lambda^2 = \lambda^2 \omega_D$. We find that also in a large regime with
$\Delta>d$, in which pairing correlations are already rather well developed,
the perturbative part of the condensation energy is larger than the singular,
BCS, part. The condition for the condensation energy to be well approximated by
the BCS result is found to be roughly $\Delta > \sqrt{d \omega_D}$. We show how
the condensation energy can, in principle, be extracted from a measurement of
the spin magnetization curve, and find a re-entrant susceptibility at zero
temperature as a function of magnetic field, which can serve as a sensitive
probe for the existence of superconducting correlations in ultrasmall grains.

1/N correction to the BCS result for the condensation energy is larger than
$\Delta$.

significance with which the signal of a Higgs decaying to t \bar t pairs could
be observed at future e^+ e^- linear colliders, with center of mass energies
close to 1 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab^{-1}. We find that a signal
significance greater than 5 \sigma and a relative error in the top Yukawa
measurement better than 10% can be achieved, for Higgs masses in the 350-500
GeV and 350-650 GeV ranges at facilities with 800 GeV and 1 TeV energies
respectively.

Fuchs and S. Tabachnikov who showed that the groups of complex-valued Vassiliev
invariants of Legendrian and of framed knots in the standard contact $R^3$ are
canonically isomorphic.
  Recently we constructed the first examples where Vassiliev invariants of
Legendrian and of framed knots are different, and Vassiliev invariants of
Legendrian knots distinguish Legendrian knots that are isotopic as framed knots
and homotopic as Legendrian immersions. This raised the question what
information about Legendrian knots can be captured using Vassiliev invariants.
  Here we answer this question by showing that for any contact 3-manifold with
a cooriented contact structure the groups of Vassiliev invariants of Legendrian
knots and of knots that are nowhere tangent to a vector field that coorients
the contact structure are canonically isomorphic.

four-manifold with b_+(X) > 1+b_1(X) and with some positive multiple of the

of X may be represented by an embedded symplectic submanifold. The result
builds on the existence of Lefschetz pencils on symplectic four-manifolds. We
approach the topological problem of constructing submanifolds with locally
positive intersections via almost complex geometry. The crux of the argument is
that a Gromov invariant counting pseudoholomorphic sections of an associated
bundle of symmetric products is non-zero.

first bifurcation analysis of the model, for a tractable special case. The
system displays rich collective dynamics as a function of the coupling strength
and the spread of natural frequencies. Besides incoherence, frequency locking,
and oscillator death, there exist novel hybrid solutions that combine two or
more of these states. We present the phase diagram and derive several of the
stability boundaries analytically.

  condensates with time-dependent asymmetric trap potential","Retex, 20 Pages, 9 PS figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We have investigated the chaotic atomic population oscillations between two
coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with time-dependent asymmetric trap
potential. In the perturbative regime, the population oscillations can be
described by the Duffing equation, and the chaotic oscillations near the
separatrix solution are analyzed. The sufficient-necessary conditions for
stable oscillations depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions
sensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov
function is equal to zero, so the stable oscillations are Melnikov chaotic. For
the ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is
simulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the
increasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic
gradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a
single island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea. For the completely
chaotic oscillations, the long-term localization disappears and the short-term
localization can be changed from one of the BECs to the other through the route
of Rabi oscillation. When there exists damping, the stationary chaos
disappears, the transient chaos is a common phenomenon before regular stable
frequency locked oscillations. And proper damping can keep localization
long-lived.
