each cluster in a fully homogeneous way. Furthermore, the availability of
virtually unlimited sky coverage allows us to directly compute the LF errors
without having to rely on the estimated variance of the background. The wide
field coverage also allows us to derive the LF of the whole cluster, including
galaxies located in the cluster outskirts. The global composite LF has a slope
alpha ~ -1.1+/-0.2 with minor variations from blue to red filters, and M* ~
-21.7,-22.2,-22.4 mag (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc) in g, r and i filters, respectively.
These results are in quite good agreement with several previous determinations

overlapping set of clusters, but derived making use of a completely different
method for background subtraction. The similarity of the two LFs suggests the
existence of minor differences between the LF in the cluster outskirts and in

suggest that Kurucz models underestimate the FUV flux of main-sequence B stars
between these two Lyman lines. Computation of flux distributions of
line-blanketed model atmospheres including non-LTE effects suggests that this
flux underestimate could be due to departures from LTE, although other causes
cannot be ruled out. We found the common assumption of solar metallicity for
young disk stars should be made with care, since small deviations can have a
significant impact on FUV model fluxes. Two peculiar stars (rho Leo and epsilon
Aqr), and two emission line stars (epsilon Cap and pi Aqr) were also studied.
Of these, only epsilon Aqr has a flux in agreement with the models. The rest
have strong variability in the IUE range and/or uncertain reddening, which
makes the comparison with models difficult.

typical of densities found in the solar active regions, and also pressures and
temperatures in Procyon's and Capella's corona at a level of T=10^6K are quite

Comparison of our Capella and Procyon measurements with the Sun shows little
difference in the physical properties of the layers producing the CV, NVI, and
OVII emission. Assuming the X-ray emitting plasma to be confined in magnetic
loops, we obtain typical loop length scales of L_Capella > 8 L_Procyon from the
loop scaling laws, implying that the magnetic structures in Procyon and Capella
are quite different. The total mean surface fluxes emitted in the helium- and

Pleiades. Evidence for variability with RMS amplitudes (in the I band) of 0.01
to 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half of
these objects. Power spectral analysis using the CLEAN algorithm was performed
to search for evidence of periodic variability. Some objects show strong
periodicities at around a few hours, which could be due to rotational
modulation of the light curve by surface features. However, several objects do
not have any significant periodicities to explain their variability. The vsini
values of a similar population of objects makes it very likely that our time
sampling was sensitive to the expected range of rotation periods, and
simulations show that we would have detected these if they were caused by
long-lived surface features. We argue that this absence of periodicity is due
to the evolution of the brightness, and presumably also the physical size, of
surface features on timescales of a few to a few tens of hours. This is
supported in the case of 2M1145 for which two light curves have been obtained
one year apart and show no common periodicity. The surface features could
plausibly be photospheric dust clouds or magnetically-induced spots. The
recently observed decline in chromospheric activity for late type M and L
dwarfs hints towards the former explanation for at least our later-type
objects. Furthermore, our sample suggests that variability to be more common in
objects later than M9, indicating that the variability may be related to dust
formation. One light curve shows a brief, but significant, dip, which could be
a short-lived feature or possibly an eclipse by a companion. (abridged)

  Properties of the Gamma Rays","Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations suggest that gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows
are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in supernova explosions. We
have proposed that the result of the event is not just a compact object plus
the ejecta: within days, a fraction of the parent star falls back to produce a
thick accretion disk. The subsequent accretion generates jets and constitutes
the GRB ``engine'', as in the observed ejection of relativistic ``cannonballs''
of plasma by microquasars and active galactic nuclei. Here we investigate the
production of a GRB as the jetted cannonballs exit the supernova shell reheated
by their collision with it, emitting highly forward-collimated radiation. Each
cannonball corresponds to an individual pulse in a GRB. We cannot predict the
timing sequence of these pulses, but the Cannonball Model fares very well in
describing the total energy, energy spectrum, and time-dependence of the
individual pulses.

coincident with the nucleus of the giant radio galaxy, 3C236. The nuclear radio
structure is composed of two complexes of emission which are resolved on scales
from 1 milli-arcsec (mas) to 1 arcsec. Oscillations with an amplitude of about
5 degrees can be seen in the compact radio structure. Spectral index
distributions are plotted at angular resolutions of 10 and 25 mas and allow us
to identify the core component in the south-east emission complex.
Re-examination of the HST WFPC-2 image of 3C236 by de Koff et al. (2000), shows
that the normal to the dust disk in the nucleus is ~30 degrees from the plane
of the sky and within 12 degrees of parallel to the overall orientation of the
radio source. We suggest that the radio axis is also at an angle of ~30 degrees
to the plane of the sky and that the north-west jet is on the approaching side.
This orientation implies an overall size of 4.5 Mpc (H_o = 75 km/s/Mpc, q_o =
0.5) for 3C236. The coincidence of a dust feature and the south-east compact
jet, within the astrometric errors, leads us to suggest that the dust may be in
the form of a cloud encountered by the jet in the first ~400 pc of its journey
out from the nucleus. One-sided emission at 5 GHz on 1 mas scales would suggest
that the jets are ejected initially at <= 35 degrees to the line of sight, but
this is difficult to reconcile with the obvious orientation stability of the
jet system as a whole. Free-free absorption of the counter-jet may be an
alternative explanation for the one-sideness.

that the merger events redistributes efficiently the metal content of the

the observed abundance excess is due to metals ejected from the galaxies

from a deprojected metal excess distribution tracing the optical light
distribution. In the one case (i.e. Perseus) with higher resolution (~ 50 kpc),
we find that the observed metal abundance excess distribution is broader than
the predicted one. Such a difference can be reconciled if we assume that the
metals have drifted away from their parent ejecting galaxies by a few tens of
kpc, or, alternatively, if we assume that the cluster light profile has become
significantly more centrally peaked because of the formation process of the
central dominant cluster galaxy since the last major merger occurred.

sight lines of only 2.5 deg, rather fluffy. The fractional abundance of H_2

typical for galactic disk gas. In the IV and HV gas an apparent underabundance
of neutral oxygen points to an ionization level of the gas of about 90%. H_2 is
detected in IV and HV gas toward HD 269546. In the IV gas we find an H_2 column
density of log(N)\simeq15.6. The H_2 excitation indicates that the line of
sight samples a cloud at a temperature below 150 K. Column densities are too
small to detect the higher UV pumped excitation levels. The high velocity H_2

This structure has been explored by photoelectron diffraction experiments
performed at the ALOISA beamline of the Elettra storage ring in Trieste

the backscattering of the underneath Ge atoms, has been measured as a function
of the emission angle at fixed kinetic energies and viceversa. The bond angle
between Sn and its nearest neighbour atoms in the first Ge layer (Sn-Ge1) has
been measured by taking polar scans along the main symmetry directions and it
was found almost equivalent for the two components. The corresponding bond
lengths are also quite similar, as obtained by studying the dependence on the
photoelectron kinetic energy, while keeping the photon polarization and the
collection direction parallel to the Sn-Ge1 bond orientation (bond emission). A
clear difference between the two bonding sites is observed when studying the
energy dependence at normal emission, where the sensitivity to the Sn height
above the Ge atom in the second layer is enhanced. This vertical distance is
found to be 0.3 Angstroms larger for one Sn atom out of the three contained in

that support \emph{concurrent} client accesses. The ability to process large
volumes of simultaneous requests is critical in many such applications. In such
a setting, the traditional approach of serving these requests one at a time via
queues (e.g. \textsf{FIFO} queues, priority queues) is insufficient.
Alternative models are essential to improve the performance of such
\emph{heavily loaded} agents. In this paper, we propose a set of
\emph{cost-based algorithms} to \emph{optimize} and \emph{merge} multiple
requests submitted to an agent. In order to merge a set of requests, one first
needs to identify commonalities among such requests. First, we provide an
\emph{application independent framework} within which an agent developer may
specify relationships (called \emph{invariants}) between requests. Second, we
provide two algorithms (and various accompanying heuristics) which allow an
agent to automatically rewrite requests so as to avoid redundant work---these
algorithms take invariants associated with the agent into account. Our
algorithms are independent of any specific agent framework. For an
implementation, we implemented both these algorithms on top of the \impact
agent development platform, and on top of a (non-\impact) geographic database
agent. Based on these implementations, we conducted experiments and show that
our algorithms are considerably more efficient than methods that use the $A^*$
algorithm.

simulations which validate as well as illustrate the limits of the theory.
Finally, we verify that the assumptions of our model apply to the parameter
regimes explored in recent physical experiments in which gap solitons were
observed.

Weinstein","Parametrically Excited Hamiltonian Partial Differential Equations","To appear in SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis; 47 pages",,,,"nlin.PS nlin.CD",,"  Consider a linear autonomous Hamiltonian system with a time periodic bound
state solution. In this paper we study the structural instability of this bound
state ^M relative to time almost periodic perturbations which are small,
localized and Hamiltonian.
  This class of perturbations includes those whose time dependence is periodic,
but encompasses a large class of those with finite (quasiperiodic) or
infinitely many non-commensurate frequencies. Problems of the type considered
arise in many areas of application including ionization physics and the
propagation of light in optical fibers in the presence of defects.
  The mechanism of instability is radiation damping due to resonant coupling of
the bound state to the continuum modes by the time-dependent perturbation. This
results in a transfer of energy from the discrete modes to the continuum. The
rate of decay of solutions is slow and hence the decaying bound states can be
viewed as metastable. These results generalize those of A. Soffer and M.I.
Weinstein, who treated localized time-periodic perturbations of a particular
form. In the present work, new analytical issues need to be addressed in view
of (i) the presence of infinitely many frequencies which may resonate with the
continuum as well as (ii) the possible accumulation of such resonances in the
continuous spectrum. The theory is applied to a general class of Schr\""odinger
operators.

exhibit very many types of routes to chaos via strange nonchaotic attractors
(SNAs) with reference to a two-parameter $(A-f)$ space. The routes include
transitions to chaos via SNAs from both one frequency torus and period doubled
torus. In the former case, we identify the fractalization and type I
intermittency routes. In the latter case, we point out that atleast four
distinct routes through which the truncation of torus doubling bifurcation and
the birth of SNAs take place in this model. In particular, the formation of
SNAs through Heagy-Hammel, fractalization and type--III intermittent mechanisms
are described. In addition, it has been found that in this system there are
some regions in the parameter space where a novel dynamics involving a sudden
expansion of the attractor which tames the growth of period-doubling
bifurcation takes place, giving birth to SNA. The SNAs created through
different mechanisms are characterized by the behaviour of the Lyapunov
exponents and their variance, by the estimation of phase sensitivity exponent
as well as through the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents.

intermittency) as well as through a quasiperiodic subharmonic bifurcation
(Type-III intermittency). The intermittent attractors are characterized via a
number of Lyapunov measures including the behavior of the largest nontrivial
Lyapunov exponent and its variance as well as through distributions of
finite-time Lyapunov exponents. These attractors are ubiquitous in
quasiperiodically driven systems; the regions of occurrence of various SNAs are
identified in a phase diagram of the Duffing system.
