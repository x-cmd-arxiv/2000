wavelength range from $\sim 3200 - 8000$ \AA and follows the nebular
evolutionary phase of the ejecta. We have modeled the integrated fluxes by
means of the photoionization code CLOUDY. The models were run at a {\it fixed}
abundance value for the most prominent elements (i.e. H, He, C, O, N, Ne, Fe,
etc) over the entire time sequence. It is possible to constrain from this
simple model some of the physical conditions of the gaseous emitting region,
like temperature and density. Compared with previous studies of the gas
abundances of the heavy elements, we found that smaller enhancements of S, N
and Ar, and comparable values for O and Fe, are able to reproduce the
observations. The time evolution of the surface temperature of the ionizing
source and the high-ionization iron lines [Fe VII] 6087 \AA and [Fe X] 6374
\AA, is similar to what it is observed in the soft X-rays. The early line
profiles can be reproduced using a simple kinematical model consisting of an
equatorial ring and polar caps, expanding at a velocity of $\sim 1100$ km/s.
This simple model also approximates the structure of the resolved shell
observed by HST. Considering the complicated structure of the shell, the lack
of well defined values of its gas density and our limited knowledge of the time
evolution of the surface temperature of the photoionization source, the
comparison between models and observations agrees remarkably well.

ingredient in previous theoretical studies is the inclusion of dynamically
important levels of magnetic fields. As a minimal model for a candidate
presursor to the formation of binary and multiple stars, we therefore formulate
and solve the problem of the equilibria of isopedically magnetized, singular
isothermal disks, without the assumption of axial symmetry. Considerable
analytical progress can be made if we restrict our attention to models that are
scale-free, i.e., that have surface densities that vary inversely with distance
from the rotation axis of the system. In agreement with earlier analysis by
Syer and Tremaine, we find that lopsided (M=1) configurations exist at any
dimensionless rotation rate, including zero. Multiple-lobed (M = 2, 3, 4, ...)
configurations bifurcate from an underlying axisymmetric sequence at
progressively higher dimensionless rates of rotation, but such nonaxisymmetric
sequences always terminate in shockwaves before they have a chance to fission
into M=2, 3, 4, ... separate bodies. On the basis of our experience in this
paper, and the preceding Paper I, we advance the hypothesis that binary and
multiple star-formation from smooth (i.e., not highly turbulent) starting
states that are supercritical but in unstable mechanical balance requires the
rapid (i.e., dynamical) loss of magnetic flux at some stage of the ensuing
gravitational collapse.

contrasting spectroscopic and kinematic properties. Those with detectable
spectral lines from a cooler companion invariably have periods longer than a
year, while very short period sdB's have essentially invisible companions. We
derive typical orbital separations for the components of the composite spectrum
sdB's from their velocities. The current systems must have been produced by
Roche lobe overflow/mass transfer from low mass, metal-rich giants near the
first red giant branch tip, without undergoing common envelope envolution. The
same process should also occur at slightly lower red giant luminosities,
producing a wide binary with a helium white dwarf instead of an sdB star. Most
short period sdB's probably result from a common envelope following Roche lobe
overflow of the initial secondary onto the white dwarf. Rare post-common
envelope sdB + main sequence (MS) binaries also exist, but available data
suggest that most such systems involving lower MS companions end up merging.
The small and nearly identical masses of the two known MS survivors in short
period sdB binaries imply that both components must have lost a large fraction
of their initial mass in the common envelope process.

ranging from 0.015 pc to 20 pc to simulations of supersonic hydrodynamic and
MHD turbulence computed with the ZEUS MHD code. We use several different
statistical methods to compare models and observations. The Delta-variance
wavelet transform is most sensitive to characteristic scales and scaling laws,
but is limited by a lack of intensity weighting. The scanning-beam
size-linewidth relation is more robust with respect to noisy data. Obtaining
the global velocity scaling behaviour requires that large-scale trends in the
maps not be removed but treated as part of the turbulent cascade. We compare
the true velocity PDF in our models to velocity centroids and average line
profiles in optically thin lines, and find that the line profiles reflect the
true PDF better unless the map size is comparable to the total line-of-sight
thickness of the cloud. Comparison of line profiles to velocity centroid PDFs
can thus be used to measure the line-of-sight depth of a cloud. The observed
density and velocity structure is consistent with supersonic turbulence with a
driving scale at or above the size of the molecular cloud and dissipative
processes below 0.05 pc. Ambipolar diffusion could explain the dissipation. The
velocity PDFs exclude small-scale driving such as that from stellar outflows as
a dominant process in the observed region. In the models, large-scale driving
is the only process that produces deviations from a Gaussian PDF shape
consistent with observations. Strong magnetic fields impose a clear anisotropy
on the velocity field, reducing the velocity variance in directions
perpendicular to the field. (abridged)

The correlation length of flux-limited samples of LBGs depends on their
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity at lambda ~1700 Angstrom, with fainter
galaxies being less strongly clustered in space. It decreases by a factor ~3
over the range of limiting magnitudes that we have probed, namely 25<R<27,
suggesting that fainter samples include galaxies with smaller mass. We find
that: 1) the clustering strength of LBGs follows, within the errors, the same
scaling law with the volume density predicted for cold dark matter (CDM) halos;
2) the scaling law predicted for the galaxies using the halos mass spectrum and
a number of models for the relationship that maps the halos' mass into the
galaxies' UV luminosity depends only on how tightly mass and UV luminosity
correlate, but is otherwise insensitive to the details of the models. These
results provide additional evidence that the strong spatial clustering of LBGs
is due to galaxy biasing, supporting biased galaxy formation and gravitational
instability as the primary mechanism for the formation of structure. We also
find that 1) a scale invariant relationship between mass and UV luminosity
(e.g. a power law) is not supported, suggesting that the properties of star
formation of galaxies change along the mass spectrum of the observed LBGs; 2)
the scatter of the UV luminosity of LBGs of given mass must be relatively small
for massive LBGs, suggesting that the mass is an important parameter in
regulating the activity of star formation in these systems, and that the
fraction of massive halos at z~3 that are not observed in UV-selected surveys
is not large.

medium (ICM) of nearby clusters is non-gravitationally heated, we study the
effect of the non-gravitational heating on the ram-pressure stripping. For a
given redshift, we find that ram-pressure stripping has more influence on
galaxies in more massive clusters. On the other hand, for a given mass, it has
more influence on galaxies in the clusters at higher redshifts. In particular,
we predict that in rich clusters at z ~> 1, most of the galaxies are affected
by the ram-pressure stripping. While the non-gravitational heating
significantly reduces the influence of ram-pressure stripping on galaxies in
clusters with mass smaller than 1-5 10^13 M_sun, it does not affect the
influence in richer clusters. If the ICM is heated non-gravitationally at z>>1,
ram-pressure stripping does not occur at z ~ 1-2 in the progenitors of clusters
observed at 0 ~< z ~< 0.5, because the heat makes the ICM fraction of the
cluster progenitors small. On the other hand, if the ICM is heated

outside the cores of NGC6205, NGC6352 and NGC6388. More accurate positions are
determined for the X-ray sources in some ten clusters. The improved position
for the source in NGC6341 excludes the suggested ultraviolet counterpart. It is
shown that one of the two sources reported near the core NGC6626 is spurious,
as is the detection of a pulsar period in the PSPC data of this cluster; the
central source is resolved in three sources. One source reported previously in
NGC6304 is demoted to an upper limit. For 20 cluster cores better upper limits
to the X-ray luminosity are obtained.
  From a statistical analysis I argue that several sources outside the cluster
cores may well belong to the clusters. All spectral energy distributions
observed so far are relatively soft, with bremsstrahlung temperatures =~0.9keV;
there is evidence however that bremsstrahlung spectra do not correctly describe
the spectra. The X-ray luminosity per unit mass for the cluster as a whole does
not depend on the concentration; the luminosity per unit mass for the core may
increase with the cluster concentration.

problems is investigated. 3-SAT is a representative example of hard
computational tasks; it consists in knowing whether a set of alpha N randomly
drawn logical constraints involving N Boolean variables can be satisfied
altogether or not. Widely used solving procedures, as the
Davis-Putnam-Loveland-Logeman (DPLL) algorithm, perform a systematic search for
a solution, through a sequence of trials and errors represented by a search
tree. In the present study, we identify, using theory and numerical
experiments, easy (size of the search tree scaling polynomially with N) and
hard (exponential scaling) regimes as a function of the ratio alpha of
constraints per variable. The typical complexity is explicitly calculated in
the different regimes, in very good agreement with numerical simulations. Our
theoretical approach is based on the analysis of the growth of the branches in
the search tree under the operation of DPLL. On each branch, the initial 3-SAT
problem is dynamically turned into a more generic 2+p-SAT problem, where p and
1-p are the fractions of constraints involving three and two variables
respectively. The growth of each branch is monitored by the dynamical evolution
of alpha and p and is represented by a trajectory in the static phase diagram
of the random 2+p-SAT problem. Depending on whether or not the trajectories
cross the boundary between phases, single branches or full trees are generated
by DPLL, resulting in easy or hard resolutions.

debugging techniques to compare serial and parallel executions in order to show
where the computations begin to differ. If the original serial code is correct,
errors due to parallelization will be isolated by the comparison.
  One of the primary goals of the system is to minimize the effort required of
the user. To that end, the debugging system uses information produced by the
parallelization tool to drive the comparison process. In particular, the
debugging system relies on the parallelization tool to provide information
about where variables may have been modified and how arrays are distributed
across multiple processes. User effort is also reduced through the use of
dynamic instrumentation. This allows us to modify the program execution without
changing the way the user builds the executable.
  The use of dynamic instrumentation also permits us to compare the executions
in a fine-grained fashion and only involve the debugger when a difference has
been detected. This reduces the overhead of executing instrumentation.

the truly nonperturbative vacuum energy density which is one of the most
important characteristics of the QCD true ground state. It was directly applied
to the numerical evaluation of the chiral QCD vacuum topological structure

agreement with phenomenological and experimental values of the above-mentioned

derived an absolute lower bounds for the pion decay constant and the mass of
the $\eta'$ meson in the chiral limit. By introducing the most general

by constructing an axial gauge formulation in auxiliary coordinates:
$x^+=x^0\sin{\theta}+x^1\cos{\theta}, x^-=x^0\cos{\theta}-x^1\sin{\theta}$. For
\theta less than \pi\over 4 we can take $x^-$ as the evolution parameter and
construct a traditional canonical formulation of the temporal gauge Schwinger
model in which residual gauge fields dependent only on $x^+$ are static
canonical variables. Then we extrapolate the temporal gauge operator solution
into the axial region, \theta > \pi \over 4, where $x^+$ is taken as the
evolution parameter. In the axial region we find that we have to change
representations of the residual gauge fields from one realizing the PV
prescription to one realizing the ML prescription in order for the infrared
divergences resulting from $({\partial}_-)^{-1}$ to be canceled by
corresponding ones resulting from the inverse of the hyperbolic Laplace
operator. Finally, by taking the limit ${\theta}\to\frac{\pi}{2}-0$ we obtain
an operator solution and the Hamiltonian of the axial gauge (Coulomb gauge
)Schwinger model in ordinary coordinates. That solution includes auxiliary
fields and the representation space is of indefinite metric, providing further
evidence that ``physical'' gauges are no more physical than ``unphysical''
gauges.

theory is expressed as a functional integral over fields in 5 dimensions with a
fictitious 5th time. This is advantageous, in particular for gauge theories,
because it allows a different type of gauge fixing that avoids the Gribov
problem. Traditionally, in this approach, the fictitious 5th time is the analog
of computer time in a Monte Carlo simulation of 4-dimensional Euclidean fields.
A Euclidean probability distribution which depends on the 5th time relaxes to
an equilibrium distribution. However a broader framework, which we call ``bulk
quantization"", is required for extension to fermions, and for the increased
power afforded by the higher symmetry of the 5-dimensional action that is
topological when expressed in terms of auxiliary fields. Within the broader
framework, we give a direct proof by means of Schwinger-Dyson equations that a
time-slice of the 5-dimensional theory is equivalent to the usual 4-dimensional
theory. The proof does not rely on the conjecture that the relevant stochastic
process relaxes to an equilibrium distribution. Rather, it depends on the
higher symmetry of the 5-dimensional action which includes a BRST-type
topological invariance, and invariance under translation and inversion in the
5-th time. We express the physical S-matrix directly in terms of the truncated
5-dimensional correlation functions, for which ``going off the mass-shell''
means going from the 3 physical degrees of freedom to 5 independent variables.
We derive the Landau-Cutokosky rules of the 5-dimensional theory which include
the physical unitarity relation.

  Theorems for Most Probable Flows","37 pages, and 4 figures",,,,"math-ph math.AP math.MP",,"  Statistical equilibrium models of coherent structures in two-dimensional and
barotropic quasi-geostrophic turbulence are formulated using canonical and
microcanonical ensembles, and the equivalence or nonequivalence of ensembles is
investigated for these models. The main results show that models in which the
global invariants are treated microcanonically give richer families of
equilibria than models in which they are treated canonically. Such global
invariants are those conserved quantities for ideal dynamics which depend on
the large scales of the motion; they include the total energy and circulation.
For each model a variational principle that characterizes its equilibrium
states is derived by invoking large deviations techniques to evaluate the
continuum limit of the probabilistic lattice model. An analysis of the two
different variational principles resulting from the canonical and
microcanonical ensembles reveals that their equilibrium states coincide only
when the microcanonical entropy function is concave. These variational
principles also furnish Lyapunov functionals from which the nonlinear stability
of the mean flows can be deduced. While in the canonical model the well-known
Arnold stability theorems are reproduced, in the microcanonical model more
refined theorems are obtained which extend known stability criteria when the
microcanonical and canonical ensembles are not equivalent. A numerical example

that arise from the coarse-graining of a random field. Coarse-grained processes
of this kind form the basis of the analysis of local mean-field models in
statistical mechanics by exploiting the long-range nature of the interaction
function defining such models. In particular, the large deviation principle is
used in a companion paper to derive the variational principles that
characterize equilibrium macrostates in statistical models of two-dimensional
and quasi-geostrophic turbulence. Such macrostates correspond to large-scale,
long-lived flow structures, the description of which is the goal of the
statistical equilibrium theory of turbulence. The large deviation bounds for
the coarse-grained process under consideration are shown to hold with respect
to the strong $L^2$ topology, while the associated rate function is proved to
have compact level sets with respect to the weak topology. This compactness
property is nevertheless sufficient to establish the existence of equilibrium
macrostates for both the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

Here $J,B,{cal H}$ are $n\times n$ matrix valued functions and the Hamiltonian
${\cal H}\ge 0$ may be singular even everywhere. We obtain two results for such
a system to have minimal numbers ${\cal N}_\pm(\mathbb{R})=0$ (resp. ${\cal
N}_\pm(\mathbb{R}_\pm)=n$) and a criterion for their maximality ${\cal
N}_{\pm}(\mathbb{R}_+)=2n.$ Some conditions for a canonical system to have
intermediate numbers ${\cal N}_\pm(\mathbb{R}_+)$ are presented, too. We also
obtain a generalization of the well-known Titchmarsh-Sears theorem for second
order Sturm-Liouville type equations. This contains results due to Lidskii and
Krein as special cases.
  It is important to note that in general the above system does not give rise
to an operator but rather to a symmetric linear relation in a Hilbert space.

results of a paper by Kogan and Rofe-Beketov (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinb. 74

  We confirmed that the open electrode structure results in a distorted
horizontal pixel boundary. The open electrode region generates both single
pixel events and vertically split events, but no horizontally split events.
Because the single pixel events usually show the best energy resolution, we
discuss a method of increasing the fraction of single pixel events from the

the electrodes and dead-layers by comparing spectra from the open electrode
region with those from the other regions: electrodes, electrode finger and

  G.Naber (Coral Press, 2001) pp. 294-312",,,"quant-ph",,"  The problem of diagonalization of Hamiltonians of N-dimensional boson systems
by means of time-dependent canonical transformations (CT) is considered, the
case of quadratic Hamiltonians being treated in greater detail. The unitary
generator of time-dependent CT which can transform any Hamiltonian to that of a
system of uncoupled stationary oscillators is constructed. The close
relationship between methods of canonical transformations, time-dependent
integrals of motion and dynamical symmetry is noted.
  The diagonalization and symplectic properties of the uncertainty matrix for
2N canonical observables are studied. It is shown that the normalized
uncertainty matrix is symplectic for the squeezed multimode Glauber coherent
states and for the squeezed Fock states with equal photon numbers in each mode.
The Robertson uncertainty relation for the dispersion matrix of canonical
observables is shown to be minimized in squeezed coherent states only.

can later be decoded by means of a quantum measurement. We study the optimal

product states of $N$-spins are available. We obtain the asymptotic behaviour
of the average fidelity which provides a proof that the optimal states must be
entangled. We also give a prescription for constructing finite measurements for
general encoding eigenstates.

analysis is made for a 2-qubit system by using the error matrix method. It is
found that the state tomography method determines well the parameters that are
necessary for reconstructing the density matrix in NMR quantum computations.
Analysis is also made for a simplified state tomography procedure that uses
fewer read-outs. The result of this analysis with the error matrix method
demonstrates that a satisfactory accuracy in density matrix reconstruction can
be achieved even in a measurement with the number of read-outs being largely
reduced.
