Klypin, Kravstov, Bullock, & Primack model (KKBP). A maximum likelihood
parametric method is developed and applied to simulated images of background
galaxies (z=2.0) lensed by clusters at z=0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. The images have
field size (~10 arcmin) and angular resolution (~0.5 arcsec) characteristic of
the new generation of 8-10 meter-class ground-based telescopes. The method
recovers the correct virial mass of the DM halo, M_{200}, to within ~10% at all
redshifts. The recovered values of \delta_c and r_s are only accurate to ~25%;
however, their correlated errors are such that greater accuracy is obtained for
the mass. Clusters with an SIS density profile are recognized by the method,
while NFW and KKBP clusters are recognized as not being SIS. The method does
not discriminate between NFW and KKBP profiles for clusters of a given mass,
because they are too similar in their outer regions. Strongly lensed arcs near
the cluster centers would be needed to distinguish NFW from KKBP.

force acting on the binary is less than that acting on a point particle due to
randomization of the trajectories of field stars that pass near the binary.
Both effects tend to increase the random motion of a binary compared with that
of a point mass. If the maximum effective impact parameter for gravitational
encounters is comparable to the radius of gravitational influence of the

that of a single particle. This condition is probably fulfilled in the case of

several GeV, the gamma-ray spectra of old pulsars having lower surface fields
may extend to 50 GeV. Although the gamma-ray emission of older pulsars is
weaker, detecting pulsed emission at high energies from nearby sources would be
an important confirmation of polar cap models. Outer gap models predict more
gradual high-energy turnovers at around 10 GeV, but also predict an inverse
Compton component extending to TeV energies. Detection of pulsed TeV emission,
which would not survive attenuation at the polar caps, is thus an important

aperiodic variability of Galactic X-ray binaries are based Comptonization of
soft seed photons in a hot corona, where small-scale flares are induced by
flares of the soft seed photon input (presumably from a cold accretion disc).
However, in their original version, these models have neglected the additional
cooling of the coronal plasma due to the increased soft seed photon input, and
assumed a static coronal temperature structure. In this paper, our
Monte-Carlo/Fokker-Planck code for time-dependent radiation transfer and
electron energetics is used to simulate the self-consistent coronal response to
the various flaring scenarios that have been suggested to explain phase and
time lags observed in some Galactic X-ray binaries. It is found that the
predictions of models involving slab-coronal geometries are drastically
different from those deduced under the assumption of a static corona. However,
with the inclusion of coronal cooling they may even be more successful than in
their original version in explaining some of the observed phase and time lag
features. The predictions of the model of inward-drifting density perturbations
in an ADAF-like, two-temperature flow also differ from the static-corona case
previously investigated, but may be consistent with the alternating phase lags
seen in GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564. Models based on flares of a cool disc
around a hot, inner two-temperature flow may be ruled out for most objects
where significant Fourier-frequency-dependent phase and time lags have been
observed.

brightness of the night sky for the stellar mass density and average
metallicity of the universe today, and of the possible contribution of MACHO
progenitors and QSOs to the EBL. Assuming a Salpeter initial mass function with
a cutoff below 0.6 M_sun, a lower limit of Omega_{g+s}h^2>0.0015 I_{60} can be
derived to the visible (recycled gas + stars) mass density required to generate
an EBL at a level of I_{EBL}=60 I_{60} nW/m^2/sr: our latest, best-guess
estimate is Omega_{g+s}h^2 ~ 0.0023 I_{60}, which implies a mean metallicity at
the present-epoch of y_Z Omega_{g+s}/Omega_b ~ 0.2 Z_sun. If massive dark halos
around spiral galaxies are partially composed of faint, old white dwarfs, i.e.
if a non-negligible fraction (a few percent) of the nucleosynthetic baryons is
locked in the remnants (MACHOs) of intermediate-mass stars forming at very high
redshifts, then the bright early phases of such halos should contribute
significantly to the observed EBL. Assuming a standard black hole accretion

population and new synthesis models for the cosmic X-ray background, we
estimate a present mass density of QSO remnants of rho_{BH} ~ 3e5 M_sun/Mpc^3

adiabatic expansion is converted to the bulk kinetic energy of the outflow,
permitting the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the blast wave to
be self-consistently calculated. The behavior of the system is shown to
reproduce the hydrodynamic self-similar solutions in the relativistic and
nonrelativistic limits, and the formalism is applicable to scenarios that are
intermediate between the adiabatic and fully radiative regimes. Nonthermal
particle energization through stochastic gyroresonant acceleration with
magnetic turbulence in the blast wave is treated by employing energy-gain rates
and diffusive escape timescales based upon expressions derived in the
quasilinear regime. If the magnetic field in the shocked fluid approaches its
equipartition value, this process can accelerate escaping particles to
>~10^{20} eV energies, consistent with the hypothesis that ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) are accelerated by GRB blast waves. Due to particle
trapping by the magnetic turbulence, only the highest energy particles can
escape during the prompt and afterglow phases of a GRB for acceleration by a
Kolmogorov spectrum of MHD turbulence. Lower energy particles begin to escape
as the blast wave becomes nonrelativistic and shock Fermi acceleration becomes
more important.

coincident, the Fe K emission clearly peaks at a smaller radius, indicating a
higher temperature toward the reverse shock. This is qualitatively the profile
expected when the reverse shock, after travelling through the outer power-law

Brighter and harder continuum regions are observed with a rough bipolar

southeastern knots supports spatial variations of the relative abundance of
silicon and iron, which implies an incomplete mixing of the silicon and iron
layers.

does the lattice constant mismatch between bulk Si and bulk Ge manifests itself
in the alloy system? and (ii) what are the relevant strain release mechanisms?
To provide answers to these questions, we have carried out an in-depth study of
the changes in the local geometric and electronic structures arising from the
strain relaxation in Si_{1-x} Ge_{x} alloys using an ab initio molecular
dynamics scheme. The optimized lattice constant, while exhibiting a general
trend of linear dependence on the composition (Vegard's law), shows a negative
deviation from Vegard's law in the vicinity of x=0.5. We delineate the
mechanisms responsible for each one of the above features. We show that the
radial-strain relaxation through bond stretching is responsible for the overall
trend of linear dependence of the lattice constant on the composition. On the
other hand, the negative deviation from Vegard's law is shown to arise from the
angular-strain relaxation.

two analytical approximation schemes that capture most of the features of the

determined in two ways: by imposing the usual conditions of thermodynamic
equilibrium and by using the condition of marginal stability. In both cases,
the phase diagram consists of two qualitatively different regions. If the
transition temperature is higher than a critical value $T^{\star}$, quantum
effects are qualitatively irrelevant and the phase transition is {\it second}
order, as in the classical case. However, when quantum fluctuations depress the
transition temperature below $T^{\star}$, the transition becomes {\it first
order}. The susceptibility is discontinuous and shows hysteresis across the
first order line, a behavior reminiscent of that observed in the dipolar Ising
spin-glass LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$ in an external transverse magnetic field. We
discuss in detail the thermodynamics and the stationary dynamics of both
states. The spectrum of magnetic excitations of the equilibrium spin-glass
state is gaped, leading to an exponentially small specific heat at low
temperatures. That of the marginally stable state is gapless and its specific
heat varies linearly with temperature, as generally observed in glasses at low
temperature. We show that the properties of the marginally stable state are
closely related to those obtained in studies of the real-time dynamics of the

technique which, given a non-well-moded/typed program, diagnoses the
``reasons'' of inconsistency by finding minimal inconsistent subsets of
mode/type constraints. Since each constraint keeps track of the symbol
occurrence in the program, a minimal subset also tells possible sources of
program errors. Kima realizes automated correction by replacing symbol
occurrences around the possible sources and recalculating modes and types of
the rewritten programs systematically. As long as bugs are near-misses, Kima
proposes a rather small number of alternatives that include an intended

the LD-tree constructed for the program and a given query. A general property
of mappings from a certain subset of the branches of an infinite LD-tree into a
finite set is proved. From this result several termination theorems are
derived, by using different finite sets. The first two are formulated for the
predicate dependency and atom dependency graphs. Then a general result for the
case of the query-mapping pairs relevant to a program is proved (cf.
\cite{Sagiv,Lindenstrauss:Sagiv}). The correctness of the {\em TermiLog} system
described in \cite{Lindenstrauss:Sagiv:Serebrenik} follows from it. In this
system it is not possible to prove termination for programs involving
arithmetic predicates, since the usual order for the integers is not
well-founded. A new method, which can be easily incorporated in {\em TermiLog}
or similar systems, is presented, which makes it possible to prove termination
for programs involving arithmetic predicates. It is based on combining a finite
abstraction of the integers with the technique of the query-mapping pairs, and
is essentially capable of dividing a termination proof into several cases, such
that a simple termination function suffices for each case. Finally several
possible extensions are outlined.

large mixing angles have lower best-fit values for $\Ee$ than small-mixing

the SMA case lower than those found in simulations. This apparent conflict has
been interpreted as evidence against the large mixing oscillation solutions to
the solar neutrino problem. In order to quantify the degree to which the
experimental data favour the SMA over the large mixing solutions we use their
likelihood ratios as well as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We find within the
range of SN parameters predicted by simulations regions in which the LMA-MSW
solution is either only marginally disfavoured or favoured compared to the
SMA-MSW solution. We conclude therefore that the LMA-MSW solution is not in
conflict with the current understanding of SN physics. In contrast, the vacuum
oscillation and the LOW solutions to the solar neutrino problem can be excluded
at the $4\sigma$ level for most of the SN parameter ranges found in

the RHIC data for semicentral collisions up to transverse momenta of 1-1.5
GeV/c, but it considerably overestimates the measured elliptic flow at SPS
energies. The low density limit LDL is inconsistent with the measured magnitude
of v_2 at RHIC energies and with the shape of its p_t-dependence at both RHIC
and SPS energies. The success of the hydrodynamic model points to very rapid
thermalization in Au+Au collisions at RHIC and provides a serious challenge for
kinetic approaches based on classical scattering of on-shell particles.

effective theory is based on perturbations about this limit; a power counting
scheme is developed in which the small parameter is lambda^{1/2} where lambda ~

derive the effective Hamiltonian for strong interactions at next-to-leading

instead occupied by a few percent. Jastrow correlations lower the spectroscopic

theory on a spacetime cylinder, from the point of view of coherent states, or
equivalently, the Segal-Bargmann transform. Before gauge symmetry is imposed,
the coherent states are simply ordinary coherent states labeled by points in an
infinite-dimensional linear phase space. Gauge symmetry is imposed by
projecting the original coherent states onto the gauge-invariant subspace,
using a suitable regularization procedure. We obtain in this way a new family
of ""reduced"" coherent states labeled by points in the reduced phase space,
which in this case is simply the cotangent bundle of the structure group K.
  The main result explained here, obtained originally in a joint work of the
author with B. Driver, is this: The reduced coherent states are precisely those
associated to the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform for K, as introduced by
the author from a different point of view. This result agrees with that of K.
Wren, who uses a different method of implementing the gauge symmetry. The
coherent states also provide a rigorous way of making sense out of the quantum
Hamiltonian for the unreduced system.
  Various related issues are discussed, including the complex structure on the
reduced phase space and the question of whether quantization commutes with
reduction.

such schemes can be secure against eavesdropping attacks in the abstract spin
space but could be insecure in the real three-dimensional space. We discuss an
approach to the security of quantum key distribution in space by using Bell's
inequality and a special preparation of the space part of the wave function.

Lett. 86 (17) (2001)3907-3910.","10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3907",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a general technique to implement products of many qubit operators
communicating via a joint harmonic oscillator degree of freedom in a quantum
computer. By conditional displacements and rotations we can implement
Hamiltonians which are trigonometric functions of qubit operators. With such
operators we can effectively implement higher order gates such as Toffoli gates
and C^n-NOT gates, and we show that the entire Grover search algorithm can be
implemented in a direct way.

This scheme is efficient in that it uses all EPR pairs in distributing the key

because each EPR pair carries 2 bits of key code.

  Rev. A. We now take into account the finite lifetime of the cavity and
  limited efficiencies to detect the energy of the meter atoms",,,,"quant-ph",,"  An experiment is proposed to visualize stroboscopically in real time the
dynamics of a photon oscillating between two cavities. The visualization is
implemented by a sequence of weak measurements (POVM), which are carried out by
probing one of the cavities with a Rydberg atom and detecting a resulting phase
shift by Ramsey interferometry. This way to measure the number of photons in a
cavity was experimentally realized by Brune et al.. We suggest a feedback
mechanism which minimizes the disturbance due to the measurement and enables a
detection of the original evolution of the radiation field. PACS numbers:
