features of both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust grains. The IR spectra were
combined with photometric data ranging from the UV through the optical into the
sub-mm region. We defined two key groups, based upon the spectral shape of the
infrared region. The derived results can be summarized as follows: (1) the
continuum of the IR to sub-mm region of all stars can be reconstructed by the
sum of a power-law and a cool component, which can be represented by a black
body. Possible locations for these components are an optically thick,
geometrically thin disc (power-law component) and an optically thin flared
region (black body); (2) all stars have a substantial amount of cold dust
around them, independent of the amount of mid-IR excess they show; (3) also the
near-IR excess is unrelated to the mid-IR excess, indicating different
composition/location of the emitting material; (4) remarkably, some sources
lack the silicate bands; (5) apart from amorphous silicates, we find evidence
for crystalline silicates in several stars, some of which are new detections;
(6) PAH bands are present in at least 50% of our sample, and their appearance
is slightly different from PAHs in the ISM; (7) PAH bands are, with one
exception, not present in sources which only show a power-law continuum in the
IR; their presence is unrelated to the presence of the silicate bands; (8) the
dust in HAEBE stars shows strong evidence for coagulation; this dust processing
is unrelated to any of the central star properties (such as age, spectral type
and activity).

Beginning ~1.5 days after the burst, the light-curves of this GRB steepen
measurably. The existence of such achromatic breaks are usually taken to be an
important observational signature that the ejecta are not expanding
isotropically, but rather have a collimated jet-like geometry. If we interpret
the data in this context, we derive an opening angle of 5 degrees, which
reduces the energy release compared to an isotropic model by a factor of ~275,
to 1.7 x 10^51 erg. To fit the data with a simple jet model requires extinction
along the line of sight. The derived A_V is in the range 0.11 - 0.82 mag,
depending on the adopted extinction law and whether the electrons giving rise
to the optical emission are undergoing synchrotron cooling or not. Since this
is in excess of the expected extinction from our Galaxy, we attribute this to
the GRB host. We note that this extinction is typical of a galactic disk, and
therefore the event likely took place in the disk of its host.

the epoch of thermal relaxation. After the supernova explosion, powerful
neutrino emission quickly cools the stellar core, while the crust stays hot.
The cooling wave then propagates through the crust, due to its finite thermal
conductivity. When the cooling wave reaches the surface (age 10-100 yr), the
effective temperature drops sharply from 250 eV to 30 or 100 eV, depending on
the cooling model. The crust relaxation time is sensitive to the (poorly known)
microscopic properties of matter of subnuclear density, such as the heat
capacity, thermal conductivity, and superfluidity of free neutrons. We
calculate the cooling models with the new values of the electron thermal
conductivity in the inner crust, based on a realistic treatment of the shapes
of atomic nuclei. Superfluid effects may shorten the relaxation time by a
factor of 4. The comparison of theoretical cooling curves with observations
provides a potentially powerful method of studying the properties of the

different signatures of substructure, including multiple peaks and broad but

there is a high probability of detecting the presence of tidal debris with a

probability is a few percent using just the velocities of 100 halo stars in a

tidal gravitational field of the MBH transforms the initial spherical clump
into a moderately thick gaseous disk (or torus) around the MBH. The developed
disk is also found to show rotation, essentially because the tidal field
changes efficiently the orbital angular momentum of the clump into intrinsic
angular momentum of the disk. Furthermore about a few percent of gas mass
(corresponding to a few $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$) in the clump is found to be
transferred to the central sub-parsec region around the MBH within an order of

not only be associated closely with the formation of nuclear disk around the

Galactic center black hole rotates with nearly maximal spin, and that the
magnetic field threading the horizon is in rough equipartition with matter
accreted by the hole, the spectra and total fluxes of accelerated CRs and their
associated curvature emission depend only on accretion rate. For the accretion
rate estimated on the basis of observations of stellar winds near Sgr A* ($\sim
10^{-3}$ Eddington), the maximum proton energy achievable by this mechanism is
of the order of $10^{18}$ eV, and the corresponding CR power is $\sim
10^{41}\alpha_{CR}$ erg s$^{-1}$, where $\alpha_{CR}<<1$ is the CR production
efficiency. The corresponding spectrum of curvature photons peaks at around a
hundred GeV, with a total luminosity comparable to the CR power released. For
much lower accretion rates both the CR and gamma-ray fluxes predicted are
completely insignificant. Upcoming gamma-ray experiments, such as CANGAROO,
HESS and GLAST, can be used to probe the parameters of this system.

tunneling microscopy with a two terminal non-magnetic tip. It is based upon the
spin asymmetry effect of the tunneling current between a ferromagnetic surface
and a two-terminal non-magnetic tip. The spin asymmetry effect is due to the
spin-orbit scattering in the tip. The effect can be viewed as a Mott scattering
of tunneling electrons within the tip. To obtain quantitative results we
perform numerical simulation within the single band tight binding model, using
recursive Green function method and Landauer-B\""uttiker formula for
conductance. A new model has been developed to take into account the spin-orbit
scattering off the impurities within the single-band tight-binding model. We
show that the spin-asymmetry effect is most prominent when the device is in
quasi-ballistic regime and the typical value of spin asymmetry is about 5%.

Tachyonic preheating is so efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes
within a single oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the
minimum of its effective potential. As an application of this theory we
consider preheating in the hybrid inflation scenario, including SUSY-motivated
F-term and D-term inflationary models. We show that preheating in hybrid
inflation is typically tachyonic and the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous
component of the scalar fields driving inflation ends after a single
oscillation. Our results may also be relevant for the theory of the formation

violating the so-called R-parity symmetry. Such couplings would lead to the
lepton and/or baryon number violation and modify deeply the phenomenology of
supersymmetry at future particle colliders. We have worked out tests of the
R-parity violating interactions. First, we have studied clear signals of the
single production of supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles,
which involves the R-parity violating interactions, in the context of physics
at next leptonic and hadronic colliders. The results show that strong
sensitivities could be obtained on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters
and indicate the possibility of an improvement of one to two order of magnitude
concerning the present indirect limits on the values of several R-parity
violating coupling constants. Besides, it has been verified that the single
superpartner production analysis offers the opportunity to reconstruct in a
model independent way some superpartner masses with an high accuracy. Secondly,
we have studied CP symmetry violation effects, due to the complex phases of
R-parity violating coupling constants, in the pair production of either
fermions or sfermions of different flavors at future leptonic colliders. We
have seen notably that the single top quark production allows to test the CP
violation in the hadronic sector. The main conclusion of these works is that
complex phases of certain R-parity violating coupling constants could be
observed, and in particular within a scenario where those couplings would
exhibit a strong hierarchy in flavor space.

than the gauge boson masses. Large double (DL) and single (SL) logarithmic
virtual electroweak Sudakov corrections lead to significant effects for
observable cross sections. Recently, leading and subleading universal
corrections for external fermions and transverse gauge boson lines were
resummed by employing the infrared evolution equation method. The results were
confirmed at the DL level by explicit two loop calculations with the physical
Standard Model (SM) fields. Also for longitudinal degrees of freedom the
approach was utilized for DL-corrections via the Goldstone boson equivalence
theorem. In all cases, the electroweak Sudakov logarithms exponentiate. In this
paper we extend the same approach to both Yukawa enhanced as well as subleading
Sudakov corrections to longitudinal gauge boson and Higgs production. We use
virtual contributions to splitting functions of the appropriate Goldstone
bosons in the high energy regime and find that all universal subleading terms
exponentiate. The approach is verified by employing a non-Abelian version of
Gribov's factorization theorem and by explicit comparison with existing one
loop calculations. As a side result, we obtain also all top-Yukawa enhanced
subleading logarithms for chiral fermion production at high energies to all
orders. In all cases, the size of the subleading contributions at the two loop
level is non-negligible in the context of precision measurements at future

a constant (or zero) in shell model calculations (designated as $<T=0>=0$) are
investigated. Despite the apparent severity of such a procedure, one gets
fairly reasonable spectra. We find that using $<T=0>=0$ in single j shell
calculations degeneracies appear e.g. the $I={1/2} ^{-}$ and ${13/2}^{-}$
states in $^{43}$Sc are at the same excitation energies; likewise the
I=$3_{2}^{+}$,$7_{2}^{+}$,9$^{+}_{1}$ and 10$^{+}_{1}$ states in $^{44}$Ti. The
above degeneracies involve the vanishing of certain 6j and 9j symbols. The
symmetry relations of Regge are used to explain why these vanishings are not
accidental. Thus for these states the actual deviation from degeneracy are good
indicators of the effects of the T=0 matrix elements. A further indicator of
the effects of the T=0 interaction in an even - even nucleus is to compare the
energies of states with odd angular momentum with those that are even.

that none of these approaches gives results close to what is obtained by using
the same interaction in the so-called instantaneous approximation, which is
often employed in non-relativistic calculations. However, a recently proposed
effective interaction was shown to account for the main features of both the
Bethe-Salpeter equation and the energy-dependent approach. In the present work,
a detailed comparison of these different methods for calculating binding
energies of a two-particle system is made. Some improvement, previously
incorporated for the zero-mass boson case in the derivation of the effective
interaction, is also employed for massive bosons. The constituent particles are
taken to be distinguishable and spinless. Different masses of the exchanged
boson (including a zero mass) as well as states with different angular momenta
are considered and the contribution of the crossed two-boson exchange diagram
is discussed. With this respect, the role played by the charge of the exchanged
boson is emphasized. It is shown that the main difference between the
Bethe-Salpeter results and the instantaneous approximation ones are not due to
relativity as often conjectured.

phase angle is thus restricted to be negative and close to 0 or $-\pi$ for

broken. The same framwork of the coherent mechanism can explain the symmetry
