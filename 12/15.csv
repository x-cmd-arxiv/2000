tracking the dynamical evolution of substructure within larger dark halos. The
scheme incorporates the effects of dynamical friction, tidal mass loss and
tidal heating via physically motivated approximations. Using our scheme, we can
predict the orbital evolution and mass-loss history of individual subhalos in
detail. We are also able to determine the impact and importance of the
different physical processes on the dynamical evolution of the subhalos. To
test and calibrate this model, we compare it with a set of recent
high-resolution numerical simulations of mergers between galaxies and small
companions. We find that we can reproduce the orbits and mass-loss rates seen
in all of these simulations with considerable accuracy, using a single set of
values for the three free parameters in our model. Computationally, our scheme
is more than 1000 times faster than the simplest of the high-resolution
numerical simulations. This means that we can carry out detailed and
statistically meaningful investigations into the characteristics of the subhalo
population in different cosmologies, the stripping and disruption of the
subhalos, and the interactions of the subhalos with other dynamical structures
such as a thin disk. This last point is of particular interest given the
ubiquity of minor mergers in hierarchical models. In this regard, our method's
simplicity and speed makes it particularly attractive for incorporation into
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

such an object violates a fundamental paradigm for radio loud AGN. In paper I,
we showed that this object was most likely a spiral host with optical line

resolution radio imaging, a radio/mm continuum spectrum for the nucleus, a
detection of HI absorption against the bright radio core, an upper-limit to CO

jet at 20cm extending 42 kpc into the southern lobe. At 3.6cm, we also detect a
nuclear jet similar in length to that in M87 but 10 times weaker. We believe
that this is the first detection of a radio jet on these scales in a disk or
spiral host galaxy. The nuclear radio spectrum is similar to many blazar or QSO
like objects, suggesting that the galaxy harbors an imbedded and obscured AGN.
We model a turnover in the spectrum at low frequencies as Free-Free absorption.
We detect very strong and narrow HI absorption with nearly the entire 20 cm
core continuum absorbed, implying an unusually large optical depth (tau~1). We
suggest that the nucleus is seen through a disk-like distribution of ISM gas,
possibly through a spiral arm or a warp to account for the high column density.

2 clumps of galaxies separated by 3300 km/s, which are imbedded in a nearly

measuring the widths of the O VI lines. We find significant absorption near the
center of the O VI 1032 line, with less absorption in O VI 1038. The absorption
equivalent widths imply an O VI column density greatly exceeding that of
interstellar O VI along the Cygnus Loop line of sight. We suggest that the
absorption may be due to resonant scattering by O VI ions within the shock

focus is to study the dependence of the lifetimes of the clusters on the number
of cluster stars and the chosen escape condition.
  We find that star clusters in external tidal fields exhibit a scaling problem
in the sense that their lifetimes do not scale with the relaxation time.
Isolated clusters show a similar problem if stars are removed only after their
distance to the cluster centre exceeds a certain cut-off radius. If stars are
removed immediately after their energy exceeds the energy necessary for escape,
the scaling problem disappears.
  We show that some stars which gain the energy necessary for escape are
scattered to lower energies before they can leave the cluster. Since the
efficiency of this process decreases with increasing particle number, it causes
the lifetimes not to scale with the relaxation time. Analytic formulae are
derived for the scaling of the lifetimes in the different cases.

sources are displacing the thermal gas leaving cavities filled with radio

scaling laws in a hierarchically clustering universe. Numerical simulations of
galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) dominated universes indicate that
the slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation are well
reproduced in this model, although not, as proposed in recent work, because of
the cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity, but
rather as a result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the
luminous component of the galaxy. The zero-point of the TF relation is
determined mainly by the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon_I$) as well as
by the concentration ($c$) of the dark halo. For $c \sim 10$, as is typical of
halos formed in the ``concordance'' $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that this
requires $\Upsilon_I \sim 1.5$, in reasonable agreement with the mass-to-light
ratios expected of stellar populations with colors similar to those of TF
galaxies. This conclusion supersedes that of Navarro & Steinmetz (2000a,b), who
claimed the $\Lambda$CDM halos were too concentrated to be consistent with the
observed TF relation. The disagreement can be traced to inconsistencies in the
normalization of the power spectrum used in that work. Our new results show
that simulated disk galaxies in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario are not clearly
inconsistent with the observed I-band Tully-Fisher relation. On the other
hand,their angular momenta is much lower than observed. Accounting
simultaneously for the spin, size and luminosity of disk galaxies remains a

photo-dissociation spheres around each luminous object. The maximum background
opacity of the IGM in the H_2 Lyman-Werner bands is \tau_{H_2} ~ 1-2 for a
relic molecular fraction x_{H_2}=2 x 10^{-6}, about 6 times greater than found
by Haiman, Abel & Rees. Therefore, the relic molecular hydrogen can decrease
the photo-dissociation rate by about an order of magnitude. The problem is
relevant to the formation of small primordial galaxies with masses M_{DM} <
10^8 M_\odot, that rely on molecular hydrogen cooling to collapse.
Alternatively, the universe may have remained dark for several hundred million
years after the birth of the first stars, until galaxies with virial
temperature T_{vir} > 10^4 K formed.

a powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic contributions to observed

disentangled statistically from the ellipticity correlations or computed
locally from circular integrals of the ellipticity field. This allows for an
unambiguous detection of intrinsic galaxy alignments in the data. When the
distortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, the

dependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. It is found
that dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations as
well as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. This
finding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk & White
(NFW), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra
substantially different from Cold Dark Matter (CDM). In particular, the
single-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo
mass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark
matter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the
concentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms
recent suggestions by Bullock et al., although this new modeling differs from
theirs in detail. These findings imply that observational limits on the
concentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter content
within individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of mass
fluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. The constraints on
$\Lambda$CDM models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the Milky
Way and by the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation are revisited, with the
result that neither dataset is clearly incompatible with the `concordance'
($\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$, $\sigma_8=0.9$) $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony. This
conclusion differs from that reached recently by Navarro & Steinmetz, a
disagreement that can be traced to inconsistencies in the normalization of the

The absence of X-ray absorption, and the radio/optical/X-ray colors, when
combined with previous radio evidence that the source is a foreshortened FRII,
suggest that the radio jets are seen at an angle to the line of sight of about
30 degrees, intermediate between the radio-galaxy and quasar classes. Roughly a
third of the soft X-ray emission is from a cluster atmosphere, for which we
measure a temperature of 1.9 (+1.3, -0.7) keV, making this the second

lie within the core radius of the cluster, for which the cooling time is
sufficiently long that there is no reason to expect the presence of a cooling
flow. The radio lobes of 3C 346 are roughly in pressure balance with the

behavior in thin polymer films. The simulations employ a version of the

competition between a stiffening of the polymers and their dense packing in the
melt. The melt is geometrically confined between two impenetrable walls
separated by distances ranging from once to about fifteen times the bulk radius
of gyration. The confinement influences static and dynamic properties of the
films: Chains close to the wall preferentially orient parallel to it. This
orientation tendency propagates through the film and leads to a layer structure
at low temperatures and small thicknesses. The layer structure strongly
suppresses out-of-plane reorientations of the chains. In-plane reorientations
have to take place in a high density environment which gives rise to an
increase of the corresponding relaxation times. However, local density
fluctuations are enhanced if film thickness and temperature decrease. This
implies a reduction of the glass transition temperature with decreasing film
thickness.

fluctuations are found to be dominated by rare events; all moments of truncated
correlations are computed. The response to a small field applied after waiting
time $t_w$, as measured in aging experiments, and the fluctuation-dissipation
ratio $X(t,t_w)$ are computed. For $(t-t_w) \sim t_w^{\hat{\alpha}}$,
$\hat{\alpha} <1$, it equals its equilibrium value X=1, though time
translational invariance fails. It exhibits for $t-t_w \sim t_w$ aging regime

introduce a generic iteration algorithm on partial orderings and prove its
correctness in an abstract setting. Then we instantiate this algorithm with
specific partial orderings and functions to obtain specific constraint
propagation algorithms.
  In particular, using the notions commutativity and semi-commutativity, we
show that the {\tt AC-3}, {\tt PC-2}, {\tt DAC} and {\tt DPC} algorithms for

transformation such that the resulting configuration variables describe the
dynamical properties of Kerr-Newman black holes in a natural manner. The
classical Hamiltonian written in terms of these variables and their conjugate
momenta is replaced by the corresponding self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator and
an eigenvalue equation for the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass of the hole,

very restricted sense, this eigenvalue equation may be viewed as a sort of
""Schr\""odinger equation of black holes"". Our ""Schr\""odinger equation"" implies
that the ADM mass, electric charge and angular momentum spectra of black holes
are discrete, and the mass spectrum is bounded from below. Moreover, the
spectrum of the quantity $M^2-Q^2-a^2$, where $a$ is the angular momentum per
unit mass of the hole, is strictly positive when an appropriate self-adjoint
extension is chosen. The WKB analysis yields the result that the large
eigenvalues of $M$, $Q$ and $a$ are of the form $\sqrt{2n}$, where $n$ is an
integer. It turns out that this result is closely related to Bekenstein's
proposal on the discrete horizon area spectrum of black holes.

integrated luminosity in the high energy peak. In the case of scenarios when
stoponium decays mainly into gluons the signal/background ratio is about 1/4.
The channel S->hh into two lightest Higgs bosons could be also seen with high
significance. Thus, several weeks run is sufficient for the stoponium
discovery, if its mass is approximately known (e.g. from observation of direct
stops production at LHC). Then, in MSSM scenarios with dominant S->hh decay PLC
shows excellent possibilities to discover bound state of stops, practically
immediately after beginning of operating.
  The e+e- option also has some prospects to observe stoponium but only in the
case of scenarios with dominant decay into two lightest Higgs bosons, with tens
of events per 100 $fb^{-1}$. Interesting possibility appears in the case when
the resonance is seated on 0.1% width luminosity peak - one could resolve the

hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem obey an inequality that
is satisfied in nature. This inequality implies that the cosmological constant
problem can be explained if the hierarchy problem is understood. The basic idea
generalizes to the multibrane world scenario. We discuss models with piecewise

Einstein equation), a key element of the scenario. We also discuss the global

two classes of solutions depending on the two possible realisations of the
outer-automorphism group of the toric graph $\Delta$(ADE). In F-theory on
elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds, we give explicit results for the affine non
simply laced toric data and the corresponding BCFG mirror geometries. The
latters extend known results obtained in litterature for the affine ADE cases.
We also study the geometric engineering of $ N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory
in eight dimensions. In type II superstring compactifications on local
Calabi-Yau threefolds, we complete the analysis for ordinary ADE singularities
by giving the explict derivation of the lacking non simply ones. Finally we
develop the basis of polyvalent toric geometry. The latter extends bivalent and
trivalent geometries, considered in the geometric engineering method, and use
it to derive a new solution for the affine $\hat D_4$ singularity. Other
features are also discussed.

show that the behavior of cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales in
the brane-world model is the same as that in the standard no-extradimension
model, irrespective of the initial condition for bulk perturbations, in the
late stage when the cosmic expansion rate $H$ is smaller than the inverse of
the bulk curvature scale $\ell$. Further, we give rough estimates which
indicate that in the early universe when $H$ is much larger than $1/\ell$,
perturbations in these two models behave quite differently, and the
conservation of the Bardeen parameter does not hold for superhorizon
perturbations in the brane-world model.

to radial position, whether there is a horizon or not. For time-dependent

the other hand it maps onto the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the knot
concordance group, via symmetric grope cobordism in 4-space. In particular, the

Based on the example of a sheet of nuclear matter of infinite lateral

confinement and generates restoring forces driving the system towards compact

systems. However, many aspects of the process of wire fragmentation still
remain unclear. If the current density is not too high, the wire may break up
in the solid state.
  In a series of papers, see references therein, Graneau argued that neither
mechanical vibrations induced by the electromagnetic pinch force nor thermal
expansion could have been responsible for the wire disintegration because they
were too weak. To explain the phenomenon he appealed to the obsolete Ampere
force law as opposed to the conventional Biot-Savart force law. Graneau argued
that the Ampere force law would lead to a longitudinal tension in the wire,
although his calculations may have been in error on this point. Therefore,
Graneau's explanations induced a controversy in electrodynamics with a number
of authors arguing pro and con.
  In this investigation, we use a simplified magneto-thermo-elastic model to
study flexural vibrations induced by high pulsed currents in wires with clumped
ends on account of their role in the disintegration process. It is shown that
the induced flexural vibrations are strong enough to lead to the breaking of
the wire in a wide range of parameters.

optimizing VMC wave functions, focusing on the ability to optimize parameters

  The kinds of problems that can be simulated with Monte Carlo methods are
expanded through the development of new algorithms for combining a QMC

tolerate noise. An improved correlated sampling method, the two-sided energy

within the three-step-model framework, correspond to a set of electron
trajectories for which tunneling ionization is strongly suppressed. Particular
features in the observed enhancement suggest that the high-frequency field
provides an additional mechanism for the electron to reach the continuum. This
interpretation is supported by a time-frequency analysis of the harmonic yield.

an advantage over schemes involving only bichromatic fields.

of both quantization and universality of Planck's constant remains mysterious,
as well as other ""peculiar"" properties of quantum dynamics. In this paper we
review a recent causal extension of quantum mechanics consistently explaining
all its ""mysteries"" by irreducibly complex, ""dynamically multivalued"" behaviour
of the underlying system of two interacting protofields (quant-ph/9902015,
quant-ph/9902016). The theory contains no imposed postulates or entities except
one, unavoidable assumption about the physical nature of the protofields. All
the observed entities and their properties, starting from physically real
space, time, and elementary particle structure, are consistently derived, in
exact correspondence with their emergence in real, irreducibly complex system
dynamics. The latter provides also natural (dynamic) unification of the
causally extended versions of quantum mechanics, relativity, and field theory,
including unification and causal understanding of particle interaction forces.
Realism and wholeness of the obtained world picture are in agreement with the
""absolute reality"" quest of Max Planck and confirm his famous doubts about the
conventional scheme of quantum mechanics (cf. quant-ph/9911107,

a characteristic length of the orbit is a better indicator. When these matters
are properly understood, the periodic-orbit theory for generic quantum systems
