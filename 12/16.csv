  Journal",,"10.1086/320240",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that magnetized, radiation dominated atmospheres can support steady
state patterns of density inhomogeneity that enable them to radiate at far
above the Eddington limit, without suffering mass loss. The inhomogeneities
consist of periodic shock fronts bounding narrow, high-density regions,
interspersed with much broader regions of low density. The radiation flux
avoids the regions of high density, which are therefore weighed down by
gravity, while gas in the low-density regions is slammed upward into the shock
fronts by radiation force. As the wave pattern moves through the atmosphere,
each parcel of matter alternately experiences upward and downward forces, which
balance on average. Magnetic tension shares the competing forces between
regions of different densities, preventing the atmosphere from blowing apart.
We calculate the density structure and phase speed of the wave pattern, and
relate these to the wavelength, the density contrast, and the factor by which
the net radiation flux exceeds the Eddington limit. In principle, this factor
can be as large as the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure, or the
ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure, whichever is smaller. Although the
magnetic pressure must be large compared to the mean gas pressure in order to
support a large density contrast, it need not be large compared to the
radiation pressure. These highly inhomogeneous flows could represent the
nonlinear development of the ""photon bubble"" instability discovered by Gammie.
We briefly discuss the applicability of these solutions to astrophysical
systems.

found that multiple encounter and merging can trigger repetitive massive
starbursts (typically $\sim$ 100 $M_{\odot}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$) owing to the
strong tidal disturbance and the resultant gaseous dissipation during merging.
The magnitude of the starburst is found to depend on initial virial ratio
(i.e., the ratio of total kinematical energy to total potential energy) such
that the maximum star formation rate is larger for the merger with smaller
virial ratio. Furthermore we found that the time interval between the epochs of
the triggered starbursts is longer for the merger with the larger virial ratio.
The remnant of a multiple galaxy merger with massive starbursts is found to
have metal-poor gaseous halo that is formed by tidal stripping during the
merging. We accordingly suggest that metal-poor gaseous halo in a field
elliptical galaxy is a fossil record of the past multiple merging events for
the galaxy.

-- some eigenmodes decay too slowly. For each degree l, there exists an
eigenmode which decays at the smallest rate. The amplitude of this eigenmode,
defined as relative perturbation of energy behind the shock front, is constant
at early time. Later, when the blast wave slows down to Gamma = l/10, an
oscillatory decay commences, and the amplitude drops to less than 10% of the

(1) Global colors and absolute magnitudes the during dusty starburst of a major
merger do not change with time significantly, because interstellar dust heavily
obscures young starburst populations that could cause rapid evolution of
photometric properties of the merger. (2) Dust extinction of stellar
populations in a galaxy merger with large infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$ $>$

populations are preferentially obscured by dust than old ones. This is because
younger populations are located in the central region where a larger amount of
dusty interstellar gas can be transferred from the outer gas-rich regions of
the merger. (3) Both $L_{\rm IR}$ and the ratio of $L_{\rm IR}$ to $B$ band

evolution of a prime candidate for producing this spectral signature: a dusty
starburst associated with a major galaxy merger. We show that as this system
evolves dynamically, its spectral type changes from and ``e(a)'' type
(exhibiting strong H$\delta$ absorption and modest [OII] emission -- the
identifying features of local dusty starburst galaxies) to a k+a type and then
finally to a passive ``k'' type. This result shows that galaxies with an e(a)

greatly controls the spectral evolution in these merger cases. Our simulations
also show that a merger with very high infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$ $>$

that spectral types can be correlated with infrared fluxes in dusty starburst

evolution of a merger between a central massive black hole with the mass of

the massive black hole and consequently forms a rotating nuclear thick stellar
disk. The orbit of each stellar component in the developed disk is rather
eccentric with the mean eccentricity of $\sim$ 0.5. These results imply that

detected and the best documented example, the HH~34 system, shows a systematic
velocity decrease with distance on either side of the source. In this paper, we
have modeled giant jets by performing fully three-dimensional simulations of
overdense, radiatively cooling jets modulated with long-period
  (P $\sim$ several hundred years) and large amplitude sinusoidal velocity
variability at injection ($\Delta v \sim$ mean jet flow velocity). Allowing
them to travel over a distance well beyond the source, we have found that
multiple travelling pulses develop and their velocity indeed falls off smoothly
and systematically with distance. This deceleration is fastest if the jet is
pressure-confined, in which case the falloff in velocity is roughly consistent
with the observations. The deceleration occurs as momentum is transferred by
gas expelled sideways from the traveling pulses. The simulation of a
pressure-confined, steady-state jet with similar initial conditions to those of
the pulsed jet shows that the flow in this case experiences $acceleration$.
This result is thus an additional indication that the primary source of
deceleration in the giant flows $cannot$ be attributed to braking of the jet
head against the external medium.

proteins from the sequences of their amino acids is one of the most important
challenges in molecular biology. An essential ingredient to solve this problem
within coarse-grained models is the task of deducing effective interaction
potentials between the amino acids. Over the years several techniques have been
developed to extract potentials that are able to discriminate satisfactorily
between the native and non-native folds of a pre-assigned protein sequence. In
general, when these potentials are used in actual dynamical folding
simulations, they lead to a drift of the native structure outside the
quasi-native basin. In this study, we present and validate an approach to
overcome this difficulty. By exploiting several numerical and analytical tools

an azo tracer molecule (methyl red) through a nematic liquid crystal (5CB).
This system was first investigated in an important study by Hara et al. (Japan.
J. Appl. Phys. 23, 1420 [1984]). Since that time, it has become clear that the
presence of complementary ground-state and photoproduct FRS gratings can result
in nonexponential profiles, and that complementary-grating effects are
significant even when ""minor"" deviations from exponential decay are observed.
We have investigated the methyl red/5CB system in order to evaluate the
possible effects of complementary gratings. In the isotropic phase, we find
that the presence of complementary gratings results in a nonmonotonic FRS
signal, which significantly changes the values inferred for the isotropic
diffusion coefficients. As a result, the previously reported discontinuity at
the nematic/isotropic transition temperature (TNI) is not present in the new
data. On the other hand, in the nematic phase, the new experiments largely
confirm the previous observations of single-exponential FRS decay and the
non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the nematic diffusion coefficients
close to TNI. Finally, we have also observed that the decrease in the diffusion
anisotropy with increasing temperature can be correlated with the 5CB nematic
order parameter S(T) over the full nematic temperature range.

attractive Hubard model which is an extension of previous work by Vilk and
Tremblay on the repulsive model. Exact results are derived in the general
context of functional derivative approaches to many-body theories. The first
step of the approximation is based on a local field type ansatz. All physical
quantities can be expressed as a function of double-occupancy (in addition to
temperature and filling). Double-occupancy is determined without adjustable
parameter by imposing the Pauli principle and a crucial sum-rule, making the
first step of the approximation Two-Particle Self-Consistent. The final
expression for the self-energy is obtained by calculating the low-frequency
part of the exact expression with the two-particle correlation, Green function
and renormalized vertex obtained in the first step of the approximation. The
Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically satisfied. Application
of this non-perturbative many-body approach to the intermediate coupling regime
shows quantitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Both
approaches predict the existence of a pseudogap in the single-particle spectral
weight. I present some physical properties, such as correlation lengths,
superfluid density, and characteristic pair fluctuation energy, to highlight
the origin of the pseudogap in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. These
results suggest that two-dimensional systems that are described by a symmetry
group larger than SO(2) could have a larger region of pseudogap behavior.
High-temperature superconductors may belong to that category of systems.

satisfies a special differential condition of the form, U[F]=0, the conformal
metric possesses a conformal Killing field, xi = partial with respect to s,
which in turn, allows the conformal metric to be mapped into a three
dimensional Lorentzian metric on the space (z,z',z'') or equivalently, on the
space of solutions of the original differential equation. This construction is
then generalized to the pair of differential equations, z_ss =

analogous to U[F]=0, namely equations of the form M[S,T]=0, the 6-space then
possesses a pair of conformal Killing fields, xi =partial with respect to s and
eta =partial with respect to t which allows, via the mapping to the four-space
of z, z_s, z_t, z_st and a choice of conformal factor, the construction of a
four-dimensional Lorentzian metric. In fact all four-dimensional Lorentzian

versus the order of the moment. This behavior is predicted by the NNLLA of

for the hadron level. Using the jet multiplicity distributions in order to vary
the dependence on the LPHD hypothesis, we find, however, that at our energy the
oscillations only appear for non-perturbative scales. In the absence of
confirmation of pQCD, we investigate a more phenomenological answer in the
possibility that the features seen in the Hq behavior could be due to the fact
that the charged-particle multiplicity derives from a superposition of final

precision in the determination of Delta may allow experiments to distinguish
between scalar mass unification at the GUT scale from the corresponding
unification at Q ~ M_Planck. Experimental determination of Delta would also
provide a distinction between the mSUGRA model and the recently proposed
gaugino-mediation model. Moreover, a measurement of Delta (or a related

the gluing formula for the eta-invariant is left obscure in the literature. In
this article we present a gluing formula for the eta-invariant which expresses
the integer contribution as a triple index involving the boundary conditions
and the Calderon projectors of the two parts of the decomposition. The main
ingredients of our presentation are the Scott-Wojciechowski theorem for the
determinant of a Dirac operator on a manifold with boundary and the approach of
Bruning-Lesch to the mod Z gluing formula.
  Our presentation includes careful constructions of the Maslov index and
triple index in a symplectic Hilbert space. As a byproduct we give intuitively
appealing proofs of two theorems of Nicolaescu on the spectral flow of Dirac
operators.
  As an application of our methods, we carry out a detailed analysis of the
eta-invariant of the odd signature operator coupled to a flat connection using
adiabatic methods. This is used to extend the definition of the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant to manifolds with boundary. We derive a
``non-additivity'' formula for the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant and
relate it to Wall's non-additivity formula for the signature of

relativistic Thomas-Fermi theory using the non-linear $\sigma-\omega -\rho$
model. The caloric curves are calculated by confining the nuclei in the
freeze-out volume taken to be a sphere of size about 4 to 8 times the normal
nuclear volume. The results obtained from the relativistic theory are not
significantly different from those obtained earlier in a non-relativistic
framework. The nature of the EOS and the peaked structure of the specific heat
$C_v$ obtained from the caloric curves show clear signals of a liquid-gas phase
transition in finite nuclei. The temperature evolution of the Gibbs potential
and the entropy at constant pressure indicate that the characteristics of the
transition are not too different from the first-order one.

and collaborators where superluminal behavior was observed in the propagation
of microwaves. We suggest that what was observed can be well approximated by
the motion of a superluminal X wave. Furthermore the experimental results are
also explained by the so called scissor effect which occurs with the
convergence of pairs of signals coming from opposite points of an annular
region of the mirror and forming an interference peak on the intersection axis
traveling at superluminal speed. We clarify some misunderstandings concerning
this kind of electromagnetic wave propagation in vacuum.

  Particle Interactions","9 pages, latex file",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  It is pointed that we now actually have no enough proofs to prove that time
reversal symmetry is universally obeyed in the processes of particle
interactions. The analyses show that the time reversal symmetry is obviously
violated at least in the decay processes of particles, especially in the decay
processes of strange particles, and some resonance states with only one middle
resonance particle to appear, as well as the annihilation processes of particle
pairs. So the phenomena of violating time reversal symmetry may exist commonly
in the interaction processes between particles.

Helmholtz and Mayer, were physicians. Thermodynamics studies the
transformations of energy, and such transformations ceaselessly take place in
all living systems (probably with important differences between the states of
health and disease). Moreover, thermodynamics studies the elusive notions of
order and disorder, which are also, respectively, the very hallmarks of life
and death. These similarities suggest that thermodynamics might provide a
unifying paradigm for many life sciences, explaining the multitude of life's
manifestations on the basis of a few basic physical principles. In this article
we introduce some basic thermodynamic concepts and point out their usefulness
for the biologist and the physician. We hope to show that thermodynamics
enables looking at the riddles of life from a new perspective and asking some

inequalities are naturally extended to the case of several states. It is shown
that these inequalities can be written in the equivalent complementary form.

their dynamics through a constraint. We specifically choose the Dirac procedure
of quantization before the introduction of constraints. Consequently, for field
theories, and prior to the introduction of any constraints, it is argued that
the original field operator representation should be ultralocal in order to
remain totally unbiased toward those field correlations that will be imposed by
the constraints. It is shown that relativistic free and interacting theories
can be completely recovered starting from ultralocal representations followed
by a careful enforcement of the appropriate constraints. In so doing all
unnecessary features of the original ultralocal representation disappear.
  The present discussion is germane to a recent theory of affine quantum
gravity in which ultralocal field representations have been invoked before the
imposition of constraints.

No.1 p.14-34 (2002)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss aspects of secure quantum communication by proposing and analyzing
a quantum analog of the Vernam cipher (one-time-pad). The quantum Vernam cipher
uses entanglement as the key to encrypt quantum information sent through an
insecure quantum channel. First, in sharp contrast with the classical Vernam
cipher, the quantum key can be recycled securely. We show that key recycling is
intrinsic to the quantum cipher-text, rather than using entanglement as the
key. Second, the scheme detects and corrects for arbitrary transmission errors,
and it does so using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
between the sender and the receiver. The application to quantum message
authentication is discussed. Quantum secret sharing schemes with similar
properties are characterized. We also discuss two general issues, the relation
between secret communication and secret sharing, the classification of secure
communication protocols.

  Individual Attacks","28 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.65.052310",,"quant-ph",,"  Security of the Ekert protocol is proven against individual attacks where an
eavesdropper is allowed to share any density matrix with the two communicating
parties. The density matrix spans all of the photon number states of both
receivers, as well as a probe state of arbitrary dimensionality belonging to
the eavesdropper. Using this general eavesdropping strategy, we show that the
Shannon information on the final key, after error correction and privacy
amplification, can be made exponentially small. This is done by finding a bound
on the eavesdropper's average collision probability. We find that the average
collision probability for the Ekert protocol is the same as that of the BB84
protocol for single photons, indicating that there is no analog in the Ekert
protocol to photon splitting attacks. We then compare the communication rate of
both protocols as a function of distance, and show that the Ekert protocol has
potential for much longer communication distances, up to 170km, in the presence
of realistic detector dark counts and channel loss. Finally, we propose a
slightly more complicated scheme based on entanglement swapping that can lead
to even longer distances of communication. The limiting factor in this new
scheme is the fiber loss, which imposes very slow communication rates at longer
distances.

many-body system containing the composite particles. In our treatment, the
modes associated with composite particles are regarded approximately as
independent ones compared with those of unbound particles. The field operators
of the composite particles thus arise naturally in the second quantization
Hamiltonian. To be emphasized, the second quantization Hamiltonian has the
regular structures which correspond clearly to different physical processes.

Lett. vol 12, No. 4 (1999), pp. 309-323",,,"quant-ph",,"  Time's apparent passage has long been debated by philosophers, with no
decisive argument for or against its objective existence. In this paper we show
that introducing the issue of determinism gives the debate a new, empirical
twist. We prove that any theory that states that the basic laws of physics are
time-symmetric must be strictly deterministic. It is only determinism that
enables time reversal, whether theoretical or experimental, of
anyentropy-increasing process. A contradiction therefore arises between
Hawking's argument that physical law is time-symmetric and his controversial
claim that black-hole evaporation introduces a fundamental unpredictability
into the physical world. The latter claim forcibly entails an intrinsic
time-arrow independent of boundary conditions. A simulation of a simple system
under time reversal shows how an intrinsic time arrow re-emerges, destroying
the time reversal, when even the slightest failure of determinism occurs. This
proof is then extended to the classical behavior of black holes. We conclude
with pointing out the affinity between time's arrow and its apparent passage.
