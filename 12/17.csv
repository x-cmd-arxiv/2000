and rotationally supported. The factors for the line broadening (rotation and
temperature) in the disks of the Be stars and the Be/X-ray binaries seem to be
identical.
  However, we do detect some intriguing differences between the envelopes. On
average, the circumstellar disks of the Be/X-ray binaries are twice as dense as
the disks of the isolated Be stars. The different distribution of the Be/X-ray
binaries and the Be stars seen in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) versus

fission into separate, particle-like entities, does not properly take into
account the failure of the adiabatic approximation when, due to tunneling,
there is a long electronic time scale. The point along the fission pathway of a
photoexcited p-state bubble, where the adiabatic approximation first breaks
down, occurs well before the bubble waist has pinched down forming two
cavities. In the connected two-lobed geometry, the p- and s-states are strongly
mixed by an antisymmetric vibrational mode, and the excitation decays by the
mechanism where one lobe collapses while the other expands into the spherical
s-state geometry. The extreme pressure jump in a photoexcited bubble leads to
shock formation that may halt the elongation even before adiabaticity is
compromised. In this case, the photoexcited bubble decays radiatively from the
relaxed p-state geometry.

the distribution function which describes the matter in phase space with a set

some indications that the critical behaviour in this model is of Type I (the

solution is a static spacetime with non-zero radial momentum for the individual

  files, figs 2-3 in picture environment within the main LaTeX file",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A simple, and elegant geometrical representation is developed to describe the
concept of coherence and squeezing for angular momentum operators. Angular
momentum squeezed states were obtained by applying Bogoliubov transformation on
the angular momentum coherent states in Schwinger representation [Phys. Rev.
{\bf{A 51}} (1995)]. We present the geometrical phase space description of
angular momentum coherent and squeezed states and relate with the harmonic
oscillator. The unique feature of our geometric representation is the
portraying of the expectation values of the angular momentum components
accompanied by their uncertainties. The bosonic representation of the angular
momentum coherent and squeezed states is compared with the conventional one
mentioning the advantages of this representation of angular momentum in context
of coherence and squeezing. Extension of our work on single mode squeezing to
double mode squeezing is presented and compared with the single mode one. We
also point out the possible applications of the geometrical representation in
analyzing the accuracy of interferometers and in studying the behavior,
dynamics of an ensemble of quantum-mechanical two-level systems and its
interaction with radiation.

  Computing in Science and Engineering""",,"10.1109/5992.909000",,"quant-ph",,"  Amongst the most remarkable successes of quantum computation are Shor's
efficient quantum algorithms for the computational tasks of integer
factorisation and the evaluation of discrete logarithms. In this article we
review the essential ingredients of these algorithms and draw out the unifying
generalization of the so-called abelian hidden subgroup problem. This involves
an unexpectedly harmonious alignment of the formalism of quantum physics with
the elegant mathematical theory of group representations and fourier transforms
on finite groups. Finally we consider the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem
mentioning some open questions where future quantum algorithms may be expected
to have a substantial impact.

has been used extensively in the ion trap experiments. We solve this
interaction in the absence of the rotating wave approximation by a continued
fraction, without considering the restriction of the Lamb-Dicke limit and the
weak excitation regime. Some interesting characteristics of the ion-trap
system, particularly for the ion outside the weak excitation regime are found.
Finally, a comparison of our results with the solution under the rotating wave
approximation is made.
