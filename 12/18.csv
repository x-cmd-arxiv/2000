We use a sample of 10558 QSOs taken from the preliminary catalogue of the 2dF
QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). The two-point redshift-space correlation function of
QSOs is shown to follow a power law on scales s~1-35h-1Mpc. Fitting a power law
to QSO clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.3<z<2.9 we find
s_0=3.99+0.28-0.34h-1Mpc and gamma=1.58+0.10-0.09 for an Einstein-de Sitter
cosmology (EdS). With Omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 the power law extends to
s~60h-1Mpc with a best fit of s_0=5.69+0.42-0.50h-1Mpc and
gamma=1.56+0.10-0.09. These values, measured at a mean redshift of z=1.49, are
comparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. We measure
the evolution of QSO clustering as a function of redshift. For an EdS cosmology
there is no evolution in comoving coordinates over the redshift range of the
2QZ. For Omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 QSO clustering shows a marginal increase
at high redshift. Although the clustering of QSOs is measured on large scales
where linear theory should apply, the evolution of QSO clustering does not
follow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability
(rejected at the >99 per cent confidence level). A redshift dependent bias is
required to reconcile QSO clustering observations with theory. A simple biasing
model, in which QSOs have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively form
in peaks above a constant threshold in the density field) is acceptable in an
EdS cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if Omega_0=0.3 and
lambda_0=0.7. Biasing models which assume QSOs form over a range in redshift,
based on the Press-Schechter formalism are approximately consistent with QSO
clustering evolution (abridged).

relatively important source of the accretion disk cooling when the mass
accretion rate is low, and stars are passing outer parts of the hot accretion

round elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relations
of ellipticals: (i) The circular velocity curves (CVCs) of elliptical galaxies
are flat to within ~10% for R>~0.2R_e. (ii) Most ellipticals are moderately
radially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)
Elliptical galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/s
for an L_B^* galaxy. At given v_c^max, they are ~1 mag fainter in B and appear
to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals even for maximum M/L_B. (iv)
The luminosity dependence of M/L_B is confirmed. The tilt of the Fundamental
Plane is not caused by dynamical non-homology, nor only by an increasing dark
matter fraction with L. It is, however, consistent with stellar population
models based on published metallicities and ages. The main driver is therefore
probably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explain
the K-band tilt. (v) These results make it likely that elliptical galaxies have
nearly maximal M/L_B (minimal halos). (vi) Despite the uniformly flat CVCs,
there is a spread in cumulative M/L_B(r). Some galaxies have no indication for
dark matter within 2R_e, whereas others have local M/L_Bs of 20-30 at 2R_e.
(vii) In models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10-40%
of the mass within R_e. (viii) The corresponding halo core densities and
phase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4
times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same v_c^max. The increase in M/L
sets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. This could imply that
elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshift or that some of the dark
matter in ellipticals might be baryonic. (abridged)

optical measurements of the host globular clusters. This implies that there is
little intrinsic X-ray absorption within the binaries themselves, and that the
above spectral model provides a good representation of the low-energy continua.
The sources can be divided into two groups. In the first group, composed of 3
ultra-compact (orbital period <1hr) sources, the disk-blackbody temperatures

temperatures and radii of the emission areas are consistent with the disk
temperatures and inner radii. For all the other sources, the disk-blackbody
parameters appear not to be physically realistic and the Comptonization
parameters are unrelated to those of the disk-blackbody emission. If this is a
spectral signature of ultra-compact binaries, this implies that no other
ultra-compact binaries are present among those studied here. It is unclear why
this difference between the two types of binaries should exist.

the stripping event. Furthermore, the gas which is located at radii >60'' is
part of an asymmetric expanding ring of gas clouds. A substantial part of these

a 180 degree tilt, effectively reversing the charge on the vortex as observed

The phase transition is of second order. The corresponding quadrupole order

give an introduction to Replica Monte Carlo algorithm by Swendsen and Wang.
Strategies for the construction of special-purpose extended ensembles are
discussed in Sec.7. We stress that an extension is not necessary restricted to
the space of energy or temperature. Even unphysical (unrealizable)
configurations can be included in the ensemble, if the resultant fast mixing of
the Markov chain offsets the increasing cost of the sampling procedure.
Multivariate (multi-component) extensions are also useful in many examples. In
Sec.8, we give a survey on extended ensembles with a state space whose
dimensionality is dynamically varying. In the appendix, we discuss advantages

sand in the wheels of the economy. Demands to replace our monumental tax code
with a simple, graceful one that does not distort economic incentives heat up
periodically in political debate, but such dreams never materialize. A
FUNDAMENTAL obstacle, not yet well understood in the economic literature, is
the impossibility of objectively evaluating the tax base -- assets, income,
etc. One can see this even in toy examples, say, trying to assess the value of
a position in chess: great masters' assessments will all differ. Here computer
theory can add an insight not provided by classical economics tools.
  A way around is to avoid evaluations by expressing the tax in natural units,
not in cash. For publicly traded corporations, these could be corporate shares.
I discuss a simple (postcard-sized in ALL details) corporate tax system that
avoids ANY distortion of incentives. (Tax tools MEANT to influence corporate
policies should be set as explicit separate taxes or credits, open to public
scrutiny, not hidden between lines of an incomprehensible tax code.) Roughly,
the~system is to periodically take a t*i fraction of shares to auction, where t
is the tax rate, i is the interest rate. It replaces all income taxes on
publicly traded corporations, their subsidiaries, and shareholders.
  The interest rate is defined via specially designed bonds, so that the whole
system can be shown PRECISELY equivalent to a flat tax on INVESTMENT RETURN.
Note that taxing the return DIRECTLY is impossible: it would invite
manipulation of stock market~prices. The main feature is that nothing
corporations and investors do can change their tax (t*i fraction of shares), so
they would do business exactly the SAME WAY they would WITHOUT TAXES.

1/N_c and an expansion up to one-meson loop in the effective action formalism.
It is explicitely proved that the Goldstone theorem as well as the
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation hold within those schemes. The influence of
meson-loop effects on the quark condensate, the pion mass, the pion decay
constant and properties of rho- and sigma-meson are investigated. First we
focus on the determination of a consistent set of parameters. In the 1/N_c
expansion scheme it is possible to find a set of parameters which allows to
simultaneously describe the quantities in the pion sector and those related to
the rho-meson, whereas this turns out to be not possible within the expansion
of the effective action. Besides, the relation of our model to hadronic models
is discussed. In the last part of this thesis the behavior of the quark
condensate at nonzero temperature is studied. In the low-temperature region
agreement with the model independent chiral perturbation theory result in
lowest order can be obtained. The perturbative 1/N_c expansion scheme does not

general case of the zeta function associated to a quadratic+linear+constant
form (in {\bf Z}) are obtained. They provide the analytical continuation of the
zeta functions in question to the whole complex $s-$plane, in terms of series
of Bessel functions (of fast, exponential convergence), thus being extended
Chowla-Selberg formulas. As well known, this is the most convenient expression
that can be found for the analytical continuation of a zeta function, in
particular, the residua of the poles and their finite parts are explicitly
given there. An important novelty is the fact that simple poles show up at
$s=0$, as well as in other places (simple or double, depending on the number of
compactified, noncompactified, and noncommutative dimensions of the spacetime),
where they had never appeared before. This poses a challenge to the
zeta-function regularization procedure.

generated in supersymmetric compactifications. The compactification we consider
is the supersymmetric extension of the Randall-Sundrum model. The crucial issue
is the stabilization of the radius modulus for large warp factor. The
stabilization sector we employ is very simple, consisting of two pure
Yang--Mills sectors, one in the bulk and the other localized on a brane. The
only fine-tuning required in our model is the cancellation of the cosmological
constant, achieved by balancing the stabilization energy against supersymmetry
breaking effects. Exponentially large warp factors arise naturally, with no
very large or small input parameters. To perform the analysis, we derive the
4-dimensional effective theory for the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum model,
with a careful treatment of the radius modulus. The manifestly (off-shell)
supersymmetric form of this effective lagrangian allows a straightforward and
systematic treatment of the non-perturbative dynamics of the stabilization
sector.

conference on higher local fields held in Muenster, August 29 to September 5,
1999. The aim is to provide an introduction to higher local fields (more
generally complete discrete valuation fields with arbitrary residue field) and
render the main ideas of this theory (Part I), as well as to discuss several
applications and connections to other areas (Part II).
  The volume grew as an extended version of talks given at the conference. The
two parts are separated by a paper of K. Kato, an IHES preprint from 1980 which
has never been published.
  We hope that the volume will be a useful introduction and guide to the
subject. The contributions to this volume were received over the period
November 1999 to August 2000 and the electronic publication date is 10 December
2000. This is the introduction: math.NT/0012131.

in a noisy bistable system driven by various input signals. To characterize the
response of a stochastic bistable system we introduce a new measure based on
the calculation of a singularity spectrum for a return time sequence. We use
wavelet transform modulus maxima method for the singularity spectrum
computations. It is shown that the degree of multifractality defined as a width
of singularity spectrum can be successfully used as a measure of complexity
both in the case of periodic and aperiodic (stochastic or chaotic) input
signals. We show that in the case of periodic driving force singularity
spectrum can change its structure qualitatively becoming monofractal in the
regime of stochastic synchronization. This fact allows us to consider the
degree of multifractality as a new measure of stochastic synchronization also.
Moreover, our calculations have shown that the effect of stochastic resonance
can be catched by this measure even from a very short return time sequence. We
use also the proposed approach to characterize the noise-enhanced dynamics of a
coupled stochastic neurons model.

not converge to any stationary distribution, as they are unitary and

  However, by suitably relaxing the definition, we can obtain a measure of how
fast the quantum walk spreads or how confined the quantum walk stays in a small
neighborhood. We give definitions of mixing time, filling time, dispersion
time. We show that in all these measures, the quantum walk on the cycle is
almost quadratically faster then its classical correspondent. On the other
hand, we give a lower bound on the possible speed up by quantum walks for
general graphs, showing that quantum walks can be at most polynomially faster

outcome but into a greater probability for it. The probability can approach
100%, yet the measurement can undergo complete quantum erasure. In the EPR
setting, we prove that i) every partial measurement nonlocally creates the same
partial change in the distant particle; and ii) every erasure inflicts the same
erasure on the distant particle's state. This enables an EPR experiment where
the nonlocal effect does not vanish after a single measurement but keeps
""traveling"" back and forth between particles. We study an experiment in which
two distant particles are subjected to interferometry with a partial ""which
path"" measurement. Such a measurement causes a variable amount of correlation
between the particles. A new inequality is formulated for same-angle
polarizations, extending Bell's inequality for different angles. The resulting
nonlocality proof is highly visualizable, as it rests entirely on the
interference effect. Partial measurement also gives rise to a new form of
entanglement, where the particles manifest correlations of multiple
polarization directions. Another novelty in that the measurement to be erased
is fully observable, in contrast to prevailing erasure techniques where it can
never be observed. Some profound conceptual implications of our experiment are
briefly pointed out.

d-dimensional Hilbert space utilizing the positive operator valued measurement
at the sending station. The conclusive teleportation protocol ensures some
perfect teleportation events when the channel is only partially entangled, at
the expense of lowering the overall average fidelity. We find the change of the
fidelity as optimizing the conclusive teleportation events and discuss how much
information remains in the inconclusive parts of the teleportation.
