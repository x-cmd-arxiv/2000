to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results and the
uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of
these results for cosmology. The analysis presented here benefits from a number
of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid
sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more
recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration,
(3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for
incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. New, revised distances
are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as
part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published
Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in
better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised
Cepheid distances, we find values (in km/sec/Mpc) of H0 = 71 +/- 2 (random) +/-
6 (systematic) (type Ia supernovae), 71 +/- 2 +/- 7 (Tully-Fisher relation), 70
+/- 5 +/- 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), 72 +/- 9 +/- 7 (type II
supernovae), and 82 +/- 6 +/- 9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results
for the different methods with 3 different weighting schemes, and find good
agreement and consistency with H0 = 72 +/- 8. Finally, we compare these results
with other, global methods for measuring the Hubble constant.

that the shape of a galaxy's rotation curve strongly depends on its location
within the cluster, and thus presumably on the strength of the local
intracluster medium and on the frequency and strength of tidal interactions
with the cluster and cluster galaxies. Our data do not corroborate such a
scenario, consistent with the fact that Tully-Fisher residuals are independent
of galaxy location within the cluster; while the average late-type spiral
galaxy shows more rise in the outer parts of its rotation curve than does the
typical early-type spiral galaxy, there is no apparent trend for either subset
with cluster environment. We also investigate as a function of cluster
environment rotation curve asymmetry and the radial distribution of H II region
tracers within galactic disks. Mild trends with projected cluster-centric
distance are observed: (i) the (normalized) radial extent of optical line
emission averaged over all spiral galaxy types shows a 4%+/-2% increase per Mpc
of galaxy-cluster core separation, and (ii) rotation curve asymmetry falls by a
factor of two between the inner and outer cluster for early-type spirals (a
negligible decrease is found for late-type spirals). Such trends are consistent
with spiral disk perturbations or even the stripping of the diffuse, outermost
gaseous regions within the disks as galaxies pass through the dense cluster
cores.

curves of eclipsing binary stars, focussing mainly upon systems containing at
least one white dwarf component. In absolute terms the effects are small,
however they are strongest at the time of secondary eclipse when the white
dwarf transits its companion, and act to reduce the depth of this feature. If
not accounted for, this may lead to under-estimation of the radius of the white
dwarf compared to that of its companion. I show that the effect is significant
for plausible binary parameters, and that it leads to ~25% reduction in the
transit depth in the system KPD 1930+2752. The reduction of eclipse depth is
degenerate with the stellar radius ratio, and therefore cannot be used to
establish the existence of lensing. A second order effect of the light bending
is to steepen the ingress and egress features of the secondary eclipse relative
to the primary eclipse, although it will be difficult to see this in practice.
I consider also binaries containing neutron stars and black-holes. I conclude
that, although relatively large effects are possible in such systems, a
combination of rarity, faintness and intrinsic variability make it unlikely
that lensing will be detectable in them.

investigate a scenario in which 5 < N < 100 planetary mass objects are assumed
to form rapidly through a fragmentation process occuring in a disc or
protostellar envelope on a scale of 100 au.
  These are assumed to have formed rapidly enough through gravitational
instability or fragmentation that their orbits can undergo dynamical relaxation
on a timescale of about 100 orbits.
  Under a wide range of initial conditions and assumptions the relaxation
process ends with either (i) one potential 'hot Jupiter' plus up to two
'external' companions, i.e. planets orbiting near the outer edge of the initial
distribution; (ii) one or two 'external' planets or even none at all; (iii) one
planet on an orbit with a semi--major axis 10 to a 100 times smaller than the
outer boundary radius of the inital distribution together with an 'external'
companion. Most of the other objects are ejected and could contribute to a
population of free floating planets. Apart from the potential 'hot Jupiters',
all the bound objects are on highly eccentric orbits. We found that, apart from
the close orbiters, the probability of ending up with a planet orbiting at a
given distance from the central star increases with the distance. This is
because of the tendency of the relaxation process to lead to collisions with
the central star.
  We discuss the application of these results to some of the more massive
extrasolar planets.

test for the most likely progenitors of GRBs. Those stars that shed their
envelopes most readily have short jet crossing times and are more likely to
produce a GRB. We construct a simple computational scheme to explore the
expected contribution of the presupernova ejecta of single Wolf-Rayet (WR)
stars to the circumstellar environment. Using detailed stellar tracks for the
evolution of massive stars, we discuss the effects that the initial main
sequence mass, metallicity, rotation and membership in a binary system have on
the ambient medium. We extend the theory of GRB afterglows in winds to consider
the effect of the relativistic fireball propagating through the WR ejecta. We
make specific predictions for the interaction of the relativistic blast wave
with the density bumps that arise when the progenitor star rapidly loses a
large fraction of its initial mass or when the ejected wind interacts with the
external medium and decelerates. A re-brightening of the afterglow with a
spectrum redder than the typical synchrotron spectrum (as seen in GRB 970508,
GRB 980326 and GRB 000911) is predicted. We also calculate the luminosity of
the reflected echo that arises when circumstellar material Compton-scatters the
prompt radiation and examine the spectral signatures expected from the

presence of giant extrasolar planets at small distances from their host stars,
is strongly correlated with high metallicity of the host stars. The presence of
these close-orbiting giants is incompatible with the existence of earth-like
planets. Thus, there may be a Goldilocks selection effect: with too little
metallicity, earths are unable to form for lack of material, with too much
metallicity giant planets destroy earths. Here I quantify these effects and
obtain the probability, as a function of metallicity, for a stellar system to
harbour an earth-like planet. I combine this probability with current estimates
of the star formation rate and of the gradual build up of metals in the

earth-like planets in the Universe are older than the Earth and that their

statistically identical to one observed previously with Beppo/SAX, and close,
but not identical, to one observed previously with ASCA. The X-ray spectrum is
best described as a pure Hydrogen atmosphere thermal spectrum plus a power-law
component that dominates the spectrum above 2 keV. The best-fit radius of the
neutron star is r=12.9+/-2.6 (d/1.2 kpc) km if the interstellar absorption is
fixed at the value implied by the optical reddening. Allowing the interstellar
absorption to be a free parameter yields r=19+45-10 (d/1.2 kpc) km (90%

with a solar metallicity. We find a 3sigma upper-limit of root-mean-square

other hand, the 0.5-10.0 keV luminosity decreased by 40+/-8% in the 4.9 years

to the power-law component. Moreover, we limit the variation in thermal

reversals, or the reversals are signatures of large-scale anisotropic field
loops. The Galaxy is surrounded by a thick disk of radio continuum emission of
similar extent as in edge-on spiral galaxies. While the local field in the thin
disk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the global

opportunities to probe large scale intergalactic gas flows outside clusters of
galaxies. New radio images of high surface brightness sensitivity at
strategically chosen wavelengths of the giant radio galaxy NGC 315 (Mack et al.
1997,1998) reveal significant asymmetries and particularities in the
morphology, radio spectrum and polarization of the ejected radio plasma. We
argue that the combination of these signatures provides a sensitive probe of an
environmental shock wave. Analysis of optical redshifts in NGC 315 vicinity
confirms its location to be near, or at a site of large-scale flow collisions
in the 100 Mpc sized Pisces-Perseus Supercluster region. NGC 315 resides at the
intersection of several galaxy filaments, and its radio plasma serves there as
a `weather station' (Burns 1998) probing the flow of the elusive and previously
invisible IGM gas. If our interpretation is correct, this is the first
indication for a shock wave in flows caused by the cosmological large scale
structure formation, which is located in a filament of galaxies. The
possibility that the putative shock wave is a source of gamma-rays and ultra
high energy cosmic rays is briefly discussed.

angula r momentum, also called spin current. In multilayers, spatial variations
of the spin current correspond to drive torques exerted on a magnetic layer.
These torq ues result in spin precession above a certain current threshold. The
usual kind of spin current is associated with translation of the spin-up and
spin-down Ferm i surfaces in momentum space. We discuss a different kind of
spin current, assoc iated with expansion and contraction of the Fermi surfaces.
It is more nonlocal in nature, and may exist even in locations where the
electrical current density is zero. It is larger than the usual spin current,
in a ratio of 10 or 100, and is dominant in most cases. The new spin current is
proportional to the differenc e Delta-mu = 0.001 eV between spin-up and
spin-down Fermi levels, averaged over the entire Fermi surface. Conduction
processes, spin relaxation, and spin-wave emission in the multilayer can be
described by an equivalent electrical circuit resembling an unbalanced dc
Wheatstone bridge. And Delta-mu corresponds to the output voltage of the
bridge.

dependence of dc voltage on a strength, frequency, and relative phase of mixing
harmonics for an arbitrary even value of n.
  We show that the generated dc voltage has a maximum when a frequency of ac
field is of the order of a scattering constant of electrons in a superlattice.
This means that for typical semiconductor superlattices at room temperature
operating in the THz frequency domain the effect is really observable.
  We also made a comparison of a recent paper describing an effect of a
directed current generation in a semiconductor superlattice subjected by ac
field and its second harmonic (n=2) [K.Seeger, Appl.Phys.Lett. 76(2000)82] with
our earlier findings describing the same effect [K.Alekseev et al., Europhys.

additionally to the phase-shift controlling of the dc current, there is a
frequency control. This frequency controlling of the dc current direction is
absent in the case of n=2. The found effect is that, both the dc current
suppression and the dc current reversals exist for some particular values of ac
field frequency. For typical semiconductor superlattices such an interesting
behavior of the dc current should be observable also in the THz domain.

Experimentally, the local velocity fluctuations are found to vary as a power of
the local velocity gradient. This can be explained by an effective viscosity
that diverges more rapidly as the random-close-packing density is approached
than is predicted by Enskog theory for dense hard sphere systems. Experiment
and theory are in good agreement, especially for the following key features of
granular flow: The flow is confined to a small shear band, fluctuations decay
approximately exponentially away from the sheared wall, and the shear stress is
approximately independent of shear rate. The functional forms of the velocity

$A/4G\hbar=\pi(2n+p+1)$, where the integer p=0,1,2,.. gives the charge
spectrum, with $Q=\pm\sqrt{\hbar p}$. The quantity $\pi(2n+1)$, n=0,1,... gives
a measure of the excess of the mass/energy over the critical minimum (i.e.
extremal) value allowed for a given fixed charge Q. The classical critical
bound cannot be saturated due to vacuum fluctuations of the horizon, so that
generically extremal black holes do not appear in the physical spectrum.
Consistency also requires the black hole charge to be an integer multiple of
any fundamental elementary particle charge: $Q= \pm me$, m=0,1,2,.... As a
by-product this yields a relation between the fine structure constant and
integer parameters of the black hole -- a kind of the Coleman big fix mechanism
induced by black holes. In four dimensions, this relationship is
$e^2/\hbar=p/m^2$ and requires the fine structure constant to be a rational
number. Finally, we prove that the horizon area is an adiabatic invariant, as
has been conjectured previously.

varies over the extra dimensions due to different warp factors for the space
and the time coordinates (``asymmetrically warped'' spacetimes). The main
property of such spaces is that while the induced metric is flat, implying
Lorentz invariant particle physics on a brane, bulk gravitational effects will
cause apparent violations of Lorentz invariance and of causality from the brane
observer's point of view. An important experimentally verifiable consequence of
this is that gravitational waves may travel with a speed different from the
speed of light on the brane, and possibly even faster. We find the most general
spacetimes of this sort, which are given by AdS-Schwarzschild or
AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, assuming the simplest possible sources in
the bulk. Due to the gravitational Lorentz violations these models do not have
an ordinary Lorentz invariant effective description, and thus provide a
possible way around Weinberg's no-go theorem for the adjustment of the
cosmological constant. Indeed we show that the cosmological constant may relax
in such theories by the adjustment of the mass and the charge of the black
hole. The black hole singularity in these solutions can be protected by a
horizon, but the existence of a horizon requires some exotic energy densities
on the brane. We investigate the cosmological expansion of these models and
speculate that it may provide an explanation for the accelerating Universe,
provided that the timescale for the adjustment is shorter than the Hubble time.
In this case the accelerating Universe would be a manifestation of
gravitational Lorentz violations in extra dimensions.

concerned with the following problem : Is there a flat family over Spec${\bf

variety? Our approach of the problem is based on the canonical/global base of
Lusztig/Kashiwara and the so-called string parametrization of this base studied
by P. Littelmann and made precise by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinsky. Fix $w$
in $W$ and let $P^+$ be the semigroup of dominant weights. For all $\lambda$ in
$P^+$, let ${\cal L}_\lambda$ be the line bundle on $G/B$ corresponding to
$\lambda$. Then, the direct sum of global sections $R_w:=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in
P^+}H^0(X_w,{\cal L}_\lambda)$ carries a natural structure of $P^+$-graded
${\bf C}$-algebra. Moreover, there exists a natural action of $T$ on $R_w$. Our
principal result can be stated as follows : There exists a filtration $({\cal
F}_m^w)_{m\in{\bf N}}$ of $R_w$ such that (i) for all $m$ in ${\bf N}$, ${\cal
F}_m^w$ is compatible with the $P^+$-grading of $R_w$, (ii) for all $m$ in
${\bf N}$, ${\cal F}_m^w$ is compatible with the action of $T$, (iii) the
associated graded algebra is the ${\bf C}$-algebra of the semigroup of integral
points in a rational convex polyhedral cone. Equations for this cone were
obtained by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinski from $\tilde w_0$-trails in
fundamental Weyl modules of the Langlands dual of $G$. By standard arguments,
the previous theorem gives a positive answer to the Degeneration Problem.

two-dimensional proof. QS has a manifold structure modelled on a Banach space,
and after factorization by PSL(2,R} it becomes a complex manifold. This
quotient space contains deformation spaces of many types of dynamical system
and for every hyperbolic Riemann surface, and in this naive sense it is
universal. Here however, we focus on the analytic foundations of the theory
necessary for applications to dynamical systems and rigidity. We divide the
paper into two parts. The first part concerns the real theory of QS and results
that can be stated purely in real terms; the basic properties are given mostly
without proof, except in certain cases when an easy real-variable proof is
available. The second part of the paper brings in the complex analysis and
promotes the view that properties of quasisymmetric maps are most easily
understood by consideration of their possible two-dimensional quasiconformal
extensions.

  systems","23 pages. To appear in Topological Methods in Nonlinear Analysis",,,"Bath Mathematics Preprint 98\21","math.AP",,"  We are concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of classical solutions of
systems of the form u_t = Au_xx + f(u, u_x), x in R, t>0, u(x,t) a vector in
RN, with u(x,0)= U(x), where A is a positive-definite diagonal matrix and f is
a 'bistable' nonlinearity satisfying conditions which guarantee the existence
of a comparison principle. Suppose that there is a travelling-front solution w
with velocity c, that connects two stable equilibria of f. We show that if U is
bounded, uniformly continuously differentiable and such that w(x) - U(x) is
small when the modulus of x is large, then there exists y in R such that u(.,
t) converges to w(.+y-ct) in the C1 norm at an exponential rate as t tends to
infinity. Our approach extends an idea developed by Roquejoffre, Terman and
Volpert in the convectionless case, where f is independent of u_x.

bound states is presented which is formulated in an explicitly covariant
manner. The relativistic bound state problem for three quarks is considered.
Diquarks are introduced as separable correlations in the two-quark correlation
function and thereby baryons are described by a Bethe-Salpeter equation for
bound states of quark and diquark which interact by quark exchange. In analogy
to the meson spectrum, scalar and axialvector diquarks are considered to be the
most important two-quark configurations within baryons. The numerical solutions
of the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation are subsequently employed in the
calculation of electromagnetic, strong and axial form factors of the nucleons.
The construction of the electromagnetic current operator in the diquark-quark
model respects gauge invariance. Invariance under chiral symmetry
transformations is slightly violated for vector diquarks have been neglected,
leading to a modest violation of the Goldberger-Treiman relation. The
possibility of an effective parametrization of confinement by suitable
modifications of the quark and diquark propagators is investigated. It is shown
that the modelling of confinement chosen here is suitable for the calculation
of the octet and devuplet spectrum and spacelike nucleon properties, but its
applicability breaks down for processes where large energies are transferred to
the nucleon as it is the case in certain meson production processes. Model
solutions for nucleon wave functions and observables are compared between the
full relativistic treatment and a widely used semi-relativistic approximation.
The considerable deviations in the results illustrate the inadequacy of
employing the semi-relativistic treatment.

vibrational ion dynamics using a formal analogy with the solid-state problem of
electron localization. In particular, we show how the resonant approximation

two-dimensional (2D) to a one-dimensional problem (1D) of electron
localization. The localization length in the solid-state problem is estimated
