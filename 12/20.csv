Comptonization in X-ray binaries. In LMXB, the radius of the ADC is shown to be

approximate equality between the height of the blackbody emission region on the

either that there is a direct causal link, such as a radial accretion flow
between the inner disk edge and the star, or an indirect link, as in the case
of accretion flow creep on the surface of the neutron star as suggested by
Inogamov & Sunyaev. Finally, the survey shows that the blackbody cannot

11 M_sun. An accurate position for the pulsar was obtained using the Australia

with the pulsar position. However, we do not believe that this star is the
pulsar's companion, because a typical star of this spectral type and required
mass would extend beyond the pulsar's orbit. Furthermore, the measured advance
of periastron of the pulsar suggests a more compact companion, for example, a
main-sequence star with radius only a few times that of the sun. Such a
companion is also more consistent with the small dispersion measure variations
seen near periastron. Although we cannot conclusively rule out a black-hole
companion, we believe the companion is probably an early B star, making the
system similar to the binary PSR J0045-7319.

interesting features. The Ni II spectrum exhibits avoided level crossing
phenomenon under variation of alpha and the intervals between the levels have
strong nonlinear dependencies on relativistic corrections. The values of the
transition frequency shifts, due to the change of alpha, vary significantly
from state to state including change of the sign. This enhances the sensitivity
to the variation of alpha and reduces possible systematic errors. The

limit is consistent with the relation between the central BH mass and velocity
dispersion M_BH - sigma known for other galaxies. The emission line ratios
place the nucleus of NGC 2681 among LINERs. It is likely that the emission line
region comes from a rather mild, but steady, feeding of gas to the central BH
in this galaxy. The inner stellar population lacks any measurable color
gradient (to a radius of 0.6 kpc) from the infrared to the ultraviolet,
consistently with FOC, FOS and IUE data, all indicating that this system
underwent a starburst ~1 Gyr ago that encompassed its whole interior, down to
its very center. The most likely source of such a widely-distributed starburst

show that as the degree of differential rotation is increased, it becomes more
difficult to solve r-mode oscillations for slightly deformed configurations

points appear near the surface region if the degree of differential rotation is

conserved and advected towards the disc centre by the radial flow. We confirm
that accretion flows of magnitude several km/s through a significant part of
the galactic disc can markedly inhibit dynamo action. Moreover, advection of
the vertical flux in general results in mixed parity galactic fields. However,
the effect is nonlinear and non-additive -- global magnetic field energies are
usually significantly smaller that the sum of purely dynamo generated and
purely advected field energies. For large inflow speeds, a form of
`semi-dynamo' action may occur.
  We apply our results to the accumulation and redistribution, by a radial
inflow, of a vertical magnetic flux captured by the Galactic disc. Taking
representative values, it appears difficult to obtain mean vertical fields near
the centre of the Milky Way that are much in excess of 10 microgauss, largely
because the galactic dynamo and turbulent magnetic diffusion modify the
external magnetic field before it can reach the disc centre.

in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method. Compared with the
graded approach, this approach has several advantages. First, the global
properties of the Hamiltonian are naturally reflected in the algebraic
properties of the fermionic R-operator. We want to note that this operator is a
local operator acting on fermion Fock spaces. In particular, SO(4) symmetry and
the invariance under the partial particle hole transformation are discussed.
Second, we can construct a genuinely fermionic quantum transfer transfer matrix
(QTM) in terms of the fermionic R-operator. Using the algebraic Bethe Ansatz
for the Hubbard model, we diagonalize the fermionic QTM and discuss its
properties.

striking resemblance to guided vortex motion as it was observed in YBCO single

leads to unique Yukawa coupling matrices with zero textures. Thirteen
parameters involving masses and mixing angles in the quark and charged lepton

mixing angles for the neutrino sector could also be predicted by constructing
an appropriate heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix without involving new

may simultaneously be explained, but solar neutrino puzzle can be solved only
by introducing a sterile neutrino. An additional parameter is added to obtain
the mass and mixing of the sterile neutrino. The hadronic parameters $B_{K}$

$F_0^{B\pi}(0)$: $F_0^{B\pi}(0)=0.25 \pm 0.03$; (b) the new physics
enhancements to the penguin-dominated $B \to K\pi$ and $B\to K \etap$ decays
are significant in size, $\sim (40-70)%$ $w.r.t$ the standard model
predictions; and (c) the new physics enhancements can boost the branching
ratios ${\cal B}(B \to K^+ \etap)$ and ${\cal B}(B \to K^0 \etap)$ to be
consistent with the data within one standard deviation, and hence lead to a
simple and plausible new physics interpretation for the $\etap K$ puzzle.

with the prediction of the QCD factorization approach. Whereas the QCD
factorization can only take into account the nonfactorizable corrections
induced by hard-gluon exchanges, the method suggested here also allows a
systematic inclusion of soft-gluon effects. In this paper, I concentrate on the

different topologies and operators and to various other B-decay channels. I

contributions are considered: two of them can be identified with well known
amplitudes; the (identical) QED vacuum polarization tensor and the (closely

most general form (to include in our discussion automatically the question of
ambiguities) on the point of view of a strategy to manipulate and calculate
divergent amplitudes that can avoid the explicit calculation of divergent
integrals. Rather than this only general properties are used in intermediary
steps. With this treatment, the results obtained by others authors can be
easily recovered and we show that, if we choose to impose U(1) gauge invariance
maintenance in the pure QED calculated amplitudes, to be consistent with the
renormalizability, the induced Chern-Simons term assumes a nonvanishing
ambiguities free value. However if, in addition, we choose to get an answer
consistent with renormalizability by anomaly cancellation of the Standard Model
a vanishing value can be obtained, in accordance with what was previously
conjectured by other authors.

the symplectic leaves of the corresponding W-algebra, which are the
intersection of the defining constraint and the coadjoint orbit of the affine
Lie algebra if the W-algebra in question is obtained by reducing a WZNW model.
The fields that survive the reduction will obey non-linear Poisson bracket (or
commutator) relations in general. For example the Toda models are well-known
theories which possess such a non-linear W-symmetry and many features of these
models can only be understood if one investigates the reduction procedure. In
this paper we analyze the SL(n,R) case from which the so-called W_n-algebras
can be obtained. One advantage of the reduction viewpoint is that it gives a
constructive way to classify the symplectic leaves of the W-algebra which we
had done in the n=2 case which will correspond to the coadjoint orbits of the
Virasoro algebra and for n=3 which case gives rise to the Zamolodchikov
algebra. Our method in principle is capable of constructing explicit
representatives on each leaf. Another attractive feature of this approach is
the fact that the global nature of the W-transformations can be explicitly
described. The reduction method also enables one to determine the ``classical
highest weight (h. w.) states'' which are the stable minima of the energy on a
W-leaf. These are important as only to those leaves can a highest weight
representation space of the W-algebra be associated which contains a
``classical h. w. state''.

segments with anomalous and normal dispersion, whose lengths are picked up
randomly from a certain interval, is considered. At the first stage of the
analysis, we calculate small changes of parameters of a quasi-Gaussian pulse
passing a two-segment cell by means of the variational approach (VA), and
approximate the evolution of the pulse passing many cells by smoothed ODEs with
random coefficients, which are then solved numerically. Next, we perform
systematic direct simulations of the model. Results are presented as
dependences of the pulse's mean width, and standard deviation of the width from
its mean value, on the propagation distance. The results produced by VA and
direct simulations are similar. Averaging over 200 different realizations of
the random-length set reveals slow long-scale dynamics of the pulse, frequently
in the form of long-period oscillations of its width. It is thus found that the
soliton is most stable in the case of the zero path-average dispersion (PAD),
less stable in the case of anomalous PAD, and least stable in the case of
normal PAD. The soliton's stability also strongly depends on its energy, the
soliton with small energy being much more robust than its large-energy
counterpart.

equations of the Faddeev type are applicable to reactions of three charged
particles, in particular above the three-body threshold. For, the presence of
long-range Coulomb forces has been thought to give rise to such severe
singularities in their kernels that the latter may lack the compactness
property known to exist in the case of purely short-range interactions.
Employing the rigorously equivalent formulation in terms of an
effective-two-body theory we have proved in a preceding paper [Phys. Rev. C
{\bf 61}, 064006 (2000)] that, for all energies, the nondiagonal kernels
occurring in the integral equations which determine the transition amplitudes
for all binary collision processes, possess on and off the energy shell only
integrable singularities, provided all three particles have charges of the same
sign, i.e., all Coulomb interactions are repulsive. In the present paper we
prove that, for particles with charges of equal sign, the diagonal kernels, in
contrast, possess one, but only one, nonintegrable singularity. The latter can,
however, be isolated explicitly and dealt with in a well-defined manner. Taken
together these results imply that modified integral equations can be
formulated, with kernels that become compact after a few iterations. This
concludes the proof that standard solution methods can be used for the
calculation of all binary (i.e., (in-)elastic and rearrangement) amplitudes by
means of momentum space integral equations of the effective-two-body type.

Fermi motion. Simultaneously, the momentum and energy dependence of the s-wave
optical potential, previously developed, are taken into account and shown to
generate a small p-wave correction to the optical potential. All the
corrections considered are small compared to the leading s-wave potential, and
lead to changes in the shifts and widths which are smaller than the
experimental errors.
  A thorough study of the threshold region and low densities is conducted,
revealing mathematical problems for which a physical solution is given.

functions $S_{n}$ for homogeneous isotropic turbulence are derived from the
Navier-Stokes equations by using field theoretic methods to develop a low
energy approximation in which the Kolmogorov theory is shown to act effectively
as a mean field theory. The corrections to the Kolmogorov exponents are
expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators which
occur in the definition of $S_{n}$. These are calculated from the anomalous
scaling of the appropriate class of nonlinear Green's function, using an $uv$
fixed point of the renormalisation group, which thereby establishes the
connection with the dynamics of the turbulence. The main result is an algebraic
expression for $\zeta_{n}$, which contains no adjustable constants.
  It is valid at orders $n$ below $% g_{\ast}^{-1}$, where $g_{\ast}$ is the
fixed point coupling constant. This expression is used to calculate $\zeta
_{n}$ for orders in the range $% n=2$ to 10, and the results are shown to be in
good agreement with experimental data, key examples being $\zeta_{2}=0.7$,
$\zeta_{3}=1$ and $% \zeta_{6}=1.8$.

  Foundations of Physics","Found.Phys. 31 (2001) 1139-1183",,,"physics.class-ph gr-qc physics.gen-ph",,"  Different approaches to special relativity (SR) are discussed. The first
approach is an invariant approach in which physical quantities in the
four-dimensional spacetime are represented by true tensors or equivalently by
coordinate-based geometric quantities comprising both components and a basis.
This approach we call the ''true transformations (TT) relativity.'' It is
compared with the usual covariant approach, which mainly deals with the basis
components of true tensors. The third approach is the usual noncovariant
approach to SR in which some quantities are not tensor quantities, but rather
quantities from ''3+1'' space and time, e.g., the synchronously determined
spatial length. This formulation is called the ''apparent transformations (AT)\
relativity.'' The spacetime length is considered in the ''TT relativity'' and
spatial and temporal distances in the ''AT relativity.'' It is also found that
the usual transformations of the three-vectors of the electric and magnetic
fields $\QTR{bf}{E}$ and $\QTR{bf}{B}$ are the AT. The Maxwell equations with
$F^{ab}$ are written in terms of the 4-vectors of the electric $E^{a}$ and
magnetic $B^{a}$ fields. The covariant Majorana electromagnetic field 4-vector
$\Psi ^{a}$ is constructed by means of 4-vectors $E^{a}$ and $B^{a}$ and the
covariant Majorana formulation of electrodynamics is presented. A Dirac like
relativistic wave equation for the free photon is obtained.

(or in the space of K x K mixed states, if the reduction takes place with

singular values of non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices pertaining to the

microsphere of given complex permittivity that satisfies the Kramers-Kronig
relations is studied, with special emphasis on a Drude-Lorentz permittivity.
Both the whispering gallery field resonances below the band gap (for a
dielectric sphere) and the surface-guided field resonances inside the gap (for
a dielectric or a metallic sphere) are considered. Since the decay rate mimics
the spectral density of the sphere-assisted ground-state fluctuation of the
radiation field, the strengths and widths of the field resonances essentially
determine the feasible enhancement of spontaneous decay. In particular, strong
enhancement can be observed for transition frequencies within the interval in
which the surface-guided field resonances strongly overlap. When material
absorption becomes significant, then the highly structured emission pattern
that can be observed when radiative losses dominate reduces to that of a
strongly absorbing mirror. Accordingly, nonradiative decay becomes dominant. In
particular, if the distance between the atom and the surface of the microsphere
is small enough, the decay becomes purely nonradiative.

that the Hilbert space obtained by using the Kahler polarization is naturally
identifiable with the generalized Segal-Bargmann space introduced by the author
from a different point of view, namely that of heat kernels. The second main
result is that the pairing map of geometric quantization coincides with the
generalized Segal-Bargmann transform introduced by the author. This means that
in this case the pairing map is a constant multiple of a unitary map. For both
results it is essential that the half-form correction be included when using
the Kahler polarization. Together with results of the author with B. Driver,
these results may be seen as an instance of ""quantization commuting with
