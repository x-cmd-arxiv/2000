strongly motivated by modern high-energy physics theories. Comparison of quasar
absorption line spectra with laboratory spectra provides a sensitive probe for
variability of the fine structure constant, alpha, over cosmological
time-scales. We have previously developed and applied a new method providing an
order of magnitude gain in precision over previous optical astrophysical
constraints. Here we extend that work by including new quasar spectra of damped
Lyman-alpha absorption systems. We also re-analyse our previous lower redshift
data and confirm our initial results. The constraints on alpha come from
simultaneous fitting of absorption lines of subsets of the following species:
Mg I, Mg II, Al II, Al III, Si II, Cr II, Fe II, Ni II and Zn II. We present a
detailed description of our methods and results based on an analysis of 49
quasar absorption systems (towards 28 QSOs) covering the redshift range 0.5 < z
< 3.5. There is statistical evidence for a smaller alpha at earlier epochs:
da/a = (-0.72 +/- 0.18) * 10^{-5}. The new and original samples are independent
but separately yield consistent and significant non-zero values of da/a. We
summarise the results of a thorough investigation of systematic effects
published in a companion paper. The value we quote above is the raw value, not
corrected for any of these systematic effects. The only significant systematic
effects so far identified, if removed from our data, would lead to a more
significant deviation of da/a from zero.

a negative Lambda component. This renders possible new types of models that do

magnetic field, the magnetic energy density grows as $\sim t^2$ for the first
few turbulence eddy turnover times, followed by a dynamic growth stage, where
nonlinear interactions between different scales of the turbulence contribute to
an exponential growth rate that is largely determined by the turbulence eddy
turnover time. For a seed magnetic field that is initially set up at a small
scale in the turbulence, during the kinematic development stage, the growth
rate of magnetic energy is $\propto 1/\tau_{max}$, where $\tau_{max}$ is the
eddy turnover time of the smallest eddies of the turbulence. The kinematic
growth stage is followed by a dynamic growth stage, where nonlinearity plays
important role. During such dynamic growth stage, the growth rate of total

particles, fractal BPCA grains, and BCCA grains, we find that even during the

dust size distribution is strongly modified. Close to the disk's midplane
coagulation produces dust particles of sizes of several 10 micons (for compact
spherical grains) up to several mm (for fluffy BCCA grains), whereas in the
vicinity of the accretion shock front (located several density scale heights
above the disk), large velocity differences inhibit coagulation. Dust particles
larger than about 1 micron segregate from the smaller grains behind the
accretion shock. Due to the combined effects of coagulation and grain
segregation the infrared dust emission is modified. Throughout the accretion
disk a MRN dust distribution provides a poor description of the general dust
properties. Estimates of the consequences of the ""freezing out"" of molecules in
protostellar disks should consider strongly modified grains. Physical model
parameters such as the limiting sticking strength and the grains' resistivity
against shattering are crucial factors determining the degree of coagulation
reached. In dense regions (e.g. in the mid-plane of the disk) a steady-state is

different, varied, and still evolving. This is argued with the use of a
structural system that measures the physical conditions of galaxies. This
system provides evidence that starbursts at high-z are triggered by merging,
while nearby starbursts have a host of different triggering mechanisms, none of
which, besides merging, are currently known to exist at z > 2.

of early-type galaxies in two distant regions. Here we describe the maximum
likelihood algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between the
parameters of the EFAR database. One-, two-, and three-dimensional gaussian
models are constructed to determine the mean value and intrinsic spread of the
parameters, and the slopes and intrinsic parallel and orthogonal spread of the
Mgb'-Mg2, Mg2-sigma, Mgb'-sigma relations, and the Fundamental Plane. In the
latter case, the cluster peculiar velocities are also determined. We show that
this method is superior to ``canonical'' approaches of least-squares type,
which give biased slopes and biased peculiar velocities. We test the algorithm
with Monte Carlo simulations of mock EFAR catalogues and derive the systematic
and random errors on the estimated parameters. We find that random errors are
always dominant. We estimate the influence of systematic errors due to the way
clusters were selected and the hard limits and uncertainties in the selection
function parameters for the galaxies. We explore the influence of uniform
distributions in the Fundamental Plane parameters and the errors. We conclude
that the mean peculiar motions of the EFAR clusters can be determined reliably.
In particular, the placement of the two EFAR sample regions relative to the
Lauer and Postman dipole allows us to strongly constrain the amplitude of the
bulk motion in this direction.

  2000. To appear in the Conference Proceedings",,,,"gr-qc",,"  There are models of gravitational collapse in classical general relativity
which admit the formation of naked singularities as well as black holes. These
include fluid models as well as models with scalar fields as matter. Even if
fluid models were to be regarded as unphysical in their matter content, the
remaining class of models (based on scalar fields) generically admit the
formation of visible regions of finite but arbitrarily high curvature. Hence it
is of interest to ask, from the point of view of astrophysics, as to what a
stellar collapse leading to a naked singularity (or to a visible region of very
high curvature) will look like, to a far away observer. The emission of energy
during such a process may be divided into three phases - (i) the classical
phase, during which matter and gravity can both be treated according to the
laws of classical physics, (ii) the semiclassical phase, when gravity is
treated classically but matter behaves as a quantum field, and (iii) the
quantum gravitational phase. In this review, we first give a summary of the
status of naked singularities in classical relativity, and then report some
recent results comparing the semiclassical phase of black holes with the
semiclassical phase of spherical collapse leading to a naked singularity. In
particular, we ask how the quantum particle creation during the collapse
leading to a naked singularity compares with the Hawking radiation from a star
collapsing to form a black hole. It turns out that there is a fundamental
difference between the two cases. A spherical naked star emits only about one
Planck energy during its semiclassical phase, and the further evolution can
only be determined by the laws of quantum gravity. This contrasts with the
semiclassical evaporation of a black hole.

about one 0.5-1 TeV is very convenient from a technical point of view: wave
length of the laser should be about 1 micron, i.e. in the region of most
powerful solid state lasers, collision effects do not restrict the gamma-gamma
luminosity. In the multi-TeV energy region the situation is more complicated:
the optimum laser wave length increases in proportionally with the energy, the
required flash energy also increases due to nonlinear effects in the Compton
scattering; bunch trains are shorter (for warm high gradient linacs), this
leads to higher backgrounds; the collision effects (coherent pair e+e- pair
creation) restrict the luminosity. These problems and possible solutions are
discussed in this paper. A method of laser focusing is considered which allows
the decrease of the required laser flash energy and the practical elimination
of the problem of nonlinear effects in Compton scattering; a way to reduce

completely. Interestingly, imposing Yukawa coupling unification for two
families greatly constrains the range of parameters in the MSSM. Secondly, we
employ a new ansatz for the tri-linear A-terms that satisfies all experimental
and vacuum stability bounds, and can successfully modify the mass relations.
Finally, we investigate the use of general (non-proportional) A-terms, with
large off-diagonal entries. In this case flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)

existence proof, serving to show that Yukawa coupling unification can occur

level partial wave amplitude for each channel and unitarizing by a simple
K-matrix prescription which does not introduce any new parameters. If the
renormalizable version of the model is used there is only one free parameter.
While this highly constrained version has the right general structure to
explain \pi \pi scatteirng, it is ``not quite'' right. A reasonable fit can be
made if the renormalizability (for the {\it effective} Lagrangian) is relaxed
while chiral symmetry is maintained. The occurence of a Ramsauer Townsend
mechanism for the f_0(980) region naturally emerges. The effect of
unitarization is very important and leads to ``physical'' masses for the scalar

``outsiders'' in this picture and to require additional fields. Comparison is
made with a scattering treatment using a more general non-linear sigma model

first principles. In operator formulation, there is a parity symmetry and the
phase can be removed by a change in the representation of the Dirac gamma
matrices. Moreover, these properties are also realized in a Pauli-Villars
regularized version of the theory. In the functional integral scenario,
attempts to remove the chiral phase by a chiral transformation are thought to
be obstructed by a nontrivial Jacobian arising from the fermion measure and the
chiral phase may therefore seem to break parity. But if one starts from the
regularized action with the chiral phase also present in the regulator mass
term, the Jacobian for a combined chiral rotation of quarks and regulators is
seen to be trivial and the phase can be removed by a combined chiral rotation.
This amounts to a taming of the strong CP problem.

class of Isgur-Paton flux tube models and is compared to lattice calculations
of the low-lying SU(N) glueball mass spectra. Our modifications of the model
include a string curvature term and different ways of dealing with the flux
tube width. We find that the generic model is remarkably successful at
reproducing the positive charge conjugation, C=+, sector of the spectrum. The
only large (and robust) discrepancy involves the 0-+ state. This raises the
interesting possibility that the lattice spin identification is mistaken and
that this state is in fact 4-+. In addition, the Isgur-Paton model does not
incorporate any mechanism for splitting C=+ from C=- (in contrast to the case
in 3+1 dimensions), while the `observed' spectrum shows a substantial
splitting. We explore several modifications of the model in an attempt to
incorporate this physics in a natural way. At the qualitative level we find
that this constrains our choice to a picture in which the C=+/- splitting is
driven by mixing with new states built on closed loops of adjoint flux. However
a detailed numerical comparison suggests that a model incorporating an
additional direct mixing between loops of opposite orientation is likely to
work better; and that, in any case, a non-zero curvature term will be required.
We also point out that a characteristic of any string model of glueballs is
that the SU(N=infinity) mass spectrum will consist of multiple towers of states
that are scaled up copies of each other. To test this will require a lattice
mass spectrum that extends to somewhat larger masses than currently available.

a mass $m_J$, equal to $h/2\pi c R$, a corresponding energy, as well as a
charge $q_J$, where $q_J = (hc/2\pi)^{1/2}$. It is also established that
$\ell_\Delta = 2\pi(hG/c^3)^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $G$ is
the gravitational constant. % Based upon investigation of the properties and
characteristics of J-strings, a method is developed for the computation of the
Planck length and mass $(\ell^*_P, m^*_P)$. The values of $\ell^*_P$ and
$m^*_P$ are computed according to the resulting formulae (and given in the
paper); these values differ from the currently accepted ones.

  version, to appear in Selecta",,,,"math.AG math.AT math.CT",,"  This is an expended and revised version of the preprint ""Schematization of

  The purpose of this work is to introduce a notion of \emph{affine stacks},
which is a homotopy version of the notion of affine schemes, and to give
several applications in the context of algebraic topology and algebraic
geometry. As a first application we show how affine stacks can be used in order
to give a new point of view (and new proofs) on rational and $p$-adic homotopy
theory. This gives a first solution to A. Grothendieck's \emph{schematization
problem} described in \cite{gr}. We also use affine stacks in order to
introduce a notion of \emph{schematic homotopy types}. We show that schematic
homotopy types give a second solution to the schematization problem, which also
allows us to go beyound rational and $p$-adic homotopy theory for spaces with
arbitrary fundamental groups. The notion of schematic homotopy types is also
used in order to construct various homotopy types of algebraic varieties
corresponding to various cohomology theories (Betti, de Rham, $l$-adic, ...),
extending the well known constructions of the various fundamental groups.
Finally, as algebraic stacks are obtained by gluing affine schemes we define
\emph{$\infty$-geometric stacks} as a certain gluing of affine stacks. Example
of $\infty$-geometric stacks in the context of algebraic topology (moduli
spaces of dga structures up to quasi-isomorphisms) and Hodge theory
(non-abelian periods) are given.

intelligence activity. We report that, in its so-called turbulent regime,
periodic windows of the element maps foliate and systematically control the
dynamics of the model. We have found various cluster attractors. In one type of
them, the maps split into several almost equally populated clusters and the
clusters mutually oscillate with a period (p) that is the same with the number
of clusters (c). We name them as maximally symmetric cluster attractors
(MSCA's). The most outstanding are the p3c3 MSCA and its bifurcate. The MSCA is
proved to be linearly stable by Lyapunov analysis. There are also cluster
attractors with p>c. They come out in sequences with increasing coupling. The
formation of the clustors in the very weakly coupled chaotic system may suggest
a new form of an intelligence activity.
