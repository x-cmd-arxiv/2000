radiation pressure in circumstellar gas disks, which are in a transitional
stage between the gas-dominated, optically thick, primordial nebulae, and the
dust-dominated, optically thin Vega-type disks. Dust undergo radial migration,
seeking a stable equilibrium orbit in corotation with gas. The migration of
dust gives rise to radial fractionation of dust and creates a variety of
possible observed disk morphologies, which we compute by considering the
equilibrium between the dust production and the dust-dust collisions removing
particles from their equilibrium orbits. Sand-sized and larger grains are
distributed throughout most of the gas disk, with concentration near the gas
pressure maximum in the inner disk. Smaller grains (typically in the range of
10 to 200 micron) concentrate in a prominent ring structure in the outer region
of the gas disk (presumably at radius 100 AU), where gas density is rapidly
declining with radius. The width and density, as well as density contrast of
the dust ring with respect to the inner dust disk depend on the distribution of
gas. Our results open the prospect for deducing the distribution of gas in
circumstellar disks by observing their dust. We have qualitatively compared our
models with two observed transitional disks around HR 4796A and HD 141569A.
Dust migration can result in observation of a ring or a bimodal radial dust
distribution, possibly very similar to the ones produced by gap-opening
planet(s) embedded in the disk, or shepherding it from inside or outside. We
conclude that a convincing planet detection via dust imaging should include
specific non-axisymmetric structure following from the dynamical simulations of
perturbed disks.

from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite whose major-element isotopic
compositions indicate an origin in nova explosions. The grains are
characterized by low 12C/13C (4-9) and 14N/15N (5-20) ratios, large excesses in
30Si (30Si/28Si ratios range to 2.1 times solar) and high 26Al/27Al ratios.
These isotopic signatures are theoretically predicted for the ejecta from ONe
novae and cannot be matched by any other stellar sources. Previous studies of
presolar grains from primitive meteorites have shown that the vast majority
formed in red giant outflows and supernova ejecta. Although a classical nova
origin was suggested for a few presolar graphite grains on the basis of 22Ne
enrichments, this identification is somewhat ambiguous since it is based only
on one trace element. Our present study presents the first evidence for nova
grains on the basis of major element isotopic compositions of single grains. We
also present the results of nucleosynthetic calculations of classical nova
models and compare the predicted isotopic ratios with those of the grains. The
comparison points toward massive ONe novae if the ejecta are mixed with
material of close-to-solar composition.

and cause catastrophic events such as close encounters with a planet or star
during temporary capture, the dynamics of migrating planets is likely to be
strongly dependent on the widths of the resonance chaotic zones. Previous
theoretical work on the resonant capture of particles into mean-motion
resonances by orbital migration has been restricted to the study of integrable
models. By exploring toy drifting Hamiltonian models we illustrate how the
structure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this
integrable capture theory to include the richer phenomenology of chaotic
resonances. We show that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic
zone of a resonance with fixed shape for a time that is given by the width of
the chaotic zone divided by the resonance drift rate. Particles can be
permanently captured into a drifting chaotic resonance only if they are
captured into a growing integrable region. Therefore resonances containing wide
chaotic zones have lower permanent capture probabilities than those lacking
chaotic zones. We expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable
capture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rate is
sufficiently long that many Lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily
captured in the resonance. The 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in the
Kuiper Belt contains a chaotic zone, even when integrated on short timescales
such as a million years. Capture probabilities are lower than estimated
previously from drifting integrable models. This may offer an explanation for
low eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects between 45-47 AU which should have been
previously captured in the 2:1 resonance by Neptune's migration.

field, the rotational energy of the Kerr black hole provides an energy source
for the radiation of the disk in addition to disk accretion. The black hole
exerts a torque on the disk, which transfers energy and angular momentum
between the black hole and the disk. If the black hole rotates faster than the
disk, energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and
transfered to the disk. The energy deposited into the disk is eventually
radiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If
the black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are
transfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of
the disk. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions are
obtained for a thin Keplerian disk magnetically coupled to a Kerr black hole.
By ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given
radius in the disk slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one
rotation period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself. We find
that, the torque produced by the magnetic coupling propagates only outward in
the disk, the total radiation flux of the disk is a superposition of the
radiation flux produced by the magnetic coupling and that produced by
accretion. Most interestingly, a disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly
rotating black hole can radiate without accretion. Such a disk has an infinite
efficiency. For a specific example that the magnetic field touches the disk at
the inner boundary, the radial radiation profile is very different from that of
a standard accretion disk: the emissivity index is significantly bigger, most
radiation comes from a region which is closer to the center of the disk.

outside the dynamo-active region the large scale field amplitude can reach
larger values, but the time scale after which this field is reached increases
linearly with the magnetic Reynolds number. In both cases most of the helicity
flux is found to occur on large scales. From the variety of models considered

compared to the case with periodic boundaries. The rate at which this lower
saturation field strength is attained is roughly independent of the strength of

however, significant field strengths could be reached in a shorter time.

showing very broad polarization humps, narrow features that are associated with
weak absorption lines in the total spectral flux, and sharp reversals across

splitting in the funnel gas in a longitudinal magnetic field B~30kG. The set of

that sample regions of the Fermi surface near the diagonal (B_{2g}) and
principal axes (B_{1g}) of the Brillouin Zone have been utilized. The frequency
dependence of the Raman response function at low energies is found to be linear

Studies of the pair-breaking peak found in the B_{1g} spectra demonstrate that
the magnitude of the maximum gap decreases monotonically with increasing hole

is found that the number of quasiparticles participating in pairing increases

a weak ""pair-breaking peak"" that follows a parabolic-like dependence on hole

into a single neurocomputational substrate. Simulations were performed varying
the dopaminergic modulation and observing the different patterns that emerged
at the semantic map. Assuming that the thought process is the total pattern
elicited at the output layer of the neural network, the model shows how the
normal and abnormal thinking are generated and that there are no borders
between their different manifestations. Actually, a continuum of different
qualitative reasoning, ranging from delusion to disorganization of thought, and
passing through the normal and the creative thinking, seems to be more
plausible. The model is far from explaining the complexities of human thinking
but, at least, it seems to be a good metaphorical and unifying view of the many
facets of this phenomenon usually studied in separated settings.

novel in presupposing neither spacetime nor the relativity principle. We
consider a class of actions defined on superspace with two key properties. The
first is 3-coordinate invariance. This is the only postulated symmetry, and it
leads to the standard momentum constraint. The second property is that the
Lagrangian is constructed from a `local' square root of an expression quadratic
in the velocities, `local' because it is taken before integration over 3-space.
It gives rise to quadratic constraints that do not correspond to any symmetry
and are not, in general, propagated by the Euler-Lagrange equations. Therefore
these actions are internally inconsistent. Only one action of this form is well
behaved: the Baierlein-Sharp-Wheeler reparametrisation-invariant action for GR.
  From this viewpoint, spacetime symmetry is emergent. It appears as a `hidden'
symmetry in the (underdetermined) solutions of the evolution equations, without
being manifestly coded into the action itself. In addition, propagation of the
constraints acts as a striking selection mechanism beyond pure gravity. If a
scalar field is included in the configuration space, it must have the same
characteristic speed as gravity. Thus Einstein causality emerges. Finally,
self-consistency requires that any 3-vector field must satisfy Einstein
causality, the equivalence principle and, in addition, the Gauss constraint.
Therefore we recover the standard (massless) Maxwell equations.

continual measurements) has been formulated by using the notions of instrument
and positive operator valued measure, functional integrals, quantum stochastic
differential equations and classical stochastic differential equations (SDE's).
Various types of SDE's are involved, and precisely linear and non linear
equations for vectors in Hilbert spaces and for trace-class operators. All such
equations contain either a diffusive part, or a jump one, or both.
  In this paper we introduce a class of linear SDE's for trace-class operators,
relevant to the theory of continual measurements, and we recall how such SDE's
are related to instruments and master equations and, so, to the general
formulation of quantum mechanics. We do not present the Hilbert space
formulation of such SDE's and we make some mathematical simplifications: no
time dependence is introduced into the coefficients and only bounded operators
on the Hilbert space of the quantum system are considered. Then we introduce
the notion of a posteriori state and the non linear SDE satisfied by such
states and we give conditions from which such equation is assured to preserve
pure states and to send any mixed state into a pure one for large times.
Finally we review the known results about the existence and uniqueness of
invariant measures in the purely diffusive case and we give some concrete
examples of physical systems.

stationary fluid is presented.
  The primary surface wave, suitably initiated at some radius, is taken to be a
slowly evolving nonlinear cylindrical wave (governed by an appropriate
Korteweg-de Vries equation); the depth is assumed to be varying in a purely
radial direction.
  We consider a $\sech^2$ profile at an initial radius (which is, following our
scalings, rather large), and we describe the evolution as it propagates
radially outwards. This initial profile was chosen because its evolution over
constant depth is understood both analytically and numerically, even though it
is not an exact solitary-wave solution of the cylindrical KdV equation. The
propagation process will introduce reflected and re-reflected components which
will also be described. The precise nature of these reflections is fixed by the
requirements of mass conservation.
  The asymptotic results presented describe the evolution of the primary wave,
the development of an outward shelf and also an inward (reflected) shelf. These
results make use of specific depth variations (which were chosen to simplify
the solution of the relevant equations), and mirror those obtained for the
problem of 1-D plane waves over variable depth, although the details here are
more complex due to the axi-symmetry.

pion and eta yields which are augmented by interpolated data on deuteron
production. With increasing beam energy mu_B drops from 800 MeV to 650 MeV,
while T_c rises from 55 MeV to 90 MeV. For given beam energy mu_B grows with
system size, whereas T_c remains constant. The centrality dependence of the
freeze-out parameters is weak as exemplified by the system Au+Au at 0.8A GeV.
For the highest beam energies the fraction of nucleons excited to resonance
states reaches freeze-out values of nearly 15 %, suggesting resonance densities
close to normal nuclear density at maximum compression. In contrast to the
particle yields, which convey the status at chemical freeze-out, the shapes of
the related transverse-mass spectra do reflect thermal freeze-out. The observed

neutrons in 3He and 3H are given in terms of the three-nucleon wave function
for realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions. To reduce computational complexity,
separable expansions are employed for the nucleon-nucleon potentials. The
results for the light-cone momentum distributions suggest that they are not
very sensitive to the details of the two-body interaction, as long as it has
reasonable short-range repulsion. The unpolarised and polarised structure
functions are examined for both 3He and 3H in order to test the usefulness of
3He as a neutron target. It is found that the measurement of the spin structure
function of polarised 3H would provide a very clear test of the predicted
change in the polarised parton distributions of a bound proton.

of arbitrary heating and the mutual drag of carriers and photons. The
non-stationary and non-uniform distribution function of photons for the all
considered cases is obtained. It is shown that the distribution function of
photons has the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\vec{u}\vec{q}/
\hbar \omega_q) <1 $ and grows exponentially with time for the drift velocities
$(\vec{u}\vec{q}/ \hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. As a result of the analyses of the
phenomena of coupling of the mutual drag system of carriers with the photons,
we obtained some fundamental results: {\bf a)} the finiteness of the mass of
photon (i.e. the rest mass of the photons is not zero); {\bf b)} reality of
tachyons as a quasi-particles with a real mass in amplifying system (or
regime); {\bf c)} the mechanism of the theory of relativity and that of the
Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or mass as
a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field (force)
are the same. These conclusions were obtained as a result of the fact that the
relativistic factor enters the expressions of the distribution function of
photons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form
$[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1}$, but not in the form $[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1/2}$ as in
Einstein's theory. Also it is shown that the velocity of light is an average
velocity of photons in the ground state.

classical data that is produced by a quantum measurement on a quantum state
ensemble. In the previous work it was shown how spurious randomness generally
contained in the outcomes can be eliminated without decreasing the amount of
knowledge, to achieve an amount of data equal to the von Neumann entropy of the
ensemble. Here we extend this result by giving a more refined description of
what constitute equivalent measurements (that is measurements which provide the
same knowledge about the quantum state) and also by considering incomplete
measurements. In particular we show that one can always associate to a POVM
with elements a_j, an equivalent POVM acting on many independent copies of the
system which produces an amount of data asymptotically equal to the entropy
defect of an ensemble canonically associated to the ensemble average state and
the initial measurement (a_j). In the case where the measurement is not
maximally refined this amount of data is strictly less than the von Neumann
entropy, as obtained in the previous work. We also show that this is the best
achievable, i.e. it is impossible to devise a measurement equivalent to the
initial measurement (a_j) that produces less data. We discuss the
interpretation of these results. In particular we show how they can be used to
provide a precise and model independent measure of the amount of knowledge that
is obtained about a quantum state by a quantum measurement. We also discuss in
detail the relation between our results and Holevo's bound, at the same time
providing a new proof of this fundamental inequality.
