  Simulations","31 pages, 15 figures, all jpg files, accepted by ApJ, hard copies
  available upon request",,"10.1086/320241",,"astro-ph",,"  (abridged) We study the nonlinear evolution of the Rossby wave instability in
thin disks using global 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The key questions we are
addressing in this paper are: (1) What happens when the instability becomes
nonlinear? Specifically, does it lead to vortex formation? (2) What is the
detailed behavior of a vortex? (3) Can the instability sustain itself and can
the vortex last a long time? Among various initial equilibria that we have
examined, we generally find that there are three stages of the disk evolution:
(1) The exponential growth of the initial small amplitude perturbations. This
is in excellent agreement with the linear theory; (2) The production of large
scale vortices and their interactions with the background flow, including
shocks. Significant accretion is observed due to these vortices. (3) The
coupling of Rossby waves/vortices with global spiral waves, which facilitates
further accretion throughout the whole disk. Even after more than 20
revolutions at the radius of vortices, we find that the disk maintains a state
that is populated with vortices, shocks, spiral waves/shocks, all of which
transport angular momentum outwards. We elucidate the physics at each stage and
show that there is an efficient outward angular momentum transport in stages
(2) and (3) over most parts of the disk, with an $\alpha$ in the range from
$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$. We show why such vortices prove to be almost ideal
``units'' in transporting angular momentum outwards, namely by positively
correlating the radial and azimuthal velocity components. We find some special
cases in which entropy can remain the same while angular momentum is
transported. We conclude that Rossby wave/vortex instability is an efficient,
purely hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum transport in thin disks.

NGC 1808 and NGC 5728), the velocity dispersion displays a significant drop at
the nucleus, a rarely observed phenomenon. We also detect kinematical
asymmetries (m=1 mode) along the nuclear bar major-axis of NGC 1808 and NGC
5728, dynamical counterparts of corresponding asymmetries in the surface
brightness. We have derived simple dynamical models in an attempt to fit the
kinematics of each galaxy and reconstruct the full velocity field. For all four
targets, the fits are good, and confirm the presence of the decoupled nuclear
components. These models cannot however reproduce the observed central drop in
the dispersion. We suggest that this drop is due to a transient cold nuclear
disc, fuelled by gas inflow along the bar, that has recently formed new stars.

binaries (LMXBs). The luminosity function of the LMXB sources is well-fit by a
broken power-law with a break luminosity comparable to the Eddington luminosity
for a 1.4 solar mass neutron star. It is likely that those sources with
luminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are
mostly neutron stars in binary systems. Spectra were extracted for the total
emission, diffuse emission, and sum of the resolved sources; the spectral fits
for all require a model including both a soft and hard component. The diffuse
emission is predominately soft while the emission from the sources is mostly
hard. Approximately 24% of the diffuse emission arises from unresolved LMXBs,
with the remainder resulting from thermal emission from hot gas. There is a
very bright source at the projected position of the nucleus of the galaxy. The
spectrum and luminosity derived from this central source are consistent with it
being an AGN; the galaxy also is a weak radio source. Finally, the diffuse
emission exhibits significant substructure with an intriguing spiral feature
passing through the center of the galaxy. The X-ray spectrum and surface
brightness of the spiral feature are consistent with adiabatic or shock
compression of ambient gas, but not with cooling. This feature may be due to
compression of the hot interstellar gas by radio lobes or jets associated with
the AGN.

detecting circumstellar disk sources from near-infrared JHKL color-color

fraction for NGC 2024 of ~85% +/- 15%, which confirms earlier published
suggestions that the majority, if not all, of the stars in NGC 2024 formed with
disks, and these disks still exist at the present time. In addition, all but
one of the disk sources identified in our survey lie in the infrared excess
region of the JHKL color-color diagram for the cluster. This demonstrates that
JHKL color-color diagrams are extremely efficient in identifying YSOs with
disks. Of the 14 sources with K - L colors suggestive of protostellar objects,
\~29% are protostellar in nature, while ~7% are true Class I YSOs. This may be
due to extinction producing very red K - L colors in Class II YSOs, thus making
them appear similar in color to protostars. This suggests caution must be
applied when estimating the sizes and lifetimes of protostellar populations
within star forming regions based on K - L colors alone. Finally, we calculate
the luminosities of the Class II YSOs in NGC 2024, rho Oph and Taurus and

galaxy clusters has revealed regions, $\sim 50-100$ kpc, that are populated
with large, $\sim 30 \mu$ G magnetic fields. The magnetic energy of these
coherent regions is $\sim 10^{59-60}$ ergs, and the total magnetic energy over
the whole cluster ($\sim 1$ Mpc across) is expected to be even larger. A
sequence of physical processes that are responsible for the production,
redistribution and dissipation of these magnetic fields is proposed. These
fields are associated with single AGNs within the cluster and therefore with
all galaxies during their AGN phase, simply because only the central
supermassive black holes ($\sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$) have an accessible energy,
$\sim 10^{61}$ ergs. We propose an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo process in an
accretion disk. The disk rotation naturally provides a large winding number,
$\sim 10^{11}$ turns, sufficient to make both large gain and large flux. The
helicity of the dynamo can be generated by the differential plume rotation
derived from star-disk collisions. This helicity generation process has been
demonstrated in the laboratory and the dynamo gain was simulated numerically. A
liquid sodium analog of the dynamo is being built. Speculations are that the
back reaction of the saturated dynamo will lead to the formation of a
force-free magnetic helix, which will carry the energy and flux of the dynamo
away from the accretion disk and redistribute the field within the clusters and
galaxy walls. The magnetic reconnection of a small fraction of this energy
logically is the source of the AGN luminosity, and the remainder of the field
energy should then dominate the free energy of the present-day universe.

The [O II]/Halpha ratio is inversely correlated with luminosity. The scatter in
the [O II]/Halpha ratio and the dependence of the ratio on luminosity are due
in equal parts to reddening and to the metallicity dependent excitation of the
ISM. The uncertainty in star formation rates derived from [O II] fluxes is
therefore large. If Halpha cannot be observed, high S/N Hbeta fluxes are much
preferable to [O II] fluxes for deriving star formation rates. We present

co-rotating with the star and extending out to near the Keplerian co-rotation
radius (2.8 stellar radii). While this is not a unique solution, it is
consistent with previous studies of H-alpha emission that are naturally
explained by large co-rotating prominences. We find no evidence for rotational
modulation of the emission line fluxes. The density diagnostics suggest that
the transition region is formed at constant pressure, with an electron density

nova EX Dra through its outburst cycle with eclipse mapping techniques. The
eclipse maps show evidence of the formation of a one-armed spiral structure in
the disc at the early stages of the outburst and reveal how the disc expands
during the rise until it fills most of the primary Roche lobe at maximum light.
The eclipse maps also suggest the presence of an inward and an outward-moving
heating wave during the rise and an inward-moving cooling wave in the decline.
Our results suggest a systematic deceleration of both the heating and the
cooling waves as they travel across the disc, in agreement with predictions of
the disc instability model. The analysis of the brightness temperature profiles
indicates that most of the disc appears to be in steady-state during quiescence
and at outburst maximum, but not during the intermediate stages. As a general
trend, the mass accretion rate in the outer regions is larger than in the inner
disc on the rising branch, while the opposite holds during the decline branch.
We estimate a mass accretion rate of Mdot= 10^{-8} Msun/yr at outburst maximum
and Mdot= 10^{-9.1} Msun/yr in quiescence. The brightness temperature profile
in quiescence also suggests that the viscosity parameter is high at this stage
which favours the mass-transfer instability model. The uneclipsed light has a
steady component, understood in terms of emission from the red secondary star,
and a variable component that is proportional to the out of eclipse flux and
corresponds to about 3 per cent of the total brightness of the system. The
variable component is interpreted as arising in a disc wind.

conveniently described in terms of counter propagating shear Alfven and slow
waves. Shear Alfven waves control the cascade dynamics. Slow waves play a
passive role and adopt the spectrum set by the shear Alfven waves, as does a
passive scalar. 2) MHD turbulence is anisotropic with energy cascading more
rapidly along k_perp than along k_parallel, where k_perp and k_parallel refer
to wavevector components perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic
field. Anisotropy increases with increasing k_perp. 3) MHD turbulence is
generically strong in the sense that the waves which comprise it suffer order
unity distortions on timescales comparable to their periods. Nevertheless,
turbulent fluctuations are small deep inside the inertial range compared to the
background field. 4) Decaying MHD turbulence is unstable to an increase of the
imbalance between the flux of waves propagating in opposite directions along
the magnetic field. 5) Items 1-4 lend support to the model of strong MHD
turbulence by Goldreich & Sridhar (GS). Results from our simulations are also
consistent with the GS prediction gamma=2/3. The sole notable discrepancy is
that 1D power law spectra, E(k_perp) ~ k_perp^{-alpha}, determined from our

dramati-cally changes many of the usual assumptions about measuring CBIR
performance. Any CBIR benchmark should be designed from a networked systems
standpoint. These benchmarks typically introduce communication overhead because
the real systems they model are distributed applications. We present our
implementation of a client/server benchmark called BIRDS-I to measure image
retrieval performance over the Internet. It has been designed with the trend
toward the use of small personalized wireless systems in mind. Web-based CBIR
implies the use of heteroge-neous image sets, imposing certain constraints on
how the images are organized and the type of performance metrics applicable.
BIRDS-I only requires controlled human intervention for the compilation of the
image collection and none for the generation of ground truth in the measurement
of retrieval accuracy. Benchmark image collections need to be evolved
incrementally toward the storage of millions of images and that scaleup can
only be achieved through the use of computer-aided compilation. Finally, our
scoring metric introduces a tightly optimized image-ranking window.

direct product of a Friedmann, Robertson-Walker (FRW) space and a compact
hyperbolic manifold of dimension $d\geq2$. Cosmology in this space is
particularly interesting. The dynamical evolution of the space-time leads to
the injection of a large entropy into the observable (FRW) universe. The
exponential dependence of surface area on distance in hyperbolic geometry makes
this initial entropy very large, even if the CHM has relatively small diameter
(in fundamental units). This provides an attractive reformulation of the
cosmological entropy problem, in which the large entropy is a consequence of
the topology, though we would argue that a final solution of the entropy
problem requires a dynamical explanation of the topology of spacetime.
Nevertheless, it is reassuring that this entropy can be achieved within the
holographic limit if the ordinary FRW space is also a compact hyperbolic
manifold. In addition, the very large statistical averaging inherent in the
collapse of the initial entropy onto the brane acts to smooth out initial
inhomogeneities. This smoothing is then sufficient to account for the current
homogeneity of the universe. With only mild fine-tuning, the current flatness
of the universe can also then be understood. Finally, recent brane-world
approaches to the hierarchy problem can be readily realized within this
framework.

variable generating function is algebraic of degree 8. Moreover, for any point
(i,j), the length generating function for walks of this type ending at (i,j) is
also algebraic, of degree 2 or 4, and involves the famous Catalan numbers. Our
method is based on the solution of a functional equation, established via a
simple combinatorial argument. It actually works for more general models, in
which walks take their steps in a finite subset of Z^2 satisfying two simple
conditions. The corresponding generating functions are always algebraic. In the
second part of the paper, we derive from our enumerative results a number of
probabilistic corollaries. For instance, we can compute exactly the probability
that an ordinary random walk starting from (i,j) hits for the first time the
horizontal half-axis at position (k,0), for any triple (i,j,k). This
generalizes a question raised by R. Kenyon, which was the starting point of
this paper. Taking uniformly at random all n-step walks on the slit plane, we
also compute the probability that they visit a given point (k,0), and the
average number of visits to this point. In other words, we quantify the
transience of the walks. Finally, we derive an explicit limit law for the

consecutive levels or spacing autocovariances. They can be viewed as a
discretized two point correlation function. Their behavior results from two
different contributions. One corresponds to (universal) random matrix
eigenvalue fluctuations, the other to diffusive or chaotic characteristics of
the corresponding classical motion. A closed formula expressing spacing
autocovariances in terms of classical dynamical zeta functions, including the
Perron-Frobenius operator, is derived. It leads to a simple interpretation in
terms of classical resonances. The theory is applied to zeros of the Riemann
zeta function. A striking correspondence between the associated classical
dynamical zeta functions and the Riemann zeta itself is found. This induces a
resurgence phenomenon where the lowest Riemann zeros appear replicated an
infinite number of times as resonances and sub-resonances in the spacing
autocovariances. The theoretical results are confirmed by existing ``data''.
The present work further extends the already well known semiclassical
interpretation of properties of Riemann zeros.

  Chaos",,"10.1142/S0218127401003681",,"nlin.CD",,"  In this paper possibilities of a stabilization of large amplitude
fluctuations in an intracavity-doubled solid-state laser are studied. The
modification of the cross-saturation coefficient by the effect of spatial
hole-burning is taken into account. The stabilization of the laser radiation by
an increase of the number of modes, as proposed by James et al. (1990) and
Magni et al. (1993), is analyzed. It is found that when the cross-saturation
coefficient is modulated by the spatial hole-burning the stabilization is not
always possible. We propose a new way of obtaining a stable steady-state
configuration based on an increase of the strength of nonlinearity, which leads
to a strong cancellation of modes, so that during the evolution all of the
modes, but a single one, are canceled. Such a steady-state solution is found to
be stable with respect to small perturbations.

to a very long-lived dissipative hadronic rescattering phase which dominates

depend only weakly on the thermalization time tau_i, the critical temperature
T_c (and thus the latent heat), and the specific entropy of the QGP. The
dissipative hadronic stage enforces large variations of the pion emission times
around the mean. Therefore, the model calculations suggest a rapid increase of
R_out/R_side as a function of K_T if a thermalized QGP were formed.

independent quantum states can be solved by mapping the set of nonorthogonal
quantum states onto a set of orthogonal ones, which can then be distinguished
without error. Such nonunitary transformations can be performed conditionally
on quantum systems; a unitary transformation is carried out on a larger system
of which the system of interest is a subsytem, a measurement is performed, and
if the proper result is obtained, the desired nonunitary transformation will
have been performed on the subsystem. We show how to construct generalized
interferometers (multiports), which when combined with measurements on some of
the output ports, implement nonunitary transformations of this type. The input
states are single-photon states in which the photon is divided among several
modes. A number of explicit examples of distinguishing among three
nonorthogonal states are discussed, and the networks that optimally distinguish
among these states are presented.

  with comparisons to related work",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  We treat a relativistically moving particle interacting with a quantum field
from an open system viewpoint of quantum field theory by the method of
influence functionals or closed-time-path coarse-grained effective actions. The
particle trajectory is not prescribed but is determined by the backreaction of
the quantum field in a self-consistent way. Coarse-graining the quantum field
imparts stochastic behavior in the particle trajectory. The formalism is set up
here as a precursor to a first principles derivation of the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation from quantum field theory as the correct
equation of motion valid in the semiclassical limit. This approach also
discerns classical radiation reaction from quantum dissipation in the motion of
a charged particle; only the latter is related to vacuum fluctuations in the
quantum field by a fluctuation-dissipation relation, which we show to exist for
nonequilibrim processes under this type of nonlinear coupling. This formalism
leads naturally to a set of Langevin equations associated with a generalized
ALD equation. These multiparticle stochastic differential equations feature
local dissipation (for massless quantum fields), nonlocal particle-particle
interactions, multiplicative noise, and nonlocal particle-particle
correlations, interrelated in ways characteristic of nonlinear theories,
through generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations.
