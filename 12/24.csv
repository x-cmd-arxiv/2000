the age and distance of the globular cluster omega Cen. Age versus turnoff mass
and age versus luminosity relations from Girardi et al. (2000) yield two
independent estimates of the age, 9.1<t<16.7 Gyr and 12.9<t<18.5 Gyr. The
distance and distance modulus derived by use of the infrared versus surface
brightness relation are d =5385+-300 pc and (m-M)_V=14.06+-0.11. Distances
derived from our infrared surface brightness versus color relation and the Teff
versus B-V color relation of Sekiguchi & Fukugita (2000) disagree by about 10
per cent. Major improvements in the accuracy in estimated age and distance can
be made with better measurements of the masses of the components of OGLEGC17.

virtual photon target, and magnetic spectrometers and calorimeters to measure
the complete kinematics of pion-photon reactions. The COMPASS experiment is
scheduled to begin data runs in 2001. Pion polarizabilities and hybrid mesons
can be studied via the Primakoff reactions pion + gamma ---> pion + gamma and
pion + gamma ---> Hybrid. The electric (alpha) and magnetic (beta) pion and
Kaon polarizabilities characterize their deformation in an electromagnetic
field, as occurs during gamma-pion Compton scattering. They depend on the
rigidity of their internal structures as composite particles, and are therefore
important quantities to test the validity of theoretical models. The
polarizability measurement will provide an important new test of QCD chiral
dynamics. The studies of quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid mesons would improve our
understanding of these exotic mesons. COMPASS may improve previous Primakoff
polarizability and Hybrid studies by two to three orders of magnitude.

in multidimensional complex space and establish results on finite
determination, convergence and local biholomorphic and algebraic equivalence.
Our finite determination result gives sufficient conditions to guarantee that a
formal map as above is uniquely determined by its jet at a point of a
preassigned order. For real-analytic generic submanifolds, we prove convergence
of formal mappings under appropriate assumptions and also give natural
geometric conditions to assure that if two germs of such submanifolds are
formally equivalent, then they are necessarily biholomorphically equivalent. If
the submanifolds are moreover real-algebraic, we address the question of
deciding when biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence. In
particular, we prove that if two real-algebraic hypersurfaces in $\C^N$ are
biholomorphically equivalent, then they are in fact algebraically equivalent.
All the results are first proved in the more general context of ``reflection
ideals"" associated to formal mappings between formal as well as real-analytic
and real-algebraic manifolds.

These corrections can be cast in the form of a boundary potential contributing
to the total Hamiltonian which together with a subsidiary boundary condition is
responsible for the discretization of the energy levels. We show that a
completely analogous formulation (in terms of boundary potentials) is also
possible in standard operator quantum mechanics and that the Wigner and the
operator formulations are also in one-to-one correspondence in the confined
case. In particular, we extend Baker's converse construction to bounded
systems. Finally, we elaborate on the applications of the formalism to the
subject of Wigner trajectories, namely in the context of collision processes
