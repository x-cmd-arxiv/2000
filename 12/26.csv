in the wind. The qualitative orbital variation predicted is similar to that
observed, although the model fails to reproduce the strong orbital asymmetry
(the observed absorption is strongest for phi>0.5). The model predicts a
mid-eclipse X-ray spectrum, due almost entirely to Compton scattering, with a
factor 4 less flux than observed with ASCA. We discuss how the model may need
to be altered to explain the spectral variability of the system.

Ordinary and Anomalous contributions, giving rise to Ordinary and Anomalous
Hall effects, respectively. However, no such decomposition is possible near the
Curie temperature which, in these systems, is close to metal-to-insulator
transition. Rather, for all of these compounds and to a good approximation, the
\rho_{xy} data at various temperatures and magnetic fields collapse (up to an
overall scale), on to a single function of the reduced magnetization
m=M/M_{sat}, the extremum of this function lying at m~0.4. A new mechanism for
the Anomalous Hall Effect in the inelastic hopping regime, which reproduces
these scaling curves, is identified. This mechanism, which is an extension of
Holstein's model for the Ordinary Hall effect in the hopping regime, arises
from the combined effects of the double-exchange-induced quantal phase in
triads of Mn ions and spin-orbit interactions. We identify processes that lead
to the Anomalous Hall Effect for localized carriers and, along the way, analyze
issues of quantum interference in the presence of phonon-assisted hopping. Our
results suggest that, near the ferromagnet-to-paramagnet transition, it is
appropriate to describe transport in manganites in terms of carrier hopping
between states that are localized due to combined effect of magnetic and
non-magnetic disorder. We attribute the qualitative variations in resistivity
characteristics across manganite compounds to the differing strengths of their
carrier self-trapping, and conclude that both disorder-induced localization and
self-trapping effects are important for transport.

  Phase-Integral Method I. General Theory","23 pages, RevTeX, 4 EPS figures, submitted to J. Math. Phys",,"10.1063/1.1399294",,"nlin.SI quant-ph",,"  The present paper concerns the derivation of phase-integral quantization
conditions for the two-centre Coulomb problem under the assumption that the two
Coulomb centres are fixed. With this restriction we treat the general
two-centre Coulomb problem according to the phase-integral method, in which one
uses an {\it a priori} unspecified {\it base function}. We consider base
functions containing three unspecified parameters $C, \tilde C$ and $\Lambda$.
When the absolute value of the magnetic quantum number $m$ is not too small, it
is most appropriate to choose $\Lambda=|m|\ne 0$. When, on the other hand,
$|m|$ is sufficiently small, it is most appropriate to choose $\Lambda = 0$.
Arbitrary-order phase-integral quantization conditions are obtained for these
choices of $\Lambda$. The parameters $C$ and $\tilde C$ are determined from the
requirement that the results of the first and the third order of the
phase-integral approximation coincide, which makes the first-order
approximation as good as possible.
  In order to make the paper to some extent self-contained, a short review of
the phase-integral method is given in the Appendix.

periodic motion is realized after a homoclinic bifurcation, although a stable
periodic orbit is generated via a Hopf bifurcation which occurs just after a
