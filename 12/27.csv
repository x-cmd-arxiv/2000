the model predictions with different observations. For the currently favoured
LCDM model (\Omega_m=0.4, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6 and h=0.65), we obtain, using

parameter and J_{-12} is the total photoionisation rate in units of 10^{-12}

constraint obtained on f is 0.020^2<f<0.032^2. A reliable lower bound on
J_{-12} can be used to put a lower bound on \Omega_B h^2, which can be compared
with similar constraints obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMBR

metallicity dependent yields for the whole range of stellar masses we follow

star formation efficiency within the subclusters are much higher than the

varying amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl). The CTAT concentration is fixed at
42mM and the salt concentration is varied between 0mM to 120mM. On increasing
the salt (NaCl) concentration, we see three distinct regimes in the zero-shear
viscosity and the high frequency plateau modulus data. In regime I, the
zero-shear viscosity shows a weak increase with salt concentration due to
enhanced micellar growth. The decrease in the zero-shear viscosities with salt
concentration in regimes I I and III can be explained in terms of
inter-micellar branching. The most intriguing feature of our data however, is
the anomalous behavior of the high frequency plateau modulus in regime II (0.12
$\le \frac{[NaCl]}{[CTAT]} \le$ 1. 42). In this regime, the plateau modulus
{\it increases} with an increase in NaCl concentration. This is highly
counter-intuitive, since the correlation length of concentration fluctuations

appreciably in the semi-dilute regime. We propose to explain the changes in
regime II in terms of the unbinding of the organic counterions (tosylate) from
the CTA$^{+}$ surfaces on the addition of NaCl. In the nonlinear flow curves of
the samples with high salt content, significant deviations from the predictions

temperature $T^*$. We infer that the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$
has almost no shift in the optimally- and overdoped regimes while it has a
small negative isotopic shift in the underdoped, which increses upon
underdoping. We account also for the possible dynamical nature of the
charge-ordering transition, and explain in this way the spread of the values of
$T^*$ and its of isotopic shift, obtained with experimental probes having
different characteristic timescales.

scatter via their back-reaction on the typically inhomogeneous mean fields.
Starting from initial states which are far from equilibrium we numerically
compute the time evolution of particle distribution functions and observe that
they indeed display approximate thermalization on intermediate time scales by
approaching a Bose-Einstein form. However, for very large times the
distributions drift towards classical-like equipartition.

relates a family of NCOS by Galileo boosts. Starting with a Lorentz-boosted

  physics' February issue",,"10.1023/A:1017538519495",,"nlin.CD",,"  A version of scattering theory that was developed many years ago to treat
nuclear scattering processes, has provided a powerful tool to study
universality in scattering processes involving open quantum systems with
underlying classically chaotic dynamics. Recently, it has been used to make
random matrix theory predictions concerning the statistical properties of
scattering resonances in mesoscopic electron waveguides and electromagnetic
waveguides. We provide a simple derivation of this scattering theory and we
compare its predictions to those obtained from an exactly solvable scattering
model; and we use it to study the scattering of a particle wave from a random
potential. This method may prove useful in distinguishing the effects of chaos
from the effects of disorder in real scattering processes.

from 10muK down to 300nK along with a gain in phase-space density of almost two
orders of magnitude. In a series of measurements of heating and spin
depolarization an incoherent background of resonant photons in the
evanescent-wave diode laser light was found to be the limiting factor at this
stage.

"quant-ph/0012143","Luigi Accardi","Luigi Accardi, Ruben Sabbadini","A Generalization of Grover's Algorithm","20 pages, no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a
unitary operator can amplify a pre-assigned component relative to a particular
basis of a generic vector at the expense of the other components. This leads to
a general method which allows, given a vector and one of its components we want
to amplify, to choose the optimal unitary operator which realizes that goal.
Grover's quantum algorithm is shown to be a particular case of our general
method. However the general structure of the unitary we find is remarkably
similar to that of Grover's one: a sign flip of one component combined with a
reflection with respect to a vector. In Grover's case this vector is fixed; in
our case it depends on a parameter and this allows optimization.
