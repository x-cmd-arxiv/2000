obtain additional evidence to support our assertion that 3EG J2016+3657 is a

the 14 brightest ROSAT X-ray sources in the error circle, of which B2013+370
remains the most likely source of the gamma-rays. We also obtained further
optical photometry of B2013+370 itself which shows that it is variable,
providing additional evidence of its blazar nature. Interestingly, this field
contains, in addition to the blazar, the plerionic supernova remnant CTB 87,
which is too distant to be the EGRET source, and three newly discovered
cataclysmic variables, all five of these X-ray sources falling within 16' of
each other. This illustrates the daunting problem of obtaining complete
identifications of EGRET sources in the Galactic plane.

  from astro-ph version 1",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Silicon nanoparticles (SNPs) have been proposed as the source of the observed
""extended red emission"" (ERE) from interstellar dust. We calculate the thermal
emission expected from such particles in a reflection nebula such as NGC 2023,
and in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Pure neutral Si SNPs would emit
at 16.4 micron (um), while Si/SiO2 SNPs (both neutral and charged) produce a
feature at 20 um. Observational upper limits on the 16.4 um and 20 um features
in NGC 2023 impose upper limits of < 1.5 ppm in pure Si SNPs, and or < 0.2 ppm
in Si/SiO2 SNPs. The observed ERE intensity from NGC 2023 then gives a lower
bound on the required photoluminescence efficiency eta. For foreground
extinction A(0.68um) = 1.2, we find eta > 5% for Si SNPs, or eta > 24% for
Si/SiO2 SNPs in NGC 2023. Measurement of the R band extinction toward the
ERE-emitting region could strengthen these lower limits. The ERE emissivity of
the diffuse ISM appears to require > 42% (> 33%) of solar Si abundance in
Si/SiO2 (Si) SNPs. We predict IR emission spectra and show that DIRBE
photometry appears to rule out such high abundances of free-flying SNPs in the
diffuse ISM. If the ERE is due to SNPs, they must be either in clusters or
attached to larger grains. Future observations by SIRTF will be even more
sensitive to the presence of free-flying SNPs.

homogeneous CeCu2Si2 (Tc = 0.65 K) that revealed critical magnetic fluctuations
at the border to an antiferromagnetic phase. This exotic superconducting phase
evolves into the typical heavy-fermion superconducting phase at minute
pressures exceeding Pc ~ 0.2 GPa. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation data in a
pressure range 0.85 - 2.58 GPa are shown to be accountable by the SCR theory
based on the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi-liquid model. In 0 < P < Pc ~ 0.2
GPa, by contrast, we conclude that the exotic superconducting phase manifests
itself under the unconventional normal state where antiferromagnetic waves
propagate over a long range without any trace of antiferromagnetic order and
thereby the heavy-fermion state breaks up.

  Workshop on Fundamental Problems in QFT, Protvino, June 2000",,,,"hep-ph",,"  This article is designed to focus attention on the Markov-Yukawa
Transversality Principle (MYTP) as a novel paradigm for an exact 3D-4D
interlinkage between the corresponding BSE amplitudes, with a closely parallel
treatment of $q{\bar q}$ and $qqq$ systems, stemming from a common 4-fermion
Lagrangian mediated by gluon (vector)-like exchange. This unique feature of
MYTP owes its origin to a Lorentz- covariant 3D support to the BS kernel, which
acts as a sort of `gauge principle' and distinguishes it from most other 3D
approaches to strong interaction dynamics. Some of the principal approaches in
the latter category are briefly reviewed so as to set the (less familiar) MYTP
in their context. Two specific types of MYTP which provide 3D support to the
BSE kernel, are considered: a) Covariant Instantaneity Ansatz (CIA); b)
Covariant LF/NP ansatz (Cov.LF). Both lead to formaly identical 3D BSE
reductions but produce sharply different 4D structures: Under CIA, the 4D loop
integrals suffer from Lorentz mismatch of the vertex functions, leading to
ill-defined time-like momentum integrals, but Cov LF is free from this disease.
This is illustrated by the pion form factor under Cov LF. The reconstruction of
the 4D $qqq$ wave function is achieved by Green's function techniques. PACS:

corrections to the renormalization group equations in the CSS formalism, we
derive a new extrapolation formalism. We demonstrate that at collider energies,
