accelerated expansion of the Universe, and indirectly, from measurements of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. Dark energy contributes about 2/3
of the critical density, is very smoothly distributed, and has large negative
pressure. Its nature is very much unknown. Most of its discernible consequences
follow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe,
which in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the
Universe, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests.
Absent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe
the dark energy by an effective equation-of-state w=p_X/\rho_X which is allowed
to vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining
w(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram, number counts of galaxies
and clusters, and CMB anisotropy, focusing particular attention on the use of a
sample of several thousand type Ia supernova with redshifts z\lesssim 1.7, as
might be gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive
optimal strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia
supernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the first
measurements of w, supernovae and number counts appear to have the most
potential to probe dark energy.

thermonuclear X-ray bursts were discovered with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) in early 1996. Spectral and timing evidence strongly supports the
conclusion that these oscillations are caused by rotational modulation of the
burst emission and that they reveal the spin frequency of neutron stars in low
mass X-ray binaries, a long sought goal of X-ray astronomy. Studies carried out
over the past year have led to the discovery of burst oscillations in four new
sources, bringing to ten the number with confirmed burst oscillations. I review
the status of our knowledge of these oscillations and indicate how they can be
used to probe the physics of neutron stars. For a few burst oscillation sources
it has been proposed that the strongest and most ubiquitous frequency is
actually the first overtone of the spin frequency and hence that two nearly
antipodal hot spots are present on the neutron star. This inference has
important implications for both the physics of thermonuclear burning as well as
the mass - radius relation for neutron stars, so its confirmation is crucial. I
discuss recent attempts to confirm this hypothesis for 4U 1636-53, the source
for which a signal at the putative fundamental (290 Hz) has been claimed.

[Fe/H] of -1.00+/-0.28 ranging from -1.6 to -0.4. The mean age of dwarf
ellipticals, also determined photometrically, is estimated at 10+/-1 Gyrs
compared to 13 Gyrs for bright Fornax ellipticals. Comparison of our
metallicity color and Mg_2 indices demonstrates that the [Mg/Fe] ratio is lower
in dwarf ellipticals than their more massive cousins, which is consistent with
a longer duration of initial star formation to explain their younger ages.
There is a increase in dwarf metallicity with distance from the Fornax cluster
center where core galaxies are, on average, 0.5 dex more metal-poor than halo
dwarfs. In addition, we find the halo dwarfs are younger in mean age compared
to core dwarfs. One possible explanation is that the intracluster medium ram
pressure strips the gas from dwarf ellipticals halting star formation (old age)
and stopping enrichment (low metallicity) as they enter the core.

string attached to the black hole gives rise to an additional channel for the
energy release. It is demonstrated that when a string crosses the event
horizon, its transverse degrees of freedom are thermally excited and thermal
string perturbations propagate along the string to infinity. The internal
metric induced on the 2D worldsheet of the static string crossing the horizon
describes a 2D black hole. For this reason thermal radiation of string
excitations propagating along the string can be interpreted as Hawking
radiation of the 2D black hole. It is shown that the rate of energy emission
through the string channel is of the same order of magnitude as the bulk
radiation of the black hole. Thus, for N strings attached to the black hole the
efficiency of string channels is increased by factor N. We discuss restrictions
on N which exist because of the finite thickness of strings, the gravitational
backreaction and quantum fluctuations. Our conclusion is that the energy
emission rate by strings can be increased as compared to the standard emission
in the bulk by the factor 10^3 for GUT strings and up to the factor 10^{31} for
electroweak strings.

basic assumptions underlying Kolmogorov's theory of universality of small-scale
turbulent motion. While, until the mid-seventies or so, local isotropy was
accepted as a plausible approximation at high enough Reynolds numbers, various
empirical observations that have accumulated since then suggest that local
isotropy may not obtain at any Reynolds number. These notes examine in some
detail the isotropic and anisotropic contributions to structure functions by
considering their SO(3) decomposition. Viewed in terms of the relative
importance of the isotropic part to the anisotropic parts of structure
functions, the basic conclusion is that the isotropic part dominates the small
scales at least up to order 6. This follows from the fact that, at least up to
that order, there exists a hierarchy of increasingly larger power-law
exponents, corresponding to increasingly higher-order anisotropic sectors of
the SO(3) decomposition. The numerical values of the exponents deduced from
experiment suggest that the anisotropic parts in each order roll off less
sharply than previously thought by dimensional considerations, but they do so
nevertheless.

But mass increases with speed and perhaps with gravity. By SR, mass is
increased over the rest mass by gamma. Rest mass is here postulated to increase
under gravity, by 1/alpha =1+GM/rc^2. We examine the consequences of
introducing this changing mass into Newton's law in flat spacetime. This
variable mass affects the metric, relative to an observer away from the
influence of gravity, contracting both lengths and times (as measured) by
alpha/gamma. The gravitational force, as in orbital calculations, differs from
Newton's law by the factor (gamma/alpha)^3, and is not quite inverse square.
Without adjustable parameters, this accounts fully for the classical tests of
GR. The postulated ""fifth force"" appears at the 10^-9 g level.
Gravitationally-influenced space remains Euclidean, but the mass-metric changes
make it seem curved when measured.

that transparent linear anomalous dispersion can occur when a gain doublet is

at a negative group velocity through a transparent medium with almost no pulse
distortion. Consequently, a {\it negative transit time} is experimentally
observed resulting in the peak of the incident light pulse to exit the medium
even before entering it. This counterintuitive effect is a direct result of the
{\it rephasing} process owing to the wave nature of light and is not at odds
with either causality or Einstein's theory of special relativity.

unsorted database, no such classical quick search algorithm is available. If
the database permits quantum queries, however, then mere digitisation is
sufficient for efficient search. Sorting becomes redundant with the quantum
superposition of states. A quantum algorithm is written down which locates the
