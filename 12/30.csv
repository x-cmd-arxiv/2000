  Journal, April 2001",,"10.1086/319942",,"astro-ph",,"  Eclipses in the 14.4-day period double-lined binary SS Lac were observed
photographically and visually early in the 20th century, but stopped some 50 or
60 years ago. This has been explained by the presence of a distant third star
in the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of
679 days. The plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the line
of sight in response to perturbations from this third object. A recent analysis
by Milone et al. (M00) of all photometric material available for the system,
including a re-measurement of original Harvard plates, has confirmed earlier
reports of changes in the depth of the eclipses as a function of time, which
are due to the third star. In this paper we discuss our detailed analysis of
the eclipse amplitude measurements, and extract from them information on the
change in the inclination angle of the binary over the last century. Our use of
a much improved ephemeris for the system by Torres & Stefanik was found to be
crucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historical
data at our disposal, including the Harvard material used by M00.
Systematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properly
accounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the time
variation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on the
theory of three-body interactions (""regression of the nodes"" effect). The nodal
cycle is found to be about 600 yr, within which TWO eclipse ""seasons"" occur,
each lasting about 100 yr. The non-eclipsing status of the system is expected
to continue until the beginning of the 23rd century.

evolution of low-mass helium white dwarfs (WD). Attention is focused on the
occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during
cooling phases. Initial models from 0.406 to 0.161 solar masses are constructed
by applying mass loss rates at different stages of the RGB evolution of a solar
model. The multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, and
chemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations are
coupled to an evolutionary code. In addition, the same sequences are computed
but neglecting diffusion. We find that element diffusion strongly affects the
structure and cooling history of helium WD. In particular, diffusion induces
the occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in models with masses ranging from
0.18 to 0.41 solar masses, which is in sharp contrast from the situation when
diffusion is neglected. In connection with the further evolution, these
diffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventing
stable nuclear burning from being an appreciable energy source at advanced
stages of evolution. This implies much shorter cooling ages than in the case
when diffusion is neglected. These new WD models are discussed in light of
recent observational data of some millisecond pulsar systems with WD
companions. We find that age discrepancies between the predictions of standard
evolutionary models and such observations appear to be the result of ignoring
element diffusion in such models. Indeed, such discrepancies vanish when
account is made of diffusion.

free-free radiation, the interstellar dust origin of it is left as the only
suspect. Two competing models of this emission exist. The more favored at the
moment is the spinning dust model, the other is the model that uses grains with
strong magnetic response. In the spinning dust model the emission arises from
rapid rotation of ultrasmall grains that have dipole moments, while in the
other model magnetic grains emit due to thermal vibrations of magnetic dipoles.
Both models predict the emission to be partially polarized and this emission
can seriously interfere with the CMB polarization measurements. We discuss
observational signatures that can be used to distinguish and eventually filter
out the polarized component of the microwave dust radiation.

General Relativity are quantized in the framework of BRST and Dirac's canonical
formalisms. The first system to be studied is one featuring a constraint
quadratic in the momenta (the ""super-Hamiltonian"") and a set of constraints
linear in the momenta (the ""supermomentum"" constraints). The starting point is
to realize that the ghost contributions to the supermomentum constraint
operators can be read in terms of the natural volume induced by the constraints
in the orbits. This volume plays a fundamental role in the construction of the
quadratic sector of the nilpotent BRST charge. It is shown that the quantum
theory is invariant under scaling of the super-Hamiltonian. As long as the
system has an intrinsic time, this property translates in a contribution of the
potential to the kinetic term. In this aspect, the results substantially differ
from other works where the scaling invariance is forced by introducing a
coupling to the curvature. The contribution of the potential, far from being
unnatural, is beautifully justified in the light of the Jacobi's principle.
Then, it is shown that the obtained results can be extended to systems with
extrinsic time. In this case, if the metric has a conformal temporal Killing
vector and the potential exhibits a suitable behavior with respect to it, the
role played by the potential in the case of intrinsic time is now played by the
norm of the Killing vector. Finally, the results for the previous cases are
extended to a system featuring two super-Hamiltonian constraints. This step is
extremely important due to the fact that General Relativity features an
infinite number of such constraints satisfying a non trivial algebra among
themselves.

present a supersymmetry-breaking mechanism which has a geometrical origin, and
consists of imposing different boundary conditions between the fermions and
bosons living in the 5d bulk. The scale of supersymmetry breaking is
exponentially small due to the warp factor of the AdS metric. We apply this
mechanism to a supersymmetric standard model where supersymmetry breaking is
transmitted through the AdS bulk to matter fields confined on the Planck-brane.
This leads to a predictable superparticle mass spectrum where the gravitino
mass is $10^{-3}$eV and scalar particles receive masses at the one-loop level
via bulk gauge interactions. We calculate the mass spectrum in full detail
using the 5d AdS propagators. The AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that our 5d
warped model is dual to the ordinary 4d MSSM with a strongly coupled CFT sector
responsible for the breaking of supersymmetry.

systems to a periodic driving signal. We consider two classes of double-well
potentials, symmetric and asymmetric, modulated periodically in time with
period $1/\eps$, where $\eps$ is a moderately (not exponentially) small
parameter. We show that the response of the system changes drastically when the
noise intensity $\sigma$ crosses a threshold value. Below the threshold, paths
are concentrated near one potential well, and have an exponentially small
probability to jump to the other well. Above the threshold, transitions between
the wells occur with probability exponentially close to 1/2 in the symmetric
case, and exponentially close to 1 in the asymmetric case. The transition zones
are localised in time near the points of minimal barrier height. We give a
mathematically rigorous description of the behaviour of individual paths, which
allows us, in particular, to determine the power-law dependence of the critical
noise intensity on $\eps$ and on the minimal barrier height, as well as the
asymptotics of the transition and non-transition probabilities.

light-scattering for the interaction of egg-yolk lecithin (EYL) multilamellar
vesicles (MLV) with Triton X-100 (TX-100), sodium deoxycholate (DOCNa) and
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMB). The suspension of MLV-EYL was mixed with
appropriate volumes of surfactant solution and was left overnight to reaches
thermodynamic equilibrium. Rectan-gular optic diffusion data were used to
compute the solubilization parameters: total surfactant concentrations, at
saturation and solubilization Dtsat and Dtsol respectively, and effective molar
ratios, Resat and Resol respectively. From the Resat value ob-tained
graphically for interaction of vesicles with TX-100 resulted that in vesicle
bilayers a surfactant molecule is surrounded with seven phospholipid molecules
and the Resol value suggests that in mixed micelles ten lipid molecules with
about fifteen surfactant molecules coexist. The values of Resat and Resol in
case of MLV solubilization with DOCNa are 0.07 and 1.1 re-spectively. In case
of vesicles solubilization with CTMB, Resat =0.25 and Resol =3.6 These data
show that the solubilization power at thermodynamic equilibrium for the three
surfactants is in the sequence: CTMB<TX-100<DOCNa.
