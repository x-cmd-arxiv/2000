covering the Lyman-alpha forest at 1.5 < z < 2.4 combined with similar
observations at z > 2.4 from the literature, we have presented the redshift
evolution of the Lyman-alpha forest at 1.5 < z < 4. We applied two parallel
analyses: the tradiational Voigt profile fitting and a statistical measure of
the flux. The general conclusions from both analyses are in good agreement. In
general, the properties of the Lyman-alpha forest at 1.5 < z < 2.4, such as the
different density distribution function, the correlation strengths and the mean
neutral hydrogen opacity, evolve as expected extrapolating from at z > 2.4.
These results suggest the main drive of the redshift evolution of the forest at
1.5 < z < 4 is the Hubble expansion. When combined with the HST observations
from the QSO key project at z < 1.7, a flattening of the line number density
evolution does seem to occur at z ~ 1.2. The result suggests that the ionizing
UV background might not evolve as strongly as a QSO-dominated background,
indicating a contribution to the UV background from galaxies at z < 2. The
lower cut-off Doppler paramter at the fixed column denisty log N = 13.5 shows a
slight increase as z decreases, with a possible local maximum at z ~ 2.9. The
slope of the lower cut-off Doppler parameter is not well-defined with z.
However, it is flatter at z < 3.1 than at z ~ 3.75.

in an irregular relativistic wind. The process has been thought to be
inefficient, converting only a few percent of the kinetic energy into
gamma-rays. We define ultra efficient internal shocks as those in which the
fraction of emitted energy is larger than the fraction of energy given to the
radiating electrons at each collision.
  We show that such a scenario is possible and even plausible. In our model,
colliding shells which do not emit all their internal energy are reflected from
each other and it causes subsequent collisions, allowing more energy to be
emitted. As an example, we obtain about 60% overall efficiency even if the
fraction of energy that goes to electrons is $\epsilon_e=0.1$ provided that the
shells' Lorentz factor varies between 10 and $10^4$.
  The numerical temporal profile reflects well the activity of the source which
ejects the shells, though numerous collisions take place in this model.

the electron-hole symmetric case. When the couplings between the chain and the
reservoirs on the left and right are small, the conductance for even $N$
decreases with increasing $N$ showing a tendency toward a Mott-Hubbard

this behavior is qualitatively different from that in the special case examined
in the previous work. We also study the effects of the asymmetry in the two
couplings. While the perfect transmission due to the Kondo resonance occurs for
any odd $N$ in the symmetric coupling, the conductance for odd $N$ decreases
with increasing $N$ in the case of the asymmetric coupling.

mixing with active neutrinos can be observable. In the second case, the (3+1)
scheme of neutrino mass, which also accommodates the LSND result, can be
reproduced, provided the hierarchy of the mass matrix of active neutrinos is
not strong (the ratio of largest to smallest elements is about two orders of

matter using Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD) model. This is carried out in a
nonperturbative manner including quantum corrections for baryons through a
realignment of vacuum with baryon-antibaryon condensates. This yields the
results of relativistic Hartree approximation of summing over baryonic tadpole
diagrams. The quantum corrections from the scalar meson is also taken into
account in a similar way. This leads to a softening of the equation of state
for the hyperonic matter. The formalism also allows us to do a self consistent
calculation of the in-medium sigma meson mass. The effects of such quantum
corrections on the composition of charge neutral dense matter is considered.
The effect of the resulting EOS on the structure of the neutron stars is also
studied.

found that all of the resulting meson-exchange models can give similar good
descriptions of the $\pi N$ scattering data up to 400 MeV. However they have
significant differences in describing the $\pi NN$ and $\pi N\Delta$ form
factors and the $\pi N$ off-shell t-matrix elements. We point out that these
differences can be best distinguished by investigating the near threshold pion
production from nucleon-nucleon collisions and pion photoproduction on the
nucleon. The consequences of using these models to investigate various
pion-nucleus reactions are also discussed.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:physics/9809029",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past century a succession of five different independent astronomical
phenomena have been discovered, each appearing to be the result of a common
underlying cause that also produces an unaccounted-for acceleration that is:
quite small, centrally directed in the system exhibiting each phenomenon,
non-gravitational, distance independent, and apparently of a common magnitude.
  The present paper analyzes the phenomena and proposes the underlying common
cause, a common solution to the problem that they present.
  Four of the phenomena, in the order of their discovery are:
  1 - In 1933, the indication by galactic rotation curves that there is such an
acceleration present and acting in galaxies but with no observable cause [hence
the postulating of ""Dark Matter""]. Here the acceleration is directed toward the
galactic center, the dominant factor in the mechanics of galaxy rotation.
  2 - In 1998, the Pioneer Anomaly in which the acceleration is directed toward
the Sun, the dominant factor in the mechanics of the Pioneer spacecrafts'
motion.
  3 - In 2008, the Flybys Anomaly for which the acceleration is directed toward
the center of the Earth, the dominant factor in the mechanics of the flyby
motion [as presented in the paper following].
  4 - Also in 2008, confirmed in 2010, the Dark Flow anomaly for which the
acceleration is directed toward the central origin of the overall universe, the
dominant factor in the mechanics of the overall universe, where the Big Bang
and expansion began [as presented in the paper following].
  The earliest of all is
  5 - Hubble's discovery of Redshifts of the light from various distant astral
bodies.

in a Kerr-lens modelocked Cr:LiSGaF laser have been identified: high-order
dispersion, gain saturation, reabsorption from the ground state, and stimulated
Raman scattering. Using the one-dimensional numerical model for the simulation
of the laser cavity, the relative contributions of different factors have been
compared. The Raman effect provides the largest self-frequency shift from the
gain peak (up to 60 nm), followed by the gain saturation (25 nm), while the
high-order dispersion contribution is insignificant (5 nm). Comparison with the
experimental data confirm that the stimulated Raman scattering is a main cause
of the ultrashort pulse self-frequency shift observed in Cr:LiSGaF and Cr:LiSAF
lasers

introduced in Paper I to establish a stochastic theory of relativistic moving
spinless particles in a quantum scalar field. The stochastic regime resting
between the quantum and semi-classical captures the statistical mechanical
attributes of the full theory. Applying the particle-centric world-line
quantization formulation to the quantum field theory of scalar QED we derive a
time-dependent (scalar) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation and show that it
is the correct semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle-field systems without
the need of making the dipole or non-relativistic approximations. Progressing
to the stochastic regime, we derive multiparticle ALD-Langevin equations for
nonlinearly coupled particle-field systems. With these equations we show how to
address time-dependent dissipation/noise/renormalization in the semiclassical
and stochastic limits of QED. We clarify the the relation of radiation
reaction, quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the role that initial
conditions may play in producing non-Lorentz invariant noise. We emphasize the
fundamental role of decoherence in reaching the semiclassical limit, which also
suggests the correct way to think about the issues of runaway solutions and
preacceleration from the presence of third derivative terms in the ALD
equation. We show that the semiclassical self-consistent solutions obtained in
this way are ``paradox'' and pathology free both technically and conceptually.
This self-consistent treatment serves as a new platform for investigations into
problems related to relativistic moving charges.

"quant-ph/0101002","Andrei Khrennikov","Andrei Khrennikov","Hyperbolic quantum mechanics",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  We start to develop the quantization formalism in a hyperbolic Hilbert space.
Generalizing Born's probability interpretation, we found that unitary
transformations in such a Hilbert space represent a new class of
transformations of probabilities which describe a kind of {\it hyperbolic
interference}. The most interesting problem which was generated by our
investigation is to find experimental evidence of hyperbolic interference. The
hyperbolic quantum formalism can also be interesting as a new theory of
probabilistic waves that can be developed parallely to the standard quantum
theory. Comparative analysis of these two wave theories could be useful for
understanding of the role of various structures of the standard quantum
formalism. In particular, one of distinguishing feature of the hyperbolic
quantum formalism is the restricted validity of the superposition principle.
